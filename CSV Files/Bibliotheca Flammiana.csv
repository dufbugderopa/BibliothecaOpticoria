Seventh edition (the first six were all incunables) and a rare and remarkable edition of the author’s chief work. The second edition to have the anatomical figures.  The Conciliator of Pietro d’Abano (1250–1315), who, as the title of the work implies, “tried to reconcile the views of the Arabists and Grecians, marks the rise of the rival school of Padua as a center of medical dialectics, of which Thaddeus and Peter were the patterns for a century… Peter’s Conciliator consists of 210 moot points to be resolved by dispute…which became the fashion for students’ dissertations and disputations even beyond the 17th century” (Garrison, p. 163). “Peter’s greatest and best-known work, the Conciliator, expresses his mediation between the humanistic Greek school, of which he was one of the very earliest forerunners, and the Arabists. It may be called the first product of medical humanism. From that work we learn that he came into contact with Marco Polo. Among the views expressed in the Conciliator that are most worth record may be mentioned the statements that air has weight, that the brain is the source of the nerves, that the heart is the source of both veins and arteries and that the nerves convey sensation and impulses of movement and are to be distinguished from tendons and ligaments — all ideas that were novel at his time. The work was very popular and influential in the northern Italian schools of the fifteenth century” (Charles Singer in the Fascicolo di Medicina). A striking feature of the present edition is the large anatomical woodcut representing two nude figures holding each other by their shoulders; at the abdomen the anatomy of the abdominal muscles is shown. This cut is copied from the one in the 1496 edition, one of the earliest graphic incunabula of anatomy. Abano is credited with performing the first autopsy/dissection in Padua. Besides the Conciliator, this edition contains the Tractatus de venenis, which was the first book on toxicology to be printed in 1472 (G&M 2070), and another tract on the same subject by Pietro Carario de Montefelice.

Coltham's description of 1521 edition:
The present edition by Octavius Scot contains the corrections and annotations by Symphorian Champier, first introduced by Lucantonius de Giunta in his edition of 1520. 'In his Conciliator, d'Abano undertook a superb synthetic program: the reconciliation of medicine with philosophy. In this he states 120 questions that give rise to as many controversies between physicians and philosophers . D'Abano maintained more or less that ""the art of medicine must not consider only things that can be seen and felt."" Hence he possessed a good knowledge of anatomy; he affirmed, in opposition to the authority of Aristotle (who thought the nerves originated in the heart) that the centre of all sensation and motion resides in the brain. His notions of the central nervous system are probably derived from direct visualization. According to d'Abano, the doctor is the symbol of the zealous servant and the collaborator of nature . [He] must be free in his reasoning and must have no ties with scholastic authorities. Such ideas imply a revolt against established and wearisome tradition: they prepare for the rupture with the past and indicate a new path for scientific progress. D'Abano's voice was one of those that, at the dawn of humanism, announced the beginning of the scientific revival.' (DSB, 1:4). The image of the two male figures showing the muscles was not in the first edition of 1472, but first appeared in the Venice edition of 1496. It bears a resemblance to an image used by Berengario in his Commentaria (1521)Pietro d'Abano [also Petrus de Abano] was born near Padua in 1250, and lived for a time in Constantinople before moving to Paris where he attended the University, and where he composed the Conciliator, his most famous work. He is also remembered for De venenis (ca. 1316), considered to be the first printed book on toxicology, discussing poisons and their antidotes in about 1316. It was first printed with his Conciliator at Mantua in 1472. He fell foul of the Inquisition, accused of heresy, though died in prison before standing trial.  There were at least six 15th century and thirteen 16th century editions, and it remained a standard work. Although with numerous annotations, in seemingly two contemporary hands, the copy contains no ownership inscriptions or provenance.

They record anatomical observations made in 1502, 1503, and 1506, and follow the outline of Mundinus’ text on which they are in fact a brief commentary. He quotes numerous authors and presents a broad view of the subject, avoiding certain dogmatic features of contemporary anatomy such as the doctrine of humours or pseudoscientific theories of astrology or physiognomy. He is credited with certain small discoveries or rediscoveries, as those of the fornix and infundibulum; his description of the brain is very good for that time. His work serves as an admirable short introduction to pre-Vesalian anatomy.  A second edition was published in Venice in 1521 and again in the 1522 edition of Ketham.  This may be the earliest medical book with a portrait of the author.

RCPE:  Achillini's 'Anatomical notes' were published posthumously by his brother, Giovanni Filoteo. The work seems to have been based on lecture notes, and in the preface Giovanni recommends the book to students. An early attempt to correct Galen's errors, Achillini is credited with discovery of  the fourth cranial nerve and of the hammer and stapes in the middle ear. He also gives an excellent description of the brain, and clearly describes the duodenum, ileum, and colon.

Alessandro Achillini (1463 – 1512) ‘is remembered for his considerable activity in
research on human anatomy. He gave a good description of the veins of the arm, and he described the seven bones of tarsus, the fornix of the brain, the cerebral ventricles, the infundibulum, and the trochlear nerve. He also described, exactly, the ducts of the submaxillary salivary glands—a discovery generally attributed to the Englishman Thomas Wharton (1614–1673)—and the ileocecal valve, described later by Costanzo Varolio and Gaspard Bauhin. Finally, to Achillini is attributed the first description of the two ossicles of the ear, the malleus and incus’ (DSB, I, 46).",Riolan p. 15; Platner II: 1371; Guenz II: 1314; Crofts 5388 (1521.Venice); Paitoni 5702; Wittwer I: Q969; Sandifort Q109; Libri 1857: 966 = Libri 1859: 12 = Libri 1861: 22 (this copy?); ,"Provenance: Guglielmo Libri, Edwin Clarke (1919-1996).

Guglielmo Libri. described in the catalogue as “uncut, very rare, but especially in this state”.","Achillini, born on 20 October 1463 in Bologna, was celebrated as a lecturer both in medicine and in philosophy at Bologna and Padua, and was styled the second Aristotle. His philosophical works were printed in one volume folio, at Venice, in 1508, and reprinted with considerable additions in 1545, 1551 and 1568. He died at Bologna 2 August 1512.. He studied philosophy and medicine at the university of Bologna, where he was appointed lecturer of philosophy in 1484, and of medicine in 1495. For a short period from 1506 to 1508 he also taught at Padua. Achillini was a famous teacher. His activities as a teacher and participant in the academic activities of Padua are listed by Lind.  Achillini is now mainly remembered for his achievements in medicine. ""He gave a good description of the veins of the arm, and he described the seven bones of tarsus, the fornix of the brain, the cerebral ventricles, the infundibulum and the trochlear nerve. He also described, exactly, the ducts of the submaxillary salivary glands - a discovery generally attributed to the Englishman Thomas Wharton (1614-1673) - and the ileocecal valve, described later by Costanzo Varolio and Gaspard Bauhin. Finally, to Achillini is attributed the first description of the two ossicles of the ear, the malleus and incus"" (DSB).  O'Malley states that Achillini was the first to express ""some reservation about the existence of the Galenic rete mirabile (Vesalius p. 19).
Iowa: Achillini's anatomy was published posthumously by his brother, Giovanni Filoteo (1466-1538). The book is dedicated to Monti, professor at Bologna and a former student of Achillini's. In the dedicatory letter, Giovanni stresses the great value of the book to students as well as its compact format. In keeping with its title--Anatomical notes--the work appears to have been assembled from his lecture notes and, although Mondino (see No. 97 ff.) is seldom mentioned, the text follows Mondino's organization very closely, with exception of a brief section at the end of the book. This section delineates the eighteen sutures of the skull and has been drawn from Albertus Magnus' (see No. 89) De animalibus. The work was not included in his Opera perhaps because Achillini did not regard it as suitable for publication. From the dates cited in the text, the book reflects his knowledge of anatomy during the years 1502-1506. Achillini had a broad understanding of the subject, quoted a large number of authorities, and provided a broad perspective of views. He did not hesitate to give his own interpretation when he disagreed with another's viewpoint. Various authorities have credited Achillini with showing that the tarsus had seven bones, with rediscovering the fornix and infundibulum, and with discovering the malleus and incus bones in the ear; however, there is some uncertainty about Achillini's part in these discoveries. He did give an excellent description of the brain, the trochlear nerve, and mentioned the eighth pair of cranial nerves. He wrote on the ileocecal valve and clearly described the duodenum, ileum, and colon. The two poems to the reader beneath Achillini's portrait were written by Annibale Camillo of Correggio.

Achillini was a famous teacher. While he was known as a philosopher during his own lifetime, Achillini is now mainly remembered for his achievements in medicine. ""He gave a good description of the veins of the arm, and he described the seven bones of tarsus, the fornix of the brain, the cerebral ventricles, the infundibulum and the trochlear nerve.

ACHILLINI, ALESSANDRO (1463-1512), Italian philosopher, born 20 October 1463 at Bologna, was celebrated as a lecturer both in medicine and in philosophy at Bologna and Padua, and was styled the second Aristotle. His philosophical works were printed in one volume folio, at Venice, in 1508, and reprinted with considerable additions in 1545, 1551 and 1568. He was also distinguished as an anatomist among his writings being Corporis humani Anatomia (Venice, 1516-1524), and Anatomicae Annotationes (Bologna, 1520). He died at Bologna on 2 August 1512.

His brother, Giovanni Filoteo Achillini (1466-1533), was the author of Viridario and other writings, verse and prose, and his grandnephew, Claudio Achillini (1574-1640), was a lawyer

A Dominican friar, Albertus Magnus was Thomas Aquinas’s teacher and one of the most knowledgeable students of the Aristotelian corpus. De animalibus provides not only a practical compendium of Aristotle’s zoological works, but also numerous integrations arising from Albertus’s direct observation of nature.

 ""The year 1249 marked a turning point in the intellectual career of Albert the Great.  This was the year he finally acceded to the pleas of his Dominican confreres to compose a work explaining the natural science of Aristotle. The immediate product of this decision was Albert's paraphrastic commentary on the Physics, but there were long-term results as well. This work was but the first part of what was to become one of the major literary productions of the Middle Ages; a production which would establish Albert as, according to his envious contemporary Roger Bacon, an auctoritas on equal footing with Avicenna, Averroes, and Aristotle himself. Albert's project, intended to 'make the new learning of Aristotle intelligible to the Latins,' was largely concerned with the natural sciences. He not only commented extensively on all of Aristotle's libri naturales; but also recorded his own extensive researches in several fields. By far the largest part of this vast compilation of the sciences is that devoted to zoology. Albert’s massive De animalibus libri XXVI is not only the longest of his Aristotelian commentaries but also represents one of the most extensive records of empirical observation published before modern times.""

A good copy in a modern vellum; scholarly annotations and underlining in contemporary German hand over the whole book, using two different inks and summarising a sentence from Augustine on title; modern letter by a former owner attached to verso of front end paper; contemporary red edges.  The best illustrated incunable edition of this renowned textbook of natural philosophy and psychology, which was used in schools throughout the Middle Ages. It first appeared in Toulouse about 1480. This edition by Giorgio Arrivabene comprised larger copies of the beautiful woodcuts published by Battista Farfengo in 1490 and 1493. The text, drawn from Farfengo’s publications, includes an excerpt on the twelve passions of the soul from De regimine principum by Giles of Rome (ff. giv-giiiv). The Philosophia pauperum (philosophy for simple folk) gathered extracts from writings of the scholastic thinker Albert the Great (c.1193-1280). His influential works and Aristotelian commentaries were often summed up by his students and confreres for the instruction of the less learned. In earlier manuscripts, the Philosophia is ascribed only to a ‘Brother Albert, O.P.’, while others mention an ‘Albert of Orlamünde’, a Dominican teacher in Thüringen. Its authorship remains debated. The work consists of an accessible adaption of the first four treatises by Aristotle (Physics, De Coelo, De generatione et corruptione, Meteorology) as well as of his De Anima. In this last part, the author’s interpretation is strongly influenced by Avicenna, especially with regard to the human soul. The ventricles and faculties of the brain are discussed according to the medieval Cell Doctrine of the nervous system, which envisaged the existence of the three cerebral sections hosting respectively common sense, reason and memory. Imagination is also said to play an important part in the cognitive process, if one is able to distinguish between real and false with reason. The impressive woodcut at f. evir provides a representation of a treble brain. This was the thurd independent printed image of the organ, after the two, slightly different and smaller, issued by Farfengo in 1490 and 1493.

(66) lvs., incl. last blank. Early sixteenth century edition of this popular treatise,with a woodcut of the ventricular man different from the earliest editions. In earlier manuscripts this Philosophy for the simple (Philosophia pauperum, first published in Brixen in 1490; later editions Brescia 1493, Venice 1496, Leipzig 1502 and 1505), as the work was sometimes also called, is ascribed only to a 'Brother Albert, O.P.'. Other manuscripts are more specific, mentioning an 'Albert of Orlamünde'. Scholars now believe that it was this Albert (fl. late 13th c.), a Dominican teacher in Thüringen, who compiled these digests, which summarize and explain Aristotle's ideas on physics, metaphysics, and mathematics. Three parts are dedicated to heaven and earth, the elements and meteorology, and another part describes the 'anima' in every detail: the soul and mind of the human being and the spirit of animals and plants, the five senses, the human intelligence to invent, judge, memorize and interpret, and emotions like sensibility, sensuality, desire, love, affection, and fear. Other aspects of the mind like fantasy, imagination, dreams, the will, and even the control of the limbs are treated as well. The work is a fine example of the way Aristotle was introduced to students and how Greek and Arab science were taught by Albertus Magnus at the universities. The work provides in fact a short textbook of natural philosophy and psychology which was used in schools throughout the Middle Ages. In the chapter about the soul (De anima) the author discusses the three ventricles of the brain as it is represented in the illustration on f. 46r: a diagram of the ventricles of the brain, sort of a 2D version of a phrenological model, with three perfect circles neatly packed into the brain case. Albertus Magnus was born sometime between 1193 and 1206, in Lauingen in Bavaria Contemporaries such as Roger Bacon applied the term 'Magnus' to Albertus during his own lifetime, referring to his immense reputation as a scholar and philosopher. Albertus was educated principally at Padua, where he received instruction in Aristotle's writings. In 1223 (or 1221) he became a member of the Dominican Order, against the wishes of his family, and studied theology at Bologna and elsewhere. Selected to fill the position of lecturer at Cologne, Germany, where the Dominicans had a house, he taught for several years there, at Regensburg, Freiburg, Strasbourg and Hildesheim. In 1245 he went to Paris, received his doctorate and taught for some time as a master of theology with great success. During this time Thomas Aquinas began to study under Albertus.

","Woodcut printer's device on title, woodcut initials, and 2 woodcut illustrations of a splint and an orthopedic boot.  First edition of this treatise by Spain's most outstanding surgeon of the sixteenth century. This work on wounds of the head and other parts of the body was notable for improving the conditions, as well as educating and reforming the technique and ethics, of his profession. In treating wounds and physical deformities, the author provides information on fevers and various treatments for illnesses, including drug-related remedies. Arceo ""believed in healing by first intention, described an operative technique for removal of the breast for cancer, and discusses the treatment of talipes with a special shoe of his design"" (Leonardo). In addition, he describes a new rhinoplastic method and was the inventor of a special balm. Arceo (1493-1575) of Fregenal was so highly esteemed as a surgeon, that patients visited him from foreign countries. His name is preserved to us today in the balsamun Arcaei that he invented. Edited by Benedictus Arias Montanus (1527-1598) with annotations by Alvaro Nuñez.  

The English translation by John Read in 1588: A most excellent and compendious method of curing woundes in the head, and in other partes of the body, London, Thomas East contains the first printing of the Hippocratic Oath in English. The book was also translated into German and Dutch.

 Only Lier seems to have offered this first edition before this copy at Sotheby's in 2005.

Francisco de Arceo (1493-?1573), who studied medicine and surgery at Alcala and who was for a while physician attending surgical patients at the monastery-hospital at Guadalupe, was also one of the more distinguished surgeons of the 16th century. His one-time fellow student and continuing close friend the theologian, statesman, and philosopher Benito Arias Montania (1526-1611), who edited Arceo's principal surgical treatise published after his death, recorded in his preface that Arceo continued to perform successful operations into his 80s. He was particularly famed for his empyema operations, and patients came to him from all over Europe, even from France and England. The basic principles set forth in his De recta curandorum vulnerum ratione (Antwerp, 1574) were those of Pare: simplicity, cleanliness, and a proper humility on the part of the practitioner. He added a detailed dispensary to his work and developed a balm which was later called after him (balsamo de Arceo), and a method of rhinoplasty antedating that of Tagliacozzi. His major work, which was divided into two books, the first dealing with wounds and fractures of the head, and the second with wounds of the rest of the body and (briefly) with ulcers and syphilis, was translated into English as 'A most excellent and compendious method of curing woundes in the head', (trans. J Read, London, 1588), and reached German translations in 1600, 1674 and 1717, and a Dutch translation in 1667. Though his theoretical views were naturally based on Galen and Avicenna, he was responsible for simplification of treatment, improvements in dressings and instruments, and for such experiments as the treatment of malaria with sarsaparilla.","Maunsell II: p. 1 (Eng); Fuiren p. 96; van der Linden 47: 488; Gras p. 48; Fr.

Fourth edition 12 September 1499. Earlier editions: 1480, 1492, 1497.  Pietro d'Argelata (d. 1423) was the most distinguished pupil of Guy de Chauliac, and the principal surgeon between Guy and Giovanni da Vigo. He was professor at Bologna, and his Cirurgia was first published in 1480, edited by Matthaeus Moretus. He “taught the dry treatment of wounds, but powdered them; was skilled in dentistry, used sutures and drainage-tubes in wounds, trephined the skull, incised the linea alba in post-mortem Caesarean section, and sometimes operated for hernia, stone, and fistula in ano” (Garrison). He recommended compressing bandages in chronic ulcers, did not sew up wounds of nerves, cauterised varicose veins, and accomplished the removal of teeth by medicine rather than by pulling them out.  The work contains a careful review of earlier literature with numerous references. The various chapters cover wounds in general and of particular parts, and ulcers in general and of particular parts. Other chapters on specific disorders include hernia and scabies, and parts of the body include the eyes, eats, teeth and gums, skin, nerves, spine, etc. It contains a post-mortem, carried out on the body of Pope Alexander V, who died suddenly and mysteriously in Bologna in 1410 (Long, p. 62).  The annotations in this copy range from a brief note or even a single word to much longer notes occupying a whole margin. They are most extensive in the chapters on wounds.

It served as the scholastic canon of Salernitan medical teaching consisting, at first, of four works: Aphorisms, Prognostics. De regimine acutorum and Tegni.  Other works became incorporated into the collection which was variously know as Ars Medicine, Ars Commentata or Articella.  Blind stamped goatskin over wood. Inscribed on front pastedown: ""Liber Doctoris Hartmanni Schedel de Nuremberga"".  Illuminated initials.  First dated printing of the Hippocratic Oath on f. 211 in Petrus Paulus Vergerius's translation. On f. 210 appears De divisione librorum Galieni by Gentilis de Fulgineo (ca. 1230-1310) which is the earliest printed bibliography of any medical writer and, according to Besterman, is preceded only by the 1467 bibliographies of St. Jerome and Gennadius Massiliensis (Verona, Boninus de Boninis, c. 1475-1483) [Goff P-298; see 2001 Countway Library exhibit of incunables]. Early use of running titles, signatures, a register and foliation in Arabic numerals.  Second printing of the Articella, the first to contain the Oath and to be dated.  Schedel's library was sold by his grandson to Johann Jakob Fugger (1516-1575) and became one of the foundations of the Bavarian State Library.  The Oath also appears in Perottus, Nicolaus. De generibus metrorum [1483-1490]  With Hippocrates, Iusjurandum. Verona B. de Boninis (Poynter 410 = L'Art Ancien 1928).    NYAM has e.p. of Celsus 1478 with Schedel ex libris pasted on newer endpaper.  Osler 7416 is a 1487 edition of the Articella also edited by Franciscus Argilagnes of Valencia.  

Perhaps one of the earliest books printed with a register without catchwords. See Haebler p. 58 where he attributes this to Lichtenstein in his Catholicon dated 24 September 1483, six months later than the Articella.

De divisione librorum Galeni IN: Articella seu Opus artis medicinae. Venice: Hermannus Liechtenstein, 1483.
Considering the central importance of Galen's writings in medicine from the time he wrote well through the sixteenth and even the seventeenth century, and the need for physicians to make sense of such a large number of his texts, it does not seem surprising that the first printed bibliography of any medical author would be De divisione librorum Galeni by the fourteenth century Italian physician Gentile da Foligno (Gentilis Fulginas) who appears to have been one of the first European physicians to perform a dissection on a human (1341). Gentile's very brief listing was first published in the collective volume, containing over ten short texts, entitled Articella su Opus artis medicinae edited by Franciscus Argilagnes of Valencia, and published in Venice by Hermannus Liechtenstein on March 29, 1483. The Articella was used as a textbook or reference work in the early medical schools. Among the other works published in that volume was the first printing (in Latin) of the Hippocratic Oath.

Theodorus Gaza's translation of Aristotle's three main zoological works: De historia animalium, De partibus animalium and De generatione animalium. They were the first collection of treatises on biology to be printed when the first edition appeared at Venice in 1476, and none of these texts were included in the Opera until the Aldine Greek edition of 1495-1498. ""Historia Animalium is an immense collection of biological data - anatomical, physiological, behavioral - on over 500 species of animals. Aristotle's interest lay in identifying and classifying groups of animals and in explaining their functioning as a part of nature, and it was the data reported in Historia animalium, that provided the basis for his philosophical analyses of relationships between structure, function and purpose. In De partibus animalium he explored these ""links of causation"" in the various groups of animals. In De generatione animalium he dealt with the principles of animal generation, including organs and secretions, gave a detailed account of generation in the different groups of animals, answered various questions connected with generation, and finally gave an explanation of development after birth and the differences between individuals of the same species"" (Grolier, Medicine 2A).

Two medicine treatises, bound together by Dr. Hector Pomer, a prior from Nuremberg during the Reformation, with his bookplate, attributed to Albrecht Durer or his disciple Sebald Beham (1500 – 1550), in a contemporary binding with a recorded price and date of the binding in 1525 on the rear pastedown. 

Vilanovanus (c. 1240–1311) was a Spanish doctor, theologian and alchemist, possibly born in Catalonia (perhaps Lerida) as Menedez Pelayo asserts, or Valencia clericus valentinae diocesis. His medical studies were in Montpellier until 1260, before going to Naples and Salerno, where he apparently studied under Arab and Jewish doctors, including Raimundo Marti.  He became personal physician Pedro III and James II of Aragon; While on a diplomatic mission to Philip IV of France, he presented his De adventu Antichristi, a work that would gain him enemies and censorship, and eventually imprisonment. 

On the front pastedown is a fine large woodcut depicting a full-length figure of Saint Lawrence, traditionally attributed to Albrecht Durer (who is known to have made several plates destined for bookplates), with modern scholarship also giving it as possibly his disciple Sebald Beham (National Gallery, Rosenwald Collection). It is one of the earliest known bookplates, with earlier examples dating to c.1480, for books of the Carthusian monastery of Bruxheim; other examples of German artists who produced bookplates are Cranach, Holbein, Solis, and Amman, later in the 16th century. The bookplate was made for Dr. Hector Pömer (1495-1541), featuring St. Lawrence –reflecting Pomer became provost of the Nuremberg parish of St. Lorenz in 1520-, and a escutcheon “with the Pömer arms and the gridiron of St Laurence, with crest, helm and mantling. Placed under an arch, St. Laurence standing on the left. In the four corners small escutcheons with the arms of Pömer, Rummel, Schmiedmaier and Bergmeister.” (British Museum, 1895,0122.748, acquired in 1895).

On the incipit page, the running title includes Nicolaus Jenson Galicus, thus making this an early example of a proto-titlepage.

Sixth overall  and second Venetian edition.  The present edition was issued a few months after Sixtus IV conferred upon the Frenchman the title of Count Palatine (announced in a letter printed at the end of the Decretales of March 1475). Following a three-year lull provoked by the crisis in the book trade, Jenson's press resumed the steady pace of the first two years of its activity, producing a total of 13 known editions. Variant settings are known of 1/2r, line 1 and for the colophon: this copy corresponds in both to the main entries of GW and BMC.

Loosely inserted is a tailor’s bill addressed to one Mychell Constable by Thomas Clarke, dated January 1624.

Augustine's De Civitate Dei appeared in print for the first time in 1467 at Subiaco, printed by Conradus Sweynheym and Arnoldus Pannartz. The first Venetian edition of the City of God was printed by Johannes and Vindelinus de Spira in 1470. This second Venetian edition is the only edition of Augustine issued by French printer Nicolas Jenson (1420-1480), the second printer in Venice, whose publications numbered over 100 works and equaled the best, and often surpassed, all Venetian fifteenth-century printed books in beauty and importance.

Jenson's types, the often-magnificent impressions, and the mise-en-page of his books, are considered milestones in the history of printing; his very name is synonymous with excellence. Along with his Pliny of 1472 and his Plutarch's Lives of 1478, the City of God is one of Jenson's most beautiful works. The present text is buttressed by wide margins, and entirely rubricated by hand in red and blue.

A seminal Christian text, Augustine's City of God had considerable influence not only on Medieval but also Renaissance thought. Augustine has been called ""the first medieval man and the last classical man"" (Thomas Cahill, How The Irish saved Civilization, chapter 2). Martin Luther, John Calvin, Thomas Aquinas, Emperor Charlemagne, Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and many other theologians and philosophers were inspired by this work. Like the Bible, the City of God has been a major topic of debate for theologians, historians, politicians, and philosophers throughout the ages.

The City of God was written between 413 and 426 and represents the first Christian philosophy of history. ""The impulse to the writing of the 22 books of the 'City of God', which was spread over several years, arose out of the fall of Rome to Alaric in 410. The event had caused consternation throughout the civilized world, and Augustine, who himself was profoundly moved, conceived the book as a reply to pagans who maintained that the fall of the city was due to the abolition of the heathen worship. It led him to deal with the fundamental contrast between Christianity and the world, and has made it the supreme exposition of a Christian philosophy of history.""-Cross, F.L., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, p. 107. ""The first five books deal with the polytheism of Rome, the second five with Greek philosophy, particularly Platonism and Neo-Platonism (which are seen as leading inevitably to Christianity in which their problems are finally resolved), and the last twelve books with the history of time and eternity as set out in the Bible. History is conceived as the struggle between two communities - the Civitas coelestis of those inspired by the love of God, leading to contempt of self, and the Civitas terrena or diaboli of those living according to man, which may lead to contempt of God. This struggle of the two conceptions of life had dominated Augustine's personal life and is here transferred to the wider field of world history. Both these powers fighting for the allegiance of the human soul are inextricably intermingled in society's earthly institutions; but history is understood as a continuous evolution of the divine purpose and all forces work towards redemption of man by God's grace, the central feature of St Augustine's theology. It is for this reason that he is considered as the founder of a new science, to which Voltaire assigned the name 'philosophy of history'. For the first time a comprehensive survey of human history is presentedâ€¦ ""In economics Augustine praised labour as a means towards moral perfection; interest charges on money were not allowed under his system, but trade could be carried on, if selling was done honestly and a 'just price' was charged and paid. Many of the medieval regulations about commerce and prices were derived from these ideas, and his contrasting description of a just ruler (imbued with piety, humility, fairness) and the tyrant or Antichrist (impiety, craving for glory) powerfully influenced Renaissance thoughtâ€¦ ""'The City of God' pervaded the whole Middle Agesâ€¦The book remained authoritative until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuriesâ€¦The idea of international law was partly derived from the book.""-Printing & the Mind of Man 3-(1st edition: Subiaco, 1467).
The City of God is St. Augustine's fifth-century response to assertions that Christianity had caused the decline of Rome: In defending Christianity, this Church Father delves deeply into many profound questions of theology, including the suffering of the righteous, the existence of evil, the conflict between free will and divine omniscience, and the doctrine of original sin. It is considered one of the saint's most important works, a cornerstone of Western thought, and a long-established work in the traditional canon of the ""great books.""

Late 15th/ early 16th-century typical and very nice South German binding of blind-stamped calf over wooden boards in a panel design, surrounded by rosettes alternating with diamond-shaped stamps incorporating a lily or a unicorn, 2 bands with fantasy animals, inner panel with interlaced rose twigs and small flowers on front cover, two different bands forming an ""X"" on lower cover, 2 brass clasps (leather restored, flyleaves renewed). An attractive, wide-margined copy of a great early printed text, here present in its second Nuremberg edition. The ""Catholicon"" was the first dictionary to be printed, and is the first printed text of any work in the field of secular knowledge: an encyclopaedic compendium, dealing with orthography, prosody, grammar, rhetoric, and etymology. A great number of manuscripts extant testify to the work's popularity right from the beginning. It was compiled around 1286 by Johannes Balbus, a Dominican from Genoa (died about 1298), and consist of five parts; the first four parts are text books of grammar and rhetoric; the fifth part is an encyclopaedia-dictionary comprising more than 14,000 entries covering all fields of knowlege. The name of the work, ""Catholicon"" indicates that its scope was intended to be universal. During the 14th and 15th centuries, it was used frequently for the instruction of the Latin language to lay people. A copy of the first edition (Mainz, Johannes Gutenberg, 1460) was part of the books collected by Christopher Columbus (today Madrid, BN I/1298-99). Balbus relied on older sources such as Isidorus of Seville, Papias and Huguccio. - Ungainly stain at upper inner corner at the beginning, especially the first leaf, repair to lower outer corner of leaf z6, 12 leaves somewhat shorter at lower edge, a few minimal flaws, some neat ms. marginalia (?Becker), some underlinings in red or blue, rubrication stops at leaf cc. 

Balbus, a Dominican friar from Genoa, completed this work in 1286. It contains treatises on orthography, etymology, grammar, prosody, and rhetoric, but is best known for its etymological dictionary of the Latin language, which occupies the greater part of the text. This was apparently the first lexicographical work to achieve complete alphabetization from the first to the last letter of each word. It remained the standard Latin dictionary into the sixteenth century. Many manuscripts survive, and there were no fewer than 24 incunable editions. The first edition, sometimes attributed to Johann Gutenberg and extant in three issues, was printed by a revolutionary technique using two-line “stereotyped” slugs, but the subsequent editions were printed using moveable type in the standard manner. The printed of this edition, known as the R-printer, so named from the “bizarre” shape of the capital R that appears in his works, is now considered to have been Adolf Rusch von Ingweiler. Rusch printed in Strasbourg in the 1460s and 1470s, often in collaboration with Johann Mentelin, the first printer in Strasbourg, whose daughter he married.","de Croÿ p. 118; Heinsius Litt F45 (1493); Bentes III Human F65 (1483 Venice); Bigot F 1613 (1487); Ch.

Its literary merit is very considerable, and the London Editor of Stephani Thesaurus Latinus has pronounced it the best Dictionary for the Latin Fathers and Schoolmen. Undoubtedly it must be regarded, both for printing and paper, a splendid specimen of Gutenberg's typographical skill. Its rarity is too well known to require any comment, and the price (£65. 2s.) paid for this copy in the sale of Sir M. Sykes, is sufficient to stamp its monetary value.

The Summa grammaticalis quae vocatur Catholicon, or Catholicon (from the Greek Καθολικόν, universal), is a 13th-century Latin dictionary which found wide use throughout Christendom. Some of the entries contain encyclopedic information, and a Latin grammar is also included. The work was created by John Balbi (Johannes Januensis de Balbis), of Genoa, a Dominican,[1] who finished it on March 7, 1286. The work served in the late Middle Ages to interpret the Bible ""correctly"". The educated citizen could gather from it the substantial knowledge of his time. From 1286 to the late 15th century it was available mainly in manuscripts held by monastic libraries. The Catholicon was one of the first books to be printed, using the new printing technology of Johannes Gutenberg in 1460.

The colophon of the book (in Latin) refers to the technology used: ""With the help of the Most High ... this noble book Catholicon has been printed and accomplished without the help of reed, stylus or pen but by the wondrous agreement, proportion and harmony of punches and types, in the year of our Lord's incarnation 1460 in the noble city of Mainz of the renowned German nation ..."". S. H. Steinberg in his book Five Hundred Years of Printing (1955) makes these observations ""the type is about a third smaller than that of the 42-line Bible; it is considerably more economical and thus marks an important step towards varying as well as cheapening book-production by the careful choice of type""; ""the book contains a colophon which it is difficult to believe to have been written by anybody but the inventor of printing himself"".

Of course Trithemius' Catalogus illustrium viro[rum] germania[m] (1495) might also be considered to be a national bibliography. A later printing of the Summarium exists, dated 1549. The book follows the arrangement of Trithemius.  It was based in part by a 1545 manuscript of John Leland.  Title page woodcut shows Bale presenting the book to Edward VI.  John Bale was the Bishop of Ossory, converted to Protestantism and returned to England only after the accession of Edward VI. His autobiography appears on ff. 242-246.

Breslauer and Morgan copies are in bindings of Thomas Wotton.  The Grolier Club owns Edward VI's dedication copy of this book, which was exhibited by Breslauer and Folter at the Club in 1981.  Bale undertook his antiquarian project to preserve and catalogue the manuscript holdings of those libraries threatened by the dissolution of the monasteries. He often remarked that 'to destroye all without consyderacyon, is and wyll be unto Englande for ever, a moste horryble infamy amonge the grave senyours of other nacyons' 

DNB: Bale was a man of great theological and historical learning, and of an active mind. But he was a coarse and bitter controversialist and awakened equal bitterness amongst his opponents. None of the writers of the reformation time in England equaled Bale in acerbity. He was known as ‘Bilious Bale.’ His controversial spirit was a hindrance to his learning, as he was led away by his prejudices into frequent misstatements. The most important work of Bale was a history of English literature, which first appeared in 1548 under the title ‘Illustrium Majoris Britanniæ Scriptorum Summarium in quinque centurias divisum.’ It is a valuable catalogue of the writings of the authors of Great Britain chronologically arranged. Bale's second exile gave him time to carry on his work till his own day, and two editions were issued in Basel, 1557-1559. This work owes much to the ‘Collectanea’ and ‘Commentarii’ of John Leland, and is disfigured by misrepresentations and inaccuracies. Still its learning is considerable, and it deserves independent consideration, as it was founded on an examination of manuscripts in monastic libraries, many of which have since been lost.

","Yates Thompson/Sokol description: Bale (1495-1563) a former monk and later Protestant bishop of Ossory was in the service of Thomas Cromwell. He began his bibliographical project to record in particular the manuscript holdings threatened by Cromwell’s dissolution of the monasteries. After his patron’s fall Bale fled to Germany, where he sent out bitter diatribes earning himself the nickname ‘bilious Bale’. On the accession of Edward VI he returned to England to share in the triumph of the reformers and publish the works composed in exile. Bale was a very knowledgeable historian of vigorous literary skill and brilliantly expressive, but as a polemicist coarse, offensive and intemperate; this bibliography is by far his most important and enduring work. A ‘Survey of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, that is of England, Wales and Scotland’, contains British authors spanning five centuries, arranged chronologically, partly based on the De viris illustribus of John Leland. Each entry gives a short biography, then a list of the author’s works and the number of books each comprises and last a short description of their contents. It is a model which is still in common use. Beale was an indefatigable collector and worker who personally examined the libraries of many British monasteries before their dispersal, consequently this bibliography contains much information otherwise hopelessly lost. His autograph notebook is preserved in the Selden collection of the Bodleian, Oxford. it contains the material collected for his published catalogues arranged alphabetically and includes the sources of his information. The variant issue with two different dates on t-p and ascribed to different printers on t-p and colophon. For a good discussion of the questions surrounding the printing see W K Sessions, The First Printers at Ipswich, 1984. It is likely that work was published and distributed in England from Ipswich and in Europe from Wesel, but that does not determine its place of printing. The two final gatherings here, ’the Additio’, are not always present. The William Murray of the t-p ex libris is doubtless Sir William Murray of Tullibardine (fl 1583), Comptroller of Scotland, sometime governor of the young King James and one of the major figures of Scottish C16 public life. He was also a zealous promoter of the reformation in his homeland. STC 1296. Besterman I 904-5 “this book was reissued with the additional imprint Wesaliae 1549, both imprints are fictitious”.

The binding is undoubtedly contemporary German work, as decorations have been found in Heidelberg bindings of about this period. The inscription “Edwardus A[n]glo[rum] Rex” was probably added in England before the book was presented to Edward VI, who died at the age of sixteen in 1553 after a reign of only six years.

DNB: Banister or Banester, John 1540-1610, surgeon, was well known among surgeons in London in the latter half of Queen Elizabeth's reign. He began his professional life as surgeon to the forces sent under the Earl of Warwick in 1563 to relieve Havre. On this expedition he and William Clowes [q.v.], another surgical author, began a friendship which lasted throughout their lives. Some time after his return he studied at Oxford, and received a license to practise in 1573. For several years he practised both physic and surgery at Nottingham. Leicester's expedition to the Low Countries in 1585 gave Banister another opportunity of public service, and he served on board ship (Royal Letter, 1593; see Munk). After the expedition he settled in London, and in 1588 he and Clowes are associated in the dedication of Read's ‘Translation of Arceus.’ They saw many cases together, and in 1591 T. P., a patient of theirs, praised both surgeons in a wretched English poem. Complaints were often made at that time to the College of Physicians as to surgeons practising medicine, and, perhaps in consequence of some such difficulty, Banister in 1593 obtained a royal letter of recommendation which led the college to grant him a license (15 Feb. 1593-4) on the condition that in dangerous cases he should call in one of its fellows.

He edited Wecker, with corrections, ‘A Compendious Chyrurgerie gathered and translated (especially) out of Wecker,’ 12mo, London, 1585.  He compiled a collection of remedies and prescriptions, ‘An Antidotarie Chyrurgicall,’ London, 1589, in which he acknowledges the generous help of his contemporaries, George Baker [q.v.], Balthrop, Clowes, and Goodrus. He also published in folio ‘The History of Man, sucked from the Sap of the most approved Anatomists, 9 books, London, 1578.’ Calametius, Tagaltius, and Wecker, three dry and unprofitable writers on surgery, form the basis of his writings. No cases from his own practice are given, and neither domestic history nor interesting examples of style are to be found in his pedantic pages. He lived in Silver Street (Antidotarie), and was buried in the church of St. Olave in that street, since destroyed, with the record of his death, in the great fire. He had a long epitaph in English verse, which bears sufficient resemblance to some poems of Clowes to make it likely that it was written for Banister's tomb by his old friend. In 1633, some time after Banister's death, a collected edition of his surgical works was published, ‘The Workes of that Famous Chyrurgian, Mr. John Banester,’ in six books.

This is now considered to be the second edition after the Cologne edition of 1471. The De proprietatibus rerum was first printed in Cologne by Johann Schilling for William Caxton in about 1471. There were twenty-four editions (in Latin, Dutch, French, English, and Spanish), printed in the fifteenth century. This is the first important encyclopedia written in the Middle Ages and the first to include the works of Greek, Arabian and Jewish naturalists and medical writers. For three hundred years it defined the general knowledge the Latin literate need master. Its nineteen books cover anatomy, musical instruments, astronomy, plants, food, political geography, insects, wine, glass, medicine, form, matter, animals, meteorology, minerals, metals, venom, how to give a dinner party…. Ruppel learned to print with Gutenberg and introduced printing to Basel and Switzerland. None of his sixteen books is dated.

In good condition (final upper margins and first leaves are lightly stained — one quire more so), a large copy with pinholes preserved, a few margins uncut. 

A journeyman of Johannes Gutenberg's called Bechtold of Hanauwe [1] and Berthold Ruppel were probably the same person. As Berthold early as 1468 a Latin Bible ( GW -printed 4207) in Basel, it is believed that he had introduced the printing press there. In the following years Ruppel printed  about 20 to 28 more works that are mainly devoted to theology and canon law. By 1475 Berthold Ruppel was married to a Magdalena, with her ​​he had a daughter. In 1477 Berthold acquired the freedom of the city.  Ruppel was last mentioned as alive on 4 March 1494.. On 12 March 1495 his wife was referred as a widow.  Ulrich Zel was also from Hanau.

He continued his lectures at the claustral school until 1231, when he was sent to Magdeburg in Germany. There he took on the role as the new lector. Nothing definitive is known about the life of Bartholomæus after he left Paris in 1231. His life at Magdeburg was probably spent in teaching and reorganizing the Franciscan school there. The date of Bartholomæus' death is unknown, but it is thought that he died about the middle of the thirteenth century. He was formerly identified with a later Franciscan and Englishman, Bartholomæus of Glanvilla, or Glaunvilla, who died about 1360, and to whom the famous work De Proprietatibus Rerum was ascribed. Recent research places beyond doubt that the two men must be distinguished and that the authorship of the work in question must be attributed to the Magdeburg professor of 1231, and that the Glanville descriptor should be removed from his name.

Edition princeps. Extremely rare. While older authorities give precedence to the Basel edition, printed by Ruppel, it can now be stated that this is the first printed edition of Bartholomæus, since the early manuscript dates found in two Ruppel books have been shown to be forgeries, and as it now seems that Ruppel did not begin printing in Basel until after 1472. 

Besides being the first printed edition, this Cologne issue is important for its connection to William Caxton [see note below]. The Cologne city ledgers record that Caxton arrived in the city in July 1471 (Birch) to learn the process and art of printing. In 1471, Johann Veldener [see note below] chose Bartholomaeus' encyclopedia as his first project, and accepted Caxton as his pupil. However, indications are that Caxton's role was considerably more important as a financier. ""The necessary capital is more likely to have come from Caxton than Veldener who had only recently achieved independence by the establishment of his own printing office and who therefore would have been close to the limits of his financial capacity. Under these circumstances, would he have dared on his own to venture the publication of so large a book? There is the further possibility that Veldener got together the necessary funds by charging the Englishman for instruction in the art of printing"" (Corsten). Thus this edition is the earliest example of Caxton's printing. 

De Proprietatibus Rerum was the most popular encyclopaedia of the thirteenth century, which has been called the age of encyclopaedias. The intellectual renaissance of the preceding century had stimulated a desire for learning. It was impossible for a large number of students to acquire first hand knowledge of every science and the universities could not accommodate all those who wished to learn. Therefore some means of spreading knowledge was required. The problem was solved by writing encyclopaedias that collected together the opinions of the best known authorities. These works varied in comprehensiveness and arrangement, but the educational aim was never forgotten. These books were to be used as textbooks and works of references for the preachers and scholars that did not have access to a library and who could not afford to collect one of their own. In fact, Bartholomæus wrote his compilation primarily for the student of theology and for the preacher as he explains in the Prohemium. 

De Proprietatibus Rerum was written as an ordered encyclopedia of all the sciences of the time: theology, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, chronology, zoology, botany, geography, mineralogy, are the subjects treated in this work. It is the first important encyclopedia written in the Middle Ages and the first in which the works of Greek, Arabian, and Jewish naturalists and medical writers, which had recently been translated from Arabic into Latin, were included as contributions. Aristotle, Hippocrates, Theophrastus, the Jew Isaac Medicus, the Arabian Haly, and other researchers are frequently quoted. Even in the age before mechanical printing, the De Proprietatibus Rerum enjoyed widespread popularity as is shown by the many dozens of manuscripts still in existence. In manuscript form, it was translated into five European languages: French, English, Spanish, Provençal and Italian. Thus, it had a widespread appeal to the general population and had a great influence on the cirriculum of the medieval university. 

Bartholomæus based the structure of his book on the Etymologiarum Libri Duo written by the learned theologian, Isidore of Seville between 623 A.D. and 633 A.D. The 20 sections found in Isidore are reduced and rearranged to 19 by Bartholomæus; however, he follows his own method in compiling the observations and adheres to the accepted medieval form of quoting ancient authorities. Sprinkled throughout the text are his own observations that give the De Proprietatibus Rerum a unique flavor. 

The 19 books of Bartholomæus' text are ordered thusly: (1) God, (2) Angels and Demons, (3) Of the Soul and Reason, (4) Of the Body's Essences, (5) The Human Body and Each of its Parts, (6) The Ages of Man (Family Life and Household Economy), (7) Of Infirmities and Medicines, (8) Of the World and the Heavenly Bodies (Cosmology and Astrology), (9) Of Time and the Divisions of Time, (10) The Material, Form, and Properties of the Elements, (11) Of the Air and its Natural Phenomena (Meteorology), (12) Of Winged Creatures, (13) Of Waters and Fish, (14) Of the Earth and its Features, (15) Of its Provinces (Political and Economic Geography), (16) Mineralogy, including precious and semiprecious stones, sand, coal, Bezoar stones, etc., (17) On Plants and Trees (A Herbal), (18) Of Animals, and (19) On Non-Essential Characteristics (i.e., Colors, Tastes, Odors, etc.), and a Miscellany on Food, Drink, Eggs, Weights and Measures, Music, and Musical Instruments. This ordering which can be classified into four distinct sections suggests that Bartholomæus carefully planned his work. 

The order of the De Proprietatibus Rerum is founded on a medieval logic of progression. The first three books form the first section with God, as the supreme creator and the prime moving force, with angles, demons and the soul all occupying the first position. Next comes the second part (books 4-7) devoted to the important factors that affect the life of man. The third section (books 8-18) treats the universe and may be subdivided into two parts. The first (books 8-13) has as its subject the world in general while the second (books 14-18) describes the earth in particular, including in book 16 metals, stones and minerals. The fourth section is composed solely of the nineteenth book in which everything not previously discussed finds a place including colors, odors, liquids, weighs, measures, music, etc. Since this work was intended as a reference to show mans place in God's universe, the text provides examples of good and bad conduct, and illustrates for him the principals of Christianity. 

Since the greatest importance was assigned to theological matters, it became fairly simple for Bartholomæus to ignore the accuracy of his descriptions. Hence we find him with no clear idea of the locations of Egypt or India, the latter being a vague term which medieval men used to refer to the vast territory that stretched beyond Arabia. Bartholomæus' own eyes would have told him that bees do not carry small stones to weight them against the wind, and that crabs do not employ stones to keep oyster shells propped open while they dine on the contents. It was as obvious then as now that the legs of a fox are not shorter on the right side, and that swiftly moving currents are not the cause of oars becoming disjointed in appearance when dipped under water. Yet we cannot blame him for being a man of his time.

William Caxton. (Born: Tenderton, Kent, England, c1416; Died: London, England, 1491) English printer, translator & linguist. Caxton was the first to print books in English. He served an apprenticeship as a mercer and about 1441 he relocated to Bruges and established a successful business there. In 1462 Caxton was selected governor of the Merchants Adventurers in the Low Countries, serving as a diplomat for the English king. He learned the art of printing in Cologne between 1471-2, and at Brugge in 1475 he and Colard Mansion printed The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye, his own translation from the French, and the first book printed in English. In 1476 he returned to England, and established the first English print shop at Westminster in 1477. There he printed Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophres, the first dated book printed in England. Caxton is known to have printed about 100 books, many dealing with themes of chivalry. He was the translator, from French, Latin, and Dutch, of about one third of the books that he printed, and for some he wrote original prologues, epilogues, and additions. His books are of superb craftsmanship and are carefully edited. One of the typefaces used by Caxton is the original Old English type. Wynkyn de Worde, his successor as a printer, was his assistant at Westminster.

Johann Veldener. (Born:      ; Died: c1487) Dutch printer. Native of the Diocese of Würzburg, Veldener set up his first press in the town of Louvain in 1473. In 1478, he moved to Ultrecht and reestablished his print shop there.

First editions Caxton 1472, ca. 1471 or 1479 [Basel. Berthold Ruppel]; First dated edition 1480. Strasbourg.

The first important encyclopedia of all the sciences of the Middle Ages, which by its wide dissemination over three centuries, had a profound influence on medieval thought. It is ""still important for its information on political geography and its accounts of natural history"" (Stillwell). Divided into nineteen books, the contents are as follows: ""(1) God; (2) angels and demons; (3) psychology; (4–5) physiology; (6) family life, domestic economy; (7) medicine; (8) cosmology, astrology; (9) time divisions; (10) form and matter, elements; (11) air, meteorology; (12) flying creatures; (13) waters and fishes, dolphins, whales; (14) physical geography; (15) political geography, (in 175 chapters; this contains a number of interesting remarks, notes on economic geography, etc.); (16) gems, minerals, metals; (17) trees and herbs; (18) animals; (19) color, odor, savor; food and drink, eggs; weights and measures; musical instruments"" (Sarton, II, p. 586). ""Book 16 contains 104 short chapters on as many mineral substances as earths, stone, ores, metals, salts, etc., as well as gemstones, the latter often given names that now defy identification of the materials concerned. Gemstones are alabaster, adamante, amethyst, agate, alabandina, beryl, carbuncle, chrysoprase, chalcedony, chrysolite, rock crystal, coral carnelian, hematite, heliotrope, jet, jasper, hyacinth, pearl, marble, onyx, opal, prase, sapphire, emerald, sard, sardonyx, topaz, turquoise; very brief descriptions with comments on curious or medicinal lore associated with each"" (Sinkankas, Gemology, p. 70).The first English edition was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1495.  The next English edition was by Berthelet in 1535.  Both editions were the translation of John Trevisa.

De Proprietatibus Rerum was the most popular encyclopaedia of the thirteenth century, which has been called the age of encyclopaedias. The intellectual renaissance of the preceding century had stimulated a desire for learning. It was impossible for a large number of students to acquire first hand knowledge of every science and the universities could not accommodate all those who wished to learn. Therefore some means of spreading knowledge was required. The problem was solved by writing encyclopaedias that collected together the opinions of the best known authorities. These works varied in comprehensiveness and arrangement, but the educational aim was never forgotten. These books were to be used as textbooks and works of references for the preachers and scholars that did not have access to a library and who could not afford to collect one of their own. In fact, Bartholomæus wrote his compilation primarily for the student of theology and for the preacher as he explains in the Prohemium. 

De Proprietatibus Rerum was written as an ordered encyclopedia of all the sciences of the time: theology, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, chronology, zoology, botany, geography, mineralogy, are the subjects treated in this work. It is the first important encyclopedia written in the Middle Ages and the first in which the works of Greek, Arabian, and Jewish naturalists and medical writers, which had recently been translated from Arabic into Latin, were included as contributions. Aristotle, Hippocrates, Theophrastus, the Jew Isaac Medicus, the Arabian Haly, and other researchers are frequently quoted. Even in the age before mechanical printing, the De Proprietatibus Rerum enjoyed widespread popularity as is shown by the many dozens of manuscripts still in existence. In manuscript form, it was translated into five European languages: French, English, Spanish, Provençal and Italian. Thus, it had a widespread appeal to the general population and had a great influence on the cirriculum of the medieval university. 

Bartholomæus based the structure of his book on the Etymologiarum Libri Duo written by the learned theologian, Isidore of Seville between 623 A.D. and 633 A.D. The 20 sections found in Isidore are reduced and rearranged to 19 by Bartholomæus; however, he follows his own method in compiling the observations and adheres to the accepted medieval form of quoting ancient authorities. Sprinkled throughout the text are his own observations that give the De Proprietatibus Rerum a unique flavor. 

The 19 books of Bartholomæus' text are ordered thusly: (1) God, (2) Angels and Demons, (3) Of the Soul and Reason, (4) Of the Body's Essences, (5) The Human Body and Each of its Parts, (6) The Ages of Man (Family Life and Household Economy), (7) Of Infirmities and Medicines, (8) Of the World and the Heavenly Bodies (Cosmology and Astrology), (9) Of Time and the Divisions of Time, (10) The Material, Form, and Properties of the Elements, (11) Of the Air and its Natural Phenomena (Meteorology), (12) Of Winged Creatures, (13) Of Waters and Fish, (14) Of the Earth and its Features, (15) Of its Provinces (Political and Economic Geography), (16) Mineralogy, including precious and semiprecious stones, sand, coal, Bezoar stones, etc., (17) On Plants and Trees (A Herbal), (18) Of Animals, and (19) On Non-Essential Characteristics (i.e., Colors, Tastes, Odors, etc.), and a Miscellany on Food, Drink, Eggs, Weights and Measures, Music, and Musical Instruments. This ordering which can be classified into four distinct sections suggests that Bartholomæus carefully planned his work. 

The order of the De Proprietatibus Rerum is founded on a medieval logic of progression. The first three books form the first section with God, as the supreme creator and the prime moving force, with angles, demons and the soul all occupying the first position. Next comes the second part (books 4-7) devoted to the important factors that affect the life of man. The third section (books 8-18) treats the universe and may be subdivided into two parts. The first (books 8-13) has as its subject the world in general while the second (books 14-18) describes the earth in particular, including in book 16 metals, stones and minerals. The fourth section is composed solely of the nineteenth book in which everything not previously discussed finds a place including colors, odors, liquids, weighs, measures, music, etc. Since this work was intended as a reference to show mans place in God's universe, the text provides examples of good and bad conduct, and illustrates for him the principals of Christianity. 

Since the greatest importance was assigned to theological matters, it became fairly simple for Bartholomæus to ignore the accuracy of his descriptions. Hence we find him with no clear idea of the locations of Egypt or India, the latter being a vague term which medieval men used to refer to the vast territory that stretched beyond Arabia. Bartholomæus' own eyes would have told him that bees do not carry small stones to weight them against the wind, and that crabs do not employ stones to keep oyster shells propped open while they dine on the contents. It was as obvious then as now that the legs of a fox are not shorter on the right side, and that swiftly moving currents are not the cause of oars becoming disjointed in appearance when dipped under water. Yet we cannot blame him for being a man of his time.

This is the second illustrated edition of Bartholomaeus’s work, preceded only by the French printing of Matthias Huss in Lyon (1482). The eleven full-page woodcuts in our book are original to this edition and independent from the French cuts. They are famous for the naturalistic liveliness, especially the plates of Books XII-XVIII showing birds, fish, plants and animals. A remarkably lifelike elephant even suggests he might have been studied by nature. The illustrations also include one of the earliest pure landscapes in printing (see Snyder, p. 55 and 59). At the end is Bellaert’s woodcut device within a four-piece floriated woodcut border with animals and birds (Juchhoff 37).  This is the only work printed bt Bellaert in which his name appears.  He prinyed from 1483 to 1486.
The illustrations – including the device – are attributed to Conway’s ‘Haarlem Woodcutter’, who is also called the ‘Bellaert Master’, as his works appeared at first in printings of Jacob Bellaert. After Bellaert ceased to operate his press in 1486, the master worked for Gerard Leeu in Antwerp. He is considered one of the best woodcut designers of the late 15th-century Netherlands, and, due to his painterly style, he has been connected to the workshops of panel painters as the Master of the Tiburtine Sibyl (cf. W.R. Valentiner, in: The Art Quarterly VI (1943), p. 74/91) or the Monogrammist AM (cf. Vroege Hollanders. Schilderkunst van de late middeleeuwen, exhib. cat. Rotterdam 2008, p. 126)

Jacob Bellaert (born in Zierikzee) was an early Dutch publisher who produced seventeen books in Haarlem from 1483 to 1486. The early Netherlandish painter Master of Bellaert or Master of Jacob Bellaert is so called for his many woodcuts in Bellaert's publications.","Emtinck II: 264.105; Rega Phil F30; Cordeys 1760: 1404; La Vallière 67: 1734 (colored, ""imperf"" in ms); Cobenzl 558; Verdussen I: 303.30a; La Vallière 83: 1471; Bolongaro-Crevenna 1585; Thott VII: Q1095; Ermens 2692; Bonn F104*; Hultman 84; Coppenole 3079; Roy 1373; Kloss 512; Heber V: 1978; Hulthem 3610,31061; Lammens I: 55; Borluut 5445; Enschedé 879 (colored); Scott 1905: 793; Hoe I A-K: 1497 (1st three woodcuts mounted, lacks 1 leaf of text and two blanks); Corput 1505 (manque quelques feuillets); Wolff 73;

Harper 1973: $5500.  Contemporary calf over wooden boards with 2 clasps. Decorated with rolls of frames with portraits, inscriptions and ornaments; letters PEGAW on center panel of front cover.    Like Tagliacozzi, Bartisch produced one of the 16th century  works that established a surgical subspecialty.  Like other German surgeons such as Brunschwig, Gersdorff & Stromayr, Bartisch wrote in German and illustrated his book with actual cases.  A large part of its success is due to the many full page woodcuts that show not only the specific surgical procedures and instruments but also the style of dress of patients and surgeons and the conduct of surgical procedures.  Many of the plates appear to be individual portraits.  The woodcuts are by Hans Hewamaul after Bartisch's own drawings.  The use of superimposed flaps began with the fugitive leaves of Jobst de Negker, Hans Guldenmund, Heinrich Vogtherr and Gianantonio de Nicolinis de Sabio.  These all were based on pre-Vesalian anatomy.  Vesalius provided instructions for cutting out illustrations and superimposing them as flaps.  Leonhard Thurneisser in 1576 used a number of anatomical plates with super- imposed flaps for which Hewamaul also cut the woodblocks. Bartisch gives the first illustration of the brain and eye with superimposed  flaps.  Colored copies exist in Putti Collection, Duke University, Karolinska and the State Library of Dresden as well as the copy Mickey Carton bought from Jörn Günther.  The first three have identical coloring.  Günther offered a colored copy at NY Book Fair 2009 for $350,000 (to Micky Carton).  All copies seem to have similar coloration.  A second issue with a new title page was published in 1584.

It was also the first work to establish a subspeciality within the domain of surgery, establishing the term “ophthalmology”. “The book’s text, in twelve parts, and its woodcut illustrations combine to give a comprehensive view of Renaissance eye surgery. The woodcuts constitute one of the most remarkable features of the publication: they total ninety-one, including some repetitions, and they are believed to have been executed by Hans Hewamaul after Bartisch’s own drawings. Two of the illustrations are presented with overlays showing anatomical parts lying successively one under the other; Bartisch was the first to illustrate the brain and the eye in this manner. The book was printed at Bartisch’s own expense and was widely used for the next century” (Daniel M. Albert and Eugene Flamm in the Grolier One Hundred). These striking illustrations show the anatomy and diseases of the eye, surgical operations, instruments, distilling apparatus, etc. They are crowded with detail, and form a comprehensive picture book of practical methods of treatment. Bartisch was court oculist to the Elector of of Dresden and the founder of modern ophthalmology. He was a skilful operator, and developed many instruments. He was renowned for his cataract operations, and was the first to practise the extirpation of the bulbus in cancer of the eye.

First edition of an important and rare book. The writing of ""Consilia,"" or medical case-books, was a salient feature of clinical medicine in the 14th and 15th centuries. They consisted of clinical records and letters of advice written by prominent physicians. These Consilia ""run over the patient's physical condition and disease, winding up with seasonable advice as to what to eat, what drugs to take and what things to avoid. Being personal histories, they have not the classic flavor of the clinical delineations of Hippocrates and Aretaeus...[they] are of interest...as showing that physicians had already begun to keep careful records of their daily practice.""¬Garrison, History of Medicine, p. 167. 
Baviera (d. 1480), was physician to Pope Nicolas V and professor of medicine, logic, philosophy, and morals at the University of Bologna. He was one of the most eminent teachers of the Bologna medical faculty and his Consilia were widely regarded and reprinted several times. They are an interesting collection of practical pathology and epidemiology, each amounting to an exhaustive study of a particular case, its symptoms, causes, and treatment. Some of the most important deal with caries of the temporal bone, paralysis with aphasia, and iron in chlorosis. Other consilia are concerned with women's diseases; sterility; venereal diseases; leprosy; plague; diseases of the eye, the stomach and connected organs; and tooth-ache. 
Good large copy of a very scarce book. From Stonyhurst College with their stamp on first leaf. Stonyhurst College is a coeducational Roman Catholic independent school, adhering to the Jesuit tradition,[2][3] on the Stonyhurst Estate, Lancashire, England. It occupies a Grade I listed building.[4] The school has been fully co-educational since 1999.

The college was founded in 1593[5] by Father Robert Persons SJ at St Omer,[6] at a time when penal laws prohibited Catholic education in England. After moving to Bruges in 1762 and Liège in 1773, the college moved to Stonyhurst in 1794.[5][6] It provides boarding and day education to approximately 450 boys and girls aged 13–18.[7] On an adjacent site, its preparatory school, St Mary's Hall, provides education for boys and girls aged 3–13.[8]

The school combines an academic curriculum with extra-curricular pursuits.[9] Roman Catholicism plays a central role in college life, with emphasis on both prayer and service, according to the Jesuit philosophy.[10]

As usual for this period the bat is included as a bird.  Many woodcuts are signed with a black arrow, a white cross on a black diamond or the cross of Lorraine often associated with Geoffrey Tory.  The only artist that Belon mentions in his letter to the reader is Pierre Goudet (Gourdelle).  Firmin-Didot 4: 221b suggests that the initial letters are by Jean Cousin. Belon's comparison of the skeleton of a bird with that of a human in Book 1 establishes him as the originator of comparative anatomy.  The work is divided into seven parts: the first on the anatomy and physiology of birds; the second on birds of prey; the third on swimming birds; the fourth on coastal birds; the fifth on galliformes; the sixth on crows and similar species; and the seventh on songbirds. The second part also includes a chapter on falconry.  All seven books have separate title pages with the printer's device colored  The work is dedicated to Henry [sic] II.  The edition was published by Gilles Corrozet and Guillaume Cavellat; copies have either imprint and printer's device on title pages. Norman Catalogue shows both issues on p. 64.  Blind stamp on title: Boston Society of Natural History.  According to Bayle & Thillaye, Belon was murdered.  The coloring is from a workshop judging by the similarity with the Otto Schaefer copy.  Le portrait de Belon à l'âge de 36 ans, que l'on trouve au verso du titre et sept figures d'oiseaux sont attribués à Geoffroy Tory par Auguste Bernard dans son ouvrage Geoffroy Tory Peintre et graveur, premier imprimeur royal, Paris, 1865.

The first and only old edition of this highly important ornithological work. It is the first French ornithology book. The cost of publishing this first edition was shared by two Parisian publishers: Guillaume Cavellet and Gilles Corrozet who had the book printed by Benoist Prevost. There are therefore two issues of this first edition, but with neither taking precedence: the present copy was published by Cavellat. 
Pierre Belon du Mans (ca. 1518-1564) studied medicine in Paris, where he took the degree of doctor before becoming a pupil of the brilliant botanist Valerius Cordus at Wittenberg, with whom he travelled throughout Germany. Cordus died of malaria in Italy in 1544, and Belon, on his return to France, came under the patronage of François, Cardinal de Tournon. De Tournon provided him with the means which allowed Belon in 1546 to undertake a wide ranging journey, apparently of scientific intent. He travelled through Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, Arabia and Palestine, returning to Paris in 1549, where a full account of the journey was published in 1553. Besides the narrative of his travels he wrote several scientific works of considerable value. Belon was highly favoured both by King Henry II and Charles IX. 
Perhaps taking his working methods from his former mentor Cordus, Belon published the Histoire naturelle des estranges poissons in 1551, followed by De arboribus coniferis and De aquatilibus in 1553, and then the present work in 1555. In this work Belon attempted to match the names of birds used by Aristotle and Pliny with those then current in France; he was also one of the pioneers of comparative anatomy, illustrating and describing the homologies of human and avian skeletons, and re-grouping birds according to their anatomy in the following books: (2) 'La nature des oyseaux vivants de rapine, tant de iour que de nuict'; (3) 'La nature des oyseaux vivants le long des rivieres, ayants le pied plat, nommez en latin Palmipedes aues'; (4) 'La nature des oyseaux de riviere, qui n'ont le pied plat'; (5) 'La nature des oyseaux de campagne, qui font leurs nids sur terre'; (6) 'La nature des oyseaux qui habitent indifferemment en touts lieux, & se paissent de toutes sortes de viandes'; and (7) 'La nature des oysillons, qui hantent les hayes, buschettes, & buissons'.
L'Histoire de la nature des oyseaux was also one of the first ornithological compendiums to be based, at least in part, on field observations, and it is also clear that many of the woodcut bird portraits were taken from actual specimens. Belon acknowledges the work of Pierre Goudet (= Gourdel(le) in the preface, but evidently a number of other artists cut the blocks: the cuts are variously signed with an arrow, a Lorraine cross, or a white cross in a black lozenge; the remainder are unsigned. Jean-Pierre Mariette confirms in his Abecedario (p. 324, de Nobele editeur) that Pierre Gourdel(le) (1530-after 1588) has drawn almost all the birds. Many of the original drawings were auctioned in June 2006 by Bergé in Paris.
On the verso of the title is the portrait of Belon with a quotation and sonnet by Guillaume Aubert (1534-1597), directed to King Henry II of France to whom the book is dedicated by Belon (pp. 3-4), dated Paris, 'en l'Abbaye S. Germain', 12 January 1554. After the preface on pp. 5-7, follow the contents (pp. 8-12), Index (pp. 13-25), the privilege, dated 14 January 1554 (p. 26-27), and laudatory poems by Nicolas Denisot (1515-59), Jean Vezou and Desiré Jaquot de Vandoeuvre.

La discipline avait été quelque peu à la traîne par rapport à la botanique, par exemple. Mais la zoologie devait être renouvelée par le rôle fondamental que jouaient désormais l'observation directe et le souci d'une illustration captée sur le vif. Portrait de Pierre Belon et 160 bois délicatement gravés, d'après les dessins de Pierre Gourdelle. Les dessins originaux du peintre parisien étaient l'un des fleurons de l'opulent cabinet de Pierre Berès, récemment dispersé (Livres du Cabinet de Pierre Berès, 2003, n° 8). Premier écrivain scientifique en langue française, Pierre Belon (1517-1564) « à la fois géologue, botaniste, zoologiste, s'intéressa aux poissons et aux oiseaux, voyagea dans toute l'Europe et le Moyen Orient. Il en résulte une oeuvre où l'observation occupe, peut-être pour la première fois, une place prépondérante. On y trouve référence aux anciens textes mais avec une distance critique, des rectifications d'erreurs et des essais de nouvelles classifications » (Tous les savoirs du monde, encyclopédies et bibliothèques, de Sumer au XXIe siècle, BN, 1996, n° 23). En français dans le texte. L'ouvrage s'inscrit dans les combats pour la langue française qui connurent une grande vogue au XVIe siècle, notamment dans le domaine scientifique. Comme Ambroise Paré qui écrivit directement en français pour être entendu des barbiers chirurgiens, Belon se justifie dans son épître liminaire au roi : « j'ay entreprins vous faire voir à part en sept livres, ce qu'ay trouvée es oyseaux digne de récit, l'ayant rendu en nostre langue, presque en mesme ordre & sentence de ce que (dieu aidant) vous présenteray en Latin (...). J'ay aproprié les mots françoys chascun à son naïf portraict, afin de le représenter à vos yeux : veu mesmement qu'onc homme (que l'on puisse sçavoir) ne les a publiez en ceste façon. »   « Le livre second, qui est consacré aux oiseaux de rapine contient des chapitres intéressants sur la fauconnerie »). ? En français dans le texte, n° 52 : « Des nombreux livres publiés par Belon, l'Histoire de la nature des oyseaux est sans doute le plus accompli : cet ouvrage, le premier rédigé en français qui soit exclusivement consacré aux oiseaux, marque une étape importante dans l'histoire de la zoologie. Belon y témoigne d'une grande érudition mais aussi d'un louable esprit critique, alors peu fréquent. ».- Pinon, Livres de zoologie de la Renaissance, 1995, n° 91.- Mortimer-Harvard, French 16th Century Books, n° 50 : « Belon's text, as one of the first of its time to be based on direct observation and original drawings, is a major work in the field of natural history ».- Thiébaud, Bibliographie sur la chasse, 1934, p. 66.-13151;","Belon, Pierre1555-1.jpg","Belon, Pierre1555-2.jpg",cid:6625FCF2-100D-4FCC-ADB5-08F9FF28A459@nyc.rr.com,"Belon, Pierre1555-3.jpg","Belon, Pierre1555-4.jpg",C1,30000,30000,,,545500,395709

Both editions are oblong octavos. All the woodcuts are in contemporary color.  Along with Estienne and Paré, Belon presented scientific work in French.  This work is preceded by Belon's L'histoire naturelle des estranges poissons marins...Paris: 1551 which is a quarto of 58 leaves.  It is this work that marks the revival of research into animal and comparative anatomy.  The first French edition of this work by the famous French naturalist Pierre Belon (1517-1564), printed by Charles Estienne (1504-1564), son of Henri I and brother of Robert Estienne.  Charles became  ""imprimeur du Roi"" in 1551. The work contains descriptions of a dolphin, a seal, a salamander, a turtle, a seahorse, all sorts of fishes, shells, etc., and it is illustrated with beautiful woodcuts, depicting also some imaginary animals.  For the present work, the author was probably inspired by the animals he saw on his journey from 1546 to 1550 to Greece, the Greek Islands, Alexandria, Lower Egypt, Judea, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, and back to Rome. The fish he describes include some rare species from the Mediterranean area. The Latin edition was published by Estienne in 1553.  The work was republished in Zurich in 1558.  According to Bayle & Thillaye, Belon was murdered because of Protestant beliefs.
This copy was bound for James II (1633-1701) during his exile in France after 1688.  These books are usually bound in soft red morocco, here with crowns on the spine.  On the front and back boards are the arms of Pondre de Guermantes (1650-1723) a later owner.  The coloring is from a workshop judging by the similarity with the Otto Schaefer copy.

Without the initials ""JB"" (Jean Blondelet) on rear paste down, but from his collection","Belon (1517- 1564), was a Renaissance scientist and based his work on true observation, rectifying what Aristotle, Appianus, Pliny and other classical authors had written. He divided aquatic animals into two divisions, those provided with blood and those without, corresponding to the modern taxa: Vertebrata and Invertebrata. They were classified according to size, differences in the structure of the skeleton, mode of reproduction, number of limbs, body form and on the physical characteristics of the habitat (Pietsch, 1995). There are drawings of 110 species of fish. Nearly all the marine fishes are Mediterranean but there are also species of the Atlantic region obtained from the Paris market. Marine mammals, crabs, lobsters, shellfish, oysters and cockles are depicted as well. Other descriptions and drawings refer, however, to fabulous animals like the horse of Neptune, the sea monk and the sea eagle. The existence of these animals was not clearly denied by Belon. The fact that they were illustrated was enough to validate the stories which gave birth to them, and many later books reproduced them unaltered (Dance, 1978). The woodcuts are attributed to the Paris painter Pierre Gourdelle.

D’une extrême rareté, cette édition décrite par Brunet (I-761), est la toute première des trois parues cette
année 1555 : « Il existe, dit-on, trois éditions de cette traduction, faites à Paris sous la même date, et
offrant entre elles des différences notables. Nous avons donné le titre de la première, voici celui de
chacune des deux autres : 1/ De la nature et diversité des poissons avec leurs descriptions et naïfs
pourtraicts, en 7 livres, in-folio. – 2/ Histoire des poissons, traitant de leur nature et propriétez, aves
les pourtraicts d’iceux, in-4 (en françois et en latin) : je n’ai vu que l’édition in-8 et l’in-4 ; cette
dernière est un volume composé de 20 ff. prél., et 448 pp., avec 184 􀂿 g. en bois impr. avec le texte. »
Cette troisième édition de 1555 cote, selon Brunet, le double de l’édition latine de 1553 décrite ci-après.
Une édition avait originellement paru en 1551 sous le titre L’Histoire naturelle des estranges poissons
marins, illustrée de 21 bois, puis une édition augmentée de plusieurs 􀂿 gures (1553), publiée cette fois
en latin sous le titre De Aquatilibus libri duo.
OUVRAGE TRÈS RECHERCHÉ POUR LA QUALITÉ DE SES BOIS, LES PRÉCIEUSES REMARQUES QUI LES
ACCOMPAGNENT ET POUR LA PERSONNALITÉ DE PIERRE BELON DU MANS (1517-1564), APOTHICAIRE DU
CARDINAL DE TOURNON, GRAND VOYAGEUR ET NATURALISTE.
IL CONTIENT 186 FIGURES GRAVÉES SUR BOIS, DONT CELLES DES MONSTRES MARINS ET DU FAMEUX
« Pourtraict de la teste d’un Saulmon femelle ». On attribue l’illustration à Pierre Gourdelle, qui a
également réalisé celle de l’Histoire de la nature des oiseaux, publiée la même année par Pierre Belon.
Cet ouvrage est, avec celui de Rondelet, LE PREMIER TRAITÉ D’ICHTYOLOGIE SCIENTIFIQUE, apportant
d’authentiques observations qui ne soient empruntées à Aristote ou à Pline. Véritable pionnier
en embryologie, Belon relance les études sur la structure anatomique des poissons, et défend la
représentation réaliste des animaux à des 􀂿 ns d’enseignement et d’identi􀂿 cation. On retrouve cependant,
tout comme dans l’ouvrage de Rondelet paru à la même époque, la représentation de monstres marins,
dont celle, fameuse, d’un monstre qui a l’aspect d’un moine.
BELON PROPOSE UNE CLASSIFICATION DES ANIMAUX AQUATIQUES, qui inclut les poissons à proprement
parler, mais aussi les mammifères, dont les cétacés, les céphalopodes, les coquillages, les crustacés.
Bien qu’il décrive environ 110 espèces de poissons, on trouve aussi dans cet ouvrage des représentations
de baleine, d’otarie, d’hippopotame, ainsi que des crustacés, une anémone et même un caméléon !
PIERRE BELON DÉCRIT DANS CET OUVRAGE, POUR LA PREMIÈRE FOIS EN EUROPE, DE NOMBREUX ANIMAUX
QUI Y ÉTAIENT INCONNUS JUSQU’ALORS.
Sa classi􀂿 cation est réputée meilleure que celle de Guillaume Rondelet, et mieux observée ; en
appuyant sa classi􀂿 cation sur l’anatomie des organes thoraciques et abdominaux, Belon ouvrait une
nouvelle voie à la science.

N° 10 - « Grand voyageur, ethnologue, ichtyologiste, ornithologiste, botaniste, Belon est un de ceux qui
rénovèrent, par l’observation directe et sur place, l’étude des sciences naturelles, réduites avant lui
aux gloses érudites des textes anciens. Belon a donné à toutes ses recherches une portée pratique,
perfectionné l’acclimatation végétale, introduit en France des essences exotiques. En􀂿 n, IL A TENTÉ DE
SUBSTITUER LA LANGUE FRANÇAISE AU LATIN, COMME LANGUE SCIENTIFIQUE. L’examen des données
chronologiques et topographiques qu’il fournit lui-même sur ses déplacements continuels, à la lumière
de l’histoire diplomatique des règnes de François 1er et d’Henri II, persuade que le naturaliste cachait
une activité d’agent secret derrière sa profession. Il est en Angleterre et en Allemagne en 1540-1541
- époque marquée par les différents projets de mariage de Charles d’Orléans avec Anne d’Autriche ;
encore en Allemagne et à Luxembourg en 1543; en Orient entre 1546 et 1548 - on connaît les
manoeuvres des Valois auprès de Soliman ; de nouveau en Angleterre et à Rouen en 1550 - année de la
reddition de Boulogne ; à Metz après 1553, à Thionville en 1556 ; il est témoin oculaire des événements
de la première guerre de Religion - il faisait partie de la faction catholique. »
CETTE ÉDITION PRINCEPS EST RARISSIME ET Brun (Le Livre Français illustré de la Renaissance, p. 119) NE
CONNAÎT QUE LA TROISIÈME ÉDITION DE 1555 QU’IL DÉCRIT AINSI : « 180 bois délicatement gravés dont un,
p. 33, représente un monstre marin ayant l’aspect d’un moine dont s’est inspiré l’illustrateur du ‘Recueil de
la diversité des habitz en 1562’. » Ce monstre marin est présent dans cette édition princeps de 1555.

The bishop of Le Mans, René du Bellay, immediately adopted Belon's ideas for his gardens at Tourvoye.  Pierre Richer de Belleval, inspired by Belon, established the Jardin des Plantes at Montpellier in 1593, even before Paris had one. Charles de l'Escluse (Carolus Clusius) recognized Belon's authority in natural history. Clusius translated this work into Latin in 1589 to make it available to those unable to read French. Like most of Belon's books, this was published by Cavellat and Corrozet; there are copies with each imprint. The woodcut portrait of Belon at age 36 had already appeared in Belon's L'Histoire de la Nature des Oyseaux, 1555.  It is attributed to Geoffroy Tory by Auguste Bernard in his work on Tory (1865).  The title page is signed by Gesner: C. Gesnerii ex dono authoris, a very plausible presentation copy.   Belon stayed with Gesner in 1557 while working on Historia Animalium liber iiii (de Piscium). Belon contributed greatly to the progress of natural sciences in the sixteenth century and was the originator of comparative anatomy. In La nature et diversité des poissons, Paris 1551, he presented an orderly classification of fish. He set forth the first notions of embryology, and also classified birds. Belon's knowledge was not derived solely from books; he was one of the first explorer-naturalists. Between 1546 and 1550 he undertook long journeys through Greece, Asia, Judaea, Egypt, Arabia, and other foreign countries. Belon was very interested in the plants and trees he observed during his voyages, especially in their practical use, more than in their scientific description. According to Bayle & Thillaye, Belon was murdered because of Protestant leanings. The title page is mounted on a stub.  The washing of the book has eliminated the annotations, presumably by Gesner.

He studied medicine at Paris, where he took the degree of doctor, and then became a pupil of the botanist Valerius Cordus (1515-1544) at Wittenberg, with whom he traveled in Germany.

On his return to France he was taken under the patronage of Cardinal de Tournon, who furnished him with means for undertaking an extensive scientific journey. Starting in 1546, he traveled through Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, Arabia and Palestine, and returned in 1549. A full account of his travels, with illustrations, was published in 1553.
Belon, who was highly favored both by Henry II and by Charles IX, was assassinated in Paris one evening in April 1564, when coming through the Bois de Boulogne.
Besides the narrative of his travels he wrote several scientific works of considerable value, particularly the Histoire naturelle des estranges poissons (1551), De aquatilibus (1553), and L'Histoire de la nature des oyseaux (1555), which entitle him to be regarded as one of the first workers in the science of comparative anatomy.

1589 Latin edition: First Latin edition of this interesting treatise on exotic trees useful to be introduced into France by the French naturalist Pierre Belon (1517-1564). The original French edition was published at Paris, 1558: Les remonstrances sur le default du labour et culture des plantes, et de la connoissance d'icelles, contenant la maniere d'affranchir et apprivoiser les arbres sauvages. Belon contributed greatly to the progress of natural sciences in the sixteenth century and was the originator of comparative anatomy: in La nature et diversite des poissons, published at Paris, 1551, he presented an orderly classification of fish. He set forth the first notions of embryology, and also classified birds. Belon's knowledge was not derived solely from books, he was one of the first explorer-naturalists, and between 1546 and 1550 he undertook long journeys through Greece, Asia, Judaea, Egypt, Arabia, and other foreign countries. Belon was very interested in the plants and trees he observed during his voyages, especially in their practical use, more than in their scientific description. In the present work, his last one, Belon lists a large number of exotic trees useful to be introduced into France, inviting moreover the College of Medicine in Paris to constitute a garden for the acclimatization of exotic plants. The bishop of Le Mans, Rene du Bellay, immediately adopted Belon's ideas for his gardens at Tourvoye, and Pierre Richer de Belleval, inspired by Belon, established the Jardin des Plantes at Montpellier in 1593, even before Paris had one. Belon was an analyst devoted to detail, and his observations were generally correct. He was already famous during his lifetime, and had the confidence of the great, who recognized his authority, like Charles de l'Escluse (Carolus Clusius), who translated this work into Latin to make it available to those unable to read French. This edition is issued without privilege or approbatio, perhaps because L'Ecluse was rather suspect in the eyes of many government officials. His Exoticorum libri decem, Leiden, 1605, includes a reprint of the present work.

He also describes the seating arrangements and roles for different participants in the dissection.  Although the colophon indicates MDII, the introduction is dated MVID and the dedication to the Emperor Maximilian is dated MIIID.  Is it possible that the imprint date of MDII is a misprint for MIID?  Lind, Studies in Pre-Vesalian Anatomy   pp.  69-137, discusses a possible earlier edition.

Benedetti includes a list of Greek and Latin authors that he cites; this is an early example of a work with a bibliography.  There is an extensive index.  A separate section on the brain includes a discussion of 7 pairs of cranial nerves.  Benedetti established the first anatomical theater in Padua and served as physician to Emperor Maximilian.  This is one of the earliest works to reintroduce classical nomenclature for anatomical structures for which derivations from Arab writers were usually used.  The first chapter describes the arrangement of a public anatomy in a temporary dissection theater.  (English translation in Lind). See also Baldassar Heseler's description of Vesalius' First Public Anatomy.

As far as the possibility of this being an incunable with a misprinted date, Bernardinus Guerraldus is listed as having worked from 1502-1528, first in Venice and then in Ancona.

Very rare first edition of the most important treatise on anatomy prior to Vesalius’s discovers: “undoubtedly the most eminent work of the pre-vesalian period” (Haeser).
Alessandro Benedetti (ca 1445 - 1525) studied under Antonio Benivieni, the founder of anatomical pathology. In 1490, Benedetti built the anatomical theatre in Padua and was the first to point out the necessity of human cadaveric dissection and to make claim for the benefits of employing corpses of non-executed people. He taught in Padua and acted as the physician to the Venetian army during the war against the king of France, Charles VIII. On that occasion, he was entrusted by the Venetian Senate with writing an account, which was to be printed by Aldus Manutius in 1496 as “Diaria de bello Carolino”. Interestingly, Benedetti’s Historia corporis provides extensive information on the newly-established Sicilian medical school, which spe- cialised in plastic surgery anticipating procedures and methodology developed by Tagliacozzi a hundred years later.

“Alexander Benedictus was a medical professor, much interested in anatomy, who had effective command of Greek obtained during residence in the Levant. By about 1490 he was demonstrating anatomy in Padua, where he had a special building for the purpose.  His Anatomice was printed at Venice in 1502 and several times afterwards.  Its significance for us is that it passes the Latino-Arabic lightly and goes direct to he Greek of Galen with Benedictus must have studies in manuscripts.  After Mundinus it is the first work entirely devoted to anatomy, and he is certainly the first anatomist after Valla to draw terms from Pollux. It is likely that Vesalius had read the book of Benedictus before he left Paris, since a student’s edition had been issued there in 1514 by Henri Estienne” (Charles Singer, A Prelude to Modern Science).

This is the first work on pathology based on post-mortem examinations.  Recorded here are the results of twenty postmortems and hundreds of unusual cases describing gallstones, urinary calculi, cancer of the stomach, fibrous tumor of the heart, peritonitis arising from intestinal perforation, and Siamese twins. Benivieni was also the first to observe and describes here the superficial manifestations of syphilis and its transmission to the foetus. There are several important sections treating pathology in his descriptions of surgical procedures; therefore, this work is as valuable to the history of surgery as it is for early pathology.  While not as detailed as dissections by Morgagni, it is one of the earliest attempts to reach conclusions from direct observations. 
Benivieni (1443-1502) was an eminent Renaissance physician and surgeon to the most important families in Florence, a few of which include Machiavelli, Poliziano, Ficino, Lorenzo de' Medici, and his friend Leonardo da Vinci. His original conception of De abditis (on the several hidden and strange causes of disease and cure) was a work of 300 cases; unfortunately he only lived to complete one hundred sixty of these. His brother Girolamo, with the help of physician Giovanni Rosati, edited and had the work printed containing the one hundred eleven parts as it is seen here.  The work is noted in Poccianti, Gallus and Spach.  Malgaigne has a section on Benivieni in the introduction to Paré. 1: cxii-cxx.

""Antonio Benivieni was a friend and colleague of several of his distinguished contemporaries, including Angelo Poliziano, Marsilio Ficino, Benedetto Varchi, and Lorenzo de'Medici; during his thirty years of medical practice he attended the most important families in Florence. However, his fame today rests on the posthumous De abditis, edited by his brother, the poet Girolamo Benivieni, and the physician Giovanni Rosati. The title of the book, which translates as 'on the several hidden and strange causes of disease and cure,' reflects the author's interest in ascertaining, via postmortem examination, the reasons for death in cases where diagnosis during life had been obscured... De abditis was derived from the large number of manuscript records that Benivieni left behind him at his death. The work was originally conceived as a treatise of 300 sections to be published in three series or centuriae; however, Benivieni completed only 160 sections, and of these the editors selected 111"" (Grolier Medicine 12).

First detailed illustration of neurosurgical instruments.
The work was based on the treatment of a head wound sustained by Lorenzo de Medici (Duke of Urbino), the father of Catherine de Medici whose husband, Henri II, was the subject of Paré's work on Head Injuries.  The woodcut on the title page appeared in an earlier publication of de Benedictis: Alessandro Achillini & Augustinus de Ancona: Opusculum perutile de Cognitione Animae et eius Potentiis Augustini de Anchona Cum Quadam Questione Prosperi de Regio, 1503.  Berengario was a native of Ferrara and professor of anatomy at Bologna from 1502-1522.  He may have been the immediate predecessor of Vesalius at Padua.  An English translation by L.R. Lind was published in 1990.  
RCPE: The first separate treatise on head wounds, and their surgical treatment. Describes several types of skull fractures. Also discusses apoplexy, meningitis and paralysis. 
The work originated in a dispute between Berengario and some other physicians over the treatment of Lorenzo de Medici, who had suffered a skull fracture. Berengario described several types of skull fractures and grouped the resulting lesions according to their symptoms, drawing from his own observations, as well as contemporary medical knowledge, to cite the relation between location and neurological effect.
""He also discussed prognosis, diagnosis and treatment, described the technique of craniotomy and provided detailed illustrations of contemporary neurosurgical instruments. The title illustration is a typical representation of the medieval cell doctrine, which localized mental functions in the ventricles or ""cells"" of the brain."" (Norman).

""Berengario's book was the most original neurological treatise until then and was not surpassed until the appearance of Ambroise Paré's similar work in 1562, in which Paré expressed his appreciation of his predecessor's efforts and made use of them."" DSB.

Berengario described several types of skull fractures and grouped the resulting lesions according to their symptoms, drawing from his own observations, as well as contemporary medical knowledge, to cite the relation between location and neurological effect. He also discussed prognosis, diagnosis and treatment, described the technique of craniotomy and provided detailed illustrations of contemporary neurosurgical instruments. The title illustration is a typical representation of the medieval cell doctrine, which localized mental functions in the ventricles or ‘cells’ of the brain” (Norman). “The Tractatus was written in little more than two months, soon after Berengario’s return to Bologna, and dedicated to Lorenzo de’ Medici. It opens with a short discussion of various sorts of skull fractures, followed by a grouping of the consequent lesions according to their symptoms. This is the most interesting and valuable portion of the work, for Berengario was able to cite from contemporary knowledge or from his own direct observation the relationship between the location of the lesions and the resulting neurological effects. Next, he discusses prognosis, diagnosis, treatment, the instruments to be employed, and the technique of craniotomy. Berengario’s book was the most original neurosurgical treatise until then and was not surpassed until the appearance of Ambroise Paré’s similar work in 1562, in which Paré expressed his appreciation of his predecessor’s efforts and made use of them” (DSB). “Berengario da Carpi was one of the most famous physicians of the 16th century, a recognized master of anatomy and surgery, an emblematic ‘Renaissance man’ who combined his medical experience and engineering knowledge to design new surgical instruments, and effectively used the arts of writing and drawing to describe state-of-the-art medicine and provide illustrations of anatomical structures. His greatest contribution to medicine was to write the most important work on craniocerebral surgery of the 16th century, the Tractatus de Fractura Calvae sive Cranei (‘Treatise on Fractures of the Calvaria or Cranium’), in which he described an entire set of surgical instruments to be used for cranial operations to treat head traumas that became a reference for later generations of physicians. This was a systematic treatise covering the mechanisms, classification, and medical and surgical treatment of head traumas, and can be considered a milestone in the history of neurotraumatology” (Di Ieva et al.). ABPC/RBH lists four complete copies.

“In modern terms, we would say that the Treatise on Fractures of the Calvaria or Cranium deals with the physiopathology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of head injuries. It is essentially based on Berengario’s personal experience, although it is presented as a true textbook complete with the most learned references and controversies, and cites many classic and medieval writers such as Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, Galen, Paul of Aegina, Cicero, Virgil, Seneca, Celsus, Avicenna, Abulcasis, Lanfranc, and many others. The book is divided into two parts: the first describes the causes of head injuries and proposes a classification system that is intended to be useful in everyday practice, whereas the second concentrates on symptoms, prognostic data, and treatment.

“According to Berengario, the ‘broken continuity of the head’ has intrinsic and extrinsic causes, with the latter divided into three distinct types: cutting objects (incision, according to Celsus’ definition), contusing objects, and perforating objects. In proposing his classification, Berengario discusses many classic references (Avicenna, Haly Abbas, Celsus) and adds a number of examples based on his own personal experience …

“A number of his ‘case reports’ include many observations deduced from patients who died as a result of head traumas, and he also very accurately described subdural and epidural hematomas, contrecoup lesions, and subdural empyema.

“One chapter is dedicated to describing the signs of a cranial lesion, which may also occur without bone fracture (brain concussion): redness of the eyes, bilious vomiting, loss of speech, impaired vision, vertigo, fever, vomiting, falling down, and ‘stupor of mind.’ In the presence of these signs, Berengario suggested careful inspection and palpation because, as in the case of capillary fractures, the bone is folded or depressed inwards and ruptured in contact with the dura mater, but not toward the pericranium in the presence of intact skin. The description of the signs occurring in patients following concussion is very exhaustive, and some distinction is made concerning the neurological signs observed depending on whether the membranes (meninges) are intact or lesioned. It is interesting to note that Berengario wrote that a meningeal lesion causes persistent head pain and ‘quite active vomiting of bile’ because of a possible ‘transfer of pain from the brain to the stomach by means of prominent descending nerves.’ Eye redness was explained on the grounds of the anatomical connection between the tunic of the eyes and the membranes of the brain.

“At a time when only two meningeal layers were recognized, Berengario rightly noted that injury of the ‘pia mater’ could be much more serious than that of the dura mater, and that some patients may be affected by ‘spasms’ (seizures) and paralysis on the contralateral side. Apoplexy occurred because the pus stopped in the brain ventricles, in the same way as ‘the pain of the heart produces syncope.’ Following a systematic review of the signs related to epidural or subdural injuries, Berengario spoke about his experience of the possibility of intra- parenchymal damage with symptoms similar to those associated with an injury to the pia mater.

“Head injuries could also cause deficits of the ‘seven’ pairs of cranial nerves (according to Galen; the current classification of 12 pairs was proposed by Soemmering in 1778). Fever could be due to ‘bloody pus descending through the pores of the cranium above or upon the membranes.’ Throughout the history of medicine, the treatment of pus abscesses has been considered particularly important, and Berengario dedicated a whole chapter to what he rightly considered to be the main cause of ‘corruption and putrefaction of organs,’ and the main cause of death.

“He also pointed out that head injuries should be treated as soon as possible (if possible, within the first hour) so as not to “prolong the illness” and, especially, because patients ‘had little sensation’ to surgery in that critical time. At a time when surgery was performed on awake patients, it was important to treat wounds aggressively and immediately because ‘once the patient is dead no assistance will be of value.’ A skin incision was considered the basic step for exposing the fracture, and trepanning, chiselling, and extracting bone fragments.

“Berengario always cited anatomical references and his own dissections to explain the mechanisms of head traumas and the most appropriate way to treat fractures. He makes a long disquisition on the adherence of the dura mater to the internal tabula of the cranium, which includes examples to show that the dura does not adhere more strongly at the sutures (as had been suggested by many previous physicians); on the basis of his dissections of fetal cadavers, he rightly argued that this may be related to age. Among other explanations of subdural hematomas, Berengario did not correctly evaluate the mechanical properties of the blood separating the dura from the endocranium because he believed that a process of putrefaction was necessary to weaken and erode the ‘ligaments’ attaching the bone to the membranes; in his opinion, this separation also explained the change in color that sometimes affects traumatized cranial vault bones.

“Concerning the prognosis of patients affected by head traumas, Berengario suggested a series of advances, including the fact that ‘Physicians should be cautious in making a prognosis of lesion of the head because even a minor lesion can cause apprehension, first, because it occurs in the noblest member of the body and because we have seen many similar cases become dangerous.’ He prophetically considered that ‘good surgeons as well as good physicians are rare. O good gods, how many physicians and what kinds of physicians there are to be found!’ In further polemic confirmation of this phrase, he quoted Hippocrates: ‘Many call themselves surgeons but few really are surgeons.’

“Among other prognostic factors, Berengario gave much importance to the pulse and facial expressions, and there is little doubt that he recognized anisocoria (‘… one eye appears less large that the other’) as a dangerous or fatal sign.

“By this point, the treatise is already and almost incredibly a highly systematic handbook in the most modern sense, but its most original part is the section dedicated to the treatment of head injuries and the necessary instruments for treatment.

“Berengario described the most widely used unguents and potions in vogue at the time for the treatment of skin wounds. He was very meticulous in describing medicines (egg yolk, chicken fat, rose oil, herbal concoctions, if possible prepared during the year of use to reduce the risk of harm) and bandages, because he shared the view expressed by Lanfranc of Milan approximately two centuries earlier that more patients were likely to be cured by medicine than by trepanning. Certainly, the most striking unguent he described is mumia, a mixture of dried human flesh to be applied to a wound continuously for 8 days, and he also revealed the secret ingredients of the potion successfully used by his father for many years, a wax unguent made of turpentine, malmsey wine, pine resin, white wax, mumia, human breast milk, and a number of distinct herbs.

“Special attention was given to convalescence and nutrition during convalescence, with a series of suggestions considered fundamental for the process of recovery (ranging from the quality of the air in different Italian towns to the position to take in bed, and from diet to sexual behavior). Like previous authors, Berengario banned coitus, which was considered very harmful to people with head lesions because ‘the humors are agitated and set in motion toward the upper part of the body and can cause abscess’ and ‘coitus makes the humors ebullient and sets them into motion, crushes, suffocates, and weakens bodily force, is harmful to the stomach and its connection with the head, renders the entire body cold, weak, and bloodless’ (it was believed at the time that sperm came from the veins around the ears through the mediation of the brain).

“It is worth noting that Berengario gave so many suggestions to his students because ‘a physician is not a carpenter but works with the human body; he does not work with stone or leather … If imperfect handling occurs in a human being the individual is destroyed and cannot ever be restored.’ He also took care of a patient’s ‘psychological’ status by suggesting the need to avoid anger, fear, sadness, and fury to ensure a full recovery.

“When introducing the surgical part of the book, Berengario talks about the ‘manual operation … as the difficult, great, and almost horrendous … the ultimate instrument of medicine.’ After discussing the timing of surgery, describing further case histories, and providing some technical notes about the amount of bone to be removed, Berengario meticulously characterizes the surgical instruments required. Berengario believed that the instruments used to trepan and treat the skull injury of Lorenzo de’ Medici were wrong and that he was restored to health ‘with the assistance of the grace of God and medical skill.’ It is not known whether Berengario actually invented any instrument, but he encouraged the use of those that already existed and possibly made some suggestions and improvements. In particular, he provided the first didactic description, illustrated by some very clear and useful drawings, of the complete corpus instrumentorum that every ‘neurosurgeon’ should have. These were categorized into trepanning and perforating devices, elevators, extractors, and chisels, and illustrated in a sort of catalog that specified the exact terminology to be used for each.

“For the first time in the medical literature, he shows a drill consisting of a rotating handle (vestibulum or verticulum), a mobile wooden ball to be held in the surgeon’s left hand (pila rotuna mobilis), a mobile crank for transferring circular movement (cannula mobilis), and drill bits for cutting and rasping (terebra). It is very interesting to note the introduction of interchangeable cranial drill bits and a ‘brace’ (receptacle) or ‘mother of the other tools because it receives into itself others for trepanning,’ thus making it the ancestor of the modern instrument. The terebra had different shapes and sizes based on specific anatomical and traumatological considerations, and it is striking to see how similar some of them are to those used in modern neurotraumatology.

“The terebrum canulatum designed by Berengario had a circular toothed crown with a central pin (aculeus) to engage the bone more easily, and two lateral cutting wings (alae). After penetrating more than half of the bone thickness, another instrument without an aculeus could be used to avoid puncturing the dura. Berengario thus distinguished a masculine version with, and a feminine version without the cutting pin at the end, to be used in different anatomical situations or on the basis of the experience of the surgeon. All of these bits were used to perforate the bone and reach the meninges, but another instrument previously described in classic texts (particularly by the ‘Prince’ Avicenna) was called the terebellum or trepanum non profundans, and was designed to go less deeply into the interior surface of the bone, thus more safely avoiding any penetration of the dura mater and/or brain.

“Two different forceps are also illustrated: one for cutting bone (very useful for completing a craniotomy quickly) and the other, called the tenalia or serpentina, ‘for seizing and extracting arrows, spearheads, thorns, bones, and such extraneous objects which have become lodged in the head or elsewhere.’ The elevatorium magnum and elevatorium parvum are two differently sized instruments with different shapes that were used to lift skull fragments and cut bones. The need to penetrate fracture lines was satisfied by four rasps (ras patoria or scalpra), of which the scalpellus ‘is ideal when the bones are stony hard and into which other tools cannot penetrate because of the narrow orifice of the wound, especially when the physician does not intend to perforate the bone completely.’

“Another instrument he described was the lenticulare or lentiticium, much praised by Galen, ‘which is also struck by a lead hammer [Maleus plumbeus] so as to produce less noise thanks to which the brain of the patient is less disturbed’ (although cotton or wool was used to plug the patient’s ears and reduce the noise). This was considered a very useful means of leveling the roughness of the bones and avoiding membrane injury.

“In addition to describing the manufacture of these tools, Berengario pointed out that they should be extremely sharp and made of Indian iron ‘in order to cut easily without disturbing the brain of the patient.’ In line with some of the principles still used in neurosurgery, Berengario confirmed Abulcasis’ suggestion to operate in two different ways: to treat the fractures directly by gently removing bone fragments, or to perforate all around the fracture to perform a kind of perilesional craniotomy. Finally, he suggested which instruments should be used depending on the type of fracture, and also recommended the use of at least two assistants, not only to help the surgeon, but also to hold the patient down.

“Berengario is often pedantic in describing surgical techniques and quoting references because (citing Seneca and Galen) he believed that ‘a repeated discussion is helpful because it is more easily committed to memory.’ During surgery, cauterization was performed by means of manual compression and the application of ‘egg and coagulating powders’ (the use of ligatures was not suggested until some decades later by Ambroise Parè). Post-operative care (changing medications and dressings, and checking that no pus was retained) was considered very important for surgical success; however, patients were to be advised to confess ‘their sins to God … since the illness is often produced by reason of those sins’” (Di Ieva et al.).

Scarce first edition, the ""starting point of the new anatomy"", as it was the first work since Galen to contain a significant amount of anatomical information derived from the author's own experience and observation. A commentary on the 14th-century anatomical text of Mondino de' Luzzi, who had reintroduced human dissection into anatomy, the work contains numerous observations by Berengario himself based on his own dissections. It also includes the first references to the vermiform appendix, the thymus gland, and the sphenoid sinus, as well as Berengario's denial of the presence of the rete mirabile, a structure described by Galen and found in some animals but not humans (ccccclix r-v) The head and brain are covered on ll. CCCCIIv-CCCCLIXv

Lind points out that Berengario's surname was actually Barigazzi as noted in his will.  The name Berengario does not appear in any of his works published during his lifetime.  After receiving some tutoring from Aldus Manutius who was tutor to the children of Lionello Pio, Prince of Carpi, he took a medical degree at Bologna where he studied under Gabriele Zerbi and Alessandro Achillini.

The plate of the brain is a transaxial view at the level of the atrium of the lateral ventricles.  It is probably the first illustration of the brain from an actual dissection. Other than the marginal illustrations on Schott's fugitive leaf in Gersdorff, this is the first non-schematic illustration of the brain.  This work in its abridged form of Berengario's commentary on Mundinus of 1521 can be compared to the Epitome of Vesalius. Berengario followed Mondino but added original descriptions of the sphenoid sinus, the pineal gland, the tympanum, the valves of the heart, the lateral ventricles and the choroid plexus.

1. Decorative woodcut borders have been added to the plates of the Commentaria
2. The plates of the heart D7v, D8r and D8v and brain G8r are new to the 1523 edition. Another plate new to the 1523 edition is the seated muscle figure on I4r.  
 
3. Other differences between the 1521 and 1523 works are the illustrations of the vertebrae, and the figures of the uterus. 
 
I have always thought that the Commentaria and Isagogae are analogous to the Fabrica & Epitome.  Also the use of full page illustrations set in a landscape background in Berengario must have been a model for Vesalius.  Interestingly the female figure C7v also can be considered a model for Estienne's illustrations.

 The second edition of Beregario's Isagogae added three more anatomical woodcuts, as well as some revisions to the illustrations that had appeared in the first edition. ""These alterations and additions emphasize the anatomy of the heart and brain, and include THE FIRST PUBLISHED VIEW OF THE CEREBRAL VENTRICLES FROM AN ACTUAL DISSECTION."" (Norman, 189). The architectural title-border was first used in Berengario's Commentaria (1521). Here it has been altered to read ""Maria"" instead of ""Leo P.X.,"" and Berengario's surname ""Carpus"" appears both in the architrave and the vignette. The shield has also been altered to read ""YHS."" Berengario's woodcut illustrations of muscle men posed before a landscape background, while lacking in detail in comparison to those in Vesalius's Fabrica, make a bold and aesthetically graphic statement, and represent the model on which Vesalius based his series of larger and more scientifically portrayed muscle men. ""There are six dramatic woodcuts of men standing four square with their legs apart. The muscles are indicated by lines representing in a diagrammatic way the direction of the muscles fibers.

Berengario, who taught anatomy and surgery at Bologna from 1507, was the first anatomist to publish treatises on anatomy based on his own dissections. Between 1521 and 1523 he issued a series of three works illustrated with woodcuts which were the first works since Galen--over a thousand years earlier--to display any considerable amount of original anatomical information based upon personal investigation and observation. Berengario's first original anatomical work was a commentary, over 1000 pages long (528 leaves) and illustrated with a woodcut title-page and 21 full-page anatomical woodcuts, on the Anatomia of Mondino, a fourteenth-century dissection manual. He followed that work one year later with a condensation entitled Isagoge Brevis republishing the some of the same woodcuts. This was a practical manual of dissection consisting of 72 leaves. One year later Berengario produced this revised and expanded second edition of 80 leaves with additional woodcuts--his last and definitive contribution to anatomy. The second edition of Beregario's Isagogae added three more anatomical woodcuts, as well as some revisions to the illustrations that had appeared in the first edition; these alterations and additions emphasize the anatomy of the heart and brain, and include THE FIRST PUBLISHED VIEW OF THE CEREBRAL VENTRICLES FROM AN ACTUAL DISSECTION. The architectural title-border was first used in Berengario's Commentaria (1521) Here it has been altered to read ""Maria"" instead of ""Leo P.X.,"" and Berengario's surname ""Carpus"" appears both in the architrave and the vignette. The shield has also been altered to read ""YHS.""

Berengario's woodcut illustrations of muscle men posed before a landscape background, while lacking in detail in comparison to those in Vesalius's Fabrica, make a bold and aesthetically graphic statement, and represent the model on which Vesalius based his series of larger and more scientifically portrayed muscle men. ""There are six dramatic woodcuts of men standing four square with their legs apart... The muscles are indicated by lines representing in a diagrammatic way the direction of the muscles fibers. In all but one the figures show us their own dissected parts by holding skin and muscle flaps away. All stand in a sketched-in landscape with a few hillocks and a few grass tufts or weeds. The second plate is the most dramatic; behind the gesturing man are bold rays of light in a dark sky--technically and aesthetically a fine woodcut."" (Roberts & Tomlinson p. 71) Berengario was also the first to begin to incorporate into anatomical woodcuts some of the theatrical props that Vesalius' images would later make more famous. For example, one of Berengario's muscle men stands holding a rope, by which cadavers were typically suspended for muscle study. The rope was also a reminder that anatomists typically studied the bodies of criminals who had been executed by hanging as their bodies were better preserved than those who had been executed in a more intrusive manner.

The title-page of Berengario's Commentaria with its small illustration of a dissection scene in the lower margin, may have suggested to Vesalius the idea for the dramatic and famous frontispiece to the Fabrica. Vesalius also borrowed from Berengario the concept of having particular anatomical figures perform specific actions, and repeated Berengario's trick of showing a skeleton holding a skull in each hand as a means of illustrating three separate views of the skull in one woodcut. An art collector and patron who, according to Vasari, once accepted a Raphael painting of St. John in the Desert as a fee for medical attendance, it is probable that Berengario saw some of Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical drawings, as Leonardo's artistic techniques of depicting anatomical parts from different perspectives were incorporated in some of his woodcuts. It is also likely that Berengario would have hired a fine artist to prepare the woodcuts for his books. Some of the woodcuts have been attributed to the Italian Mannerist painter and sculptor Amico Aspertini (ca 1475-1552). For the attribution to Aspertini see Cazort, Kornell, Roberts, The Ingenious Machine of Nature: Four Centuries of Art and Anatomy (1996) 38-39. Choulant-Frank, pp. 136-142; Herrlinger, pp. 80-83; Harvard/Mortimer Italian, p. 12; Norman 189; Putti, Berengario da Carpi, pp. 150-154; Roberts & Tomlinson pp. 70-83; Sappol, Dream Anatomy, pp.90-91.

Gaskel-Pagel description of 1522 edition: This famous work introduced several innovations in anatomy and anatomical illustration and is among the most important precursors of Vesalius. ‘Berengario was the author of the first [anatomical] illustrations made from nature. His innate feeling for the graphic arts seems to have aided him considerably in his first attempts’ (Choulant p. 138). Several of Berengario’s illustrations, such as those of the veins on f. 67r, show the influence of Leonardo (Herlinger p. 83). This set of anatomical illustrations is by far the most extensive that had appeared up to this time.
The male skeleton and muscle figures are displayed against landscape backgrounds in the way that would be followed by Estienne and Vesalius. The female figures are equally striking and, in contrast to the male figures, are revealed in bedrooms, or holding sheets (or shrouds?) behind themselves. Both the situation and the poses of the figures giving them an erotic charge; they are modelled on works of art and inspired Estienne’s female figures, but not those of Vesalius. As Talvacchia remarks ‘artistic conventions for the display of the eroticized female body shared those developed for the demonstration of female sexual organs’ (Talvacchia pp. 169–170). The last five woodcuts seem to have been intended for artists.
The Isagogae breves is a condensed version of Berengario’s Commentaria on Mondino’s anatomy (1521) and uses many of the same woodcuts, but with significant revisions and additions. The Commentaria was printed at Bologna by Girolamo de Benedetto whom Choulant suggests may have cut the blocks. Three of the woodcuts which Choulant says were intended for artists are omitted, but the illustration of two uteri on f. 25r is new, as is the muscleman on f.69r. The second edition, printed in the following year, added three more anatomical woodcuts and revisions to other woodcuts.
Garrison–Morton notes that this work includes a description of the valves of the heart and Pagel discusses Berengario’s views on the disputed septum of the heart in the Commentaria (William Harvey’s Biological Ideas, p. 159). Though he does not mention the Isagogae specifically he would no doubt have been interested in what Berengario says here about the veins and the heart.
Berengario was born in Carpi, near Modena, the son of a surgeon. He took his MD at Bologna and taught surgery first at Pavia, then at Bologna. After 1527 he was in Ferrara and Rome where he was the first to use mercury in the
treatment of syphilis and thereby earned a large fortune. He was regarded by Benvenuto Cellini as ‘a great connoisseur in the arts of design’ (quoted by Choulant, p. 136).

Only in the middle of the 16th century; with the reawakening of anatomy based on direct observation as advocated by Berengario and Vesalius was there a glimmer of new innovative approaches to what might be considered neurosurgical procedures.... In 1518 the anatomist and surgeon Berengario da Carpi published the first 'modern' work on head injuries.  Berengario had participated in 1517 in the care of Lorenzo de Medici, who sustained an occipital skull fracture from a gunshot wound. Because of the successful outcome, Berengario wrote his work ' Tractatus de fractura...'. 

In addition to the treatment of Lorenzo, the overall management of head injuries is described. He also includes a description of the surgical treatment by using gravity to facilitate drainage of an abscess that resulted from a laceration of the brain. Berengario stressed that the surgeon must have appropriate instruments before beginning an operation of the brain. ... This work was the first to illustrate neurosurgical instruments. Many of these instruments appear in other books of the 16th and 17th centuries and are quite similar to those used today. The woodcuts on the title pages of the two 16th century editions of Berengario's book illustrate both the theoretical and the practical aspects of surgery during this time. The cut from the first edition of 1518 is a cartoon of the medieval concepts of localization of functions in the ventricles rather than in the brain substance itself.

Bernard of Gordon (c.1258-1318) of Scottish descent but born in France, was a professor at Montpellier from 1283 to 1307. He spent his entire teaching career at Montpellier and contributed greatly to the university's fame as the outstanding medical school in Europe. He completed the Lilium in 1305. In the Dark Ages (476-1000), European medicine was entirely in the hands of the Jewish and Arabian physicians when the founding of the medical school at Salerno in the eleventh century began to breathe new life into medicine. The Lilium preserves the Arabic tradition, but also contains much original material, and is one of the works which laid the foundations of medical literature in the fourteenth century, from the schools of Montpellier, Paris, Bologna and Padua. It contains, inter alia, the first description of a modern truss, the first mention of spectacles (oculus berellinus), and the suggestion that muscles move due to a mechanical action of the nerves. Modern studies have been made of Bernard's treatises on epilepsy, marasmus, smallpox, and urology. The Lilium was translated in the Middle Ages into French, German, Hebrew, Irish, French and Spanish, but never into English, although Bernard is mentioned in the prologue to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Demaitre says of Bernard (p. 169): ""It would be difficult to find a more worthy representatives of Montpellier?s claim to fame, of the academic tradition, and of the medical profession around 1300 than Bernard of Gordon.""",Fuiren p. 5; Fourcroy 1213 (this copy); Kloss 1948*; Wolters 343;,Provenance: Fourcroy copy; Bookplate of Kenneth Rapoport. ,,Bernard of Gordon1487-1.jpg,Bernard of Gordon1487-2.jpg,"

«Bernardus de Gordonio completed the Lilium medicinae in 1303–1305 following twenty years of teaching medicine at the University of Montpellier in France.

Dedication of the author to Paulus Sidlovitium Polonum. Some slight and sporadic browning along the lower edge of a few papers but an example in more than good general condition. (Editio Princeps) First rare edition of both these works by the illustrious Bolognese humanist. In the first, the author gives life to a debate between three brothers (the first, a philosopher, the second, a doctor and the third, an orator) to settle a controversy over their father's will. The parent in fact establishes that his inheritance goes to the child who carries out the most useful profession for society. The three to get the paternal patrimony strenuously defend their activities but it is obviously the speaker who gets the inheritance because, even if his profession is probably the least useful, he is the best at defending it. In fact, the orator exposes the errors of the philosopher and the doctor drawing on sources such as Pythagoras, Empedocles, Plato, Hippocrates, Galen and Avicenna. The second work, from card B2, is an epistle on the art of governing and the optimal form of government. Beroaldo begins ""De optimo statu"" with a description of the different regimes considered legitimate, speaking of ""status popularis"", ""status paucarum"" and even ""status unius"" when referring to the monarchy, then reaching the same conclusions as Campano. The best state, he argues, can only be achieved if our sovereign or our chief magistrate remains oblivious to his own good and is sure to act in everything in such a way as to promote only public welfare. Filippo Beroaldo the Elder was a famous Italian humanist pupil of Francesco dal Pozzo. At the age of 19 he opened his own school in Bologna, later becoming a professor of rhetoric and poetry in 1472. In 1476 he went to Paris, where his lessons in classical texts attracted a large audience. In 1479 he returned to Bologna where he remained a very successful teacher until his death. Prolific teacher and successful writer, Beroaldo was known for his editions of classical authors such as Plautus, Cicero, Suetonius, but above all he is famous for his commentary on Apuleius's Golden Ass. He has also published a series of important treatises-orations on moral and social issues, among which these two works are among the best known and cited.","Heinsius Litt Q312 (1505); Bigot Q2276 (?ed); Imperiali p. 64; Charron-Ménars Q2219 (Opuscula 15000; Hohendorf Q1912 (Oratationes 1509); Petaviana 1722: F1933 (1500); Mencke 1727: p. 802 (Opuscula 1517); Ludewig 12894 (Opuscula 1509); Salthenius 868 (Opuscula 1517); Feuerlein 1288b (Opuscula 1517); La Vallière 83: 3161 (1558 French); Pinelli 3633 = Pinelli 1789: 8533; Laire II: 223; Thott VII: 2393; Caillard 1694 (Orationes 1502); Roxburghe 2299 (1501); MacCarthy-Reagh 3548 (1501); Roscoe  655-663; Hibbert 1017 (1508 Opera); Courtois 2916 (Orationes 1497); Boutourlin 1831: Inc 575; Heber I: 740; Heber III: 545 (1517 Opuscula Basel); Heber V: 502 (1508 Opuscula); Kloss 635 (1501),636 (1515); Millon 1961 (Opuscula 1508); Gardner 1854: 189 (Opuscula 1497); Libri 1861: 984; Sunderland 1254 (Orationes 1505); Eugène Piot II: 1652 (Orationes 1500); Manzoni 3688; Dunn 1902 (Opuscula 1507); Wolff 472 (ff. 40); Pottesman 1979: 68 (1501 Paris);",,"Peter and Margarethe Braune (Christie's: The Open Book: Fine Travel, Americana, Literature and History in Print and Manuscript Online|2 - 18 June 2020

BEROALDUS, Philippus (1453-1505). Declamatio philosophi, medici, oratoris. –. De optimo statu et principe. Bologna: Benedictus Hectoris, 13 December 1497.

A rare incunable on the fallacies of traditional sciences, particularly physics and medicine; the first edition of these two essays by the preeminent Bolognese scholar. The first essay is a dispute between three brothers—a philosopher, a physician and an orator—about the worth of their respective professions. The orator wins the contest: what he does is less useful than his brothers’ occupations, but he is better able to defend his own position, exposing the philosopher's and the physician's fallacies by citing ancient authorities. The second work addresses statecraft as the optimal form of government; having reviewed the governments of the many, the few, and of a single person, Beroaldus gives his preference to the latter—provided the ruler is bound by loyalty to public good as opposed to private gain.

First edition to be edited by Joannes Kaiser of Bertucci’s principal work, first printed in Lyon in 1509 and again in 1518. It “comprises the following sections: De regimine sanitatis; De aegretudinibus particularibus; De febribus; De crisi et de diebus creticis; De venenis; De decoratione. According to Sarton, it contains also a chapter on anatomy including a description of the brain” (Stillwell). This chapter appears on f. XII, and the following chapters are on the diseases of the brain. According to Hirsch and others the author’s name is Bertucci, but it is spelled Bertrucci in this book. He was a pupil of Mondino, continuing his practice of dissecting cadavers in the classroom, and the teacher of Guy de Chauliac, who makes frequent mention of him. He died in Bologna in about 1342. He is one of five anatomists between Mondino and the beginning of the sixteenth century to be listed by Baas (Outlines of the history of medicine, p. 297), the others being Petrus de Argelata, Montagnana, Achilini, and Gabriel de Zerbis. Stillwell, The awakening interest in science, III, 313 and IV, 602 (1509 edition).

Though Bertuccio's life remains undocumented, his work has left a permanent mark on the study of medicine. Bertuccio was an authority in surgery, but in practice he preferred nonsurgical procedures. His most notable writing was a systematic collection of diseases and treatments. For each ailment he discussed etiologic factors, gave the rational and empirical treatment, described the symptoms, and provided his prognosis for recovery. There is one chapter on anatomy which includes a description of the brain. Apoplexia is covered in Chapter IX f. XXXV.",Fuiren p. 51 (1518); Broeckhuysen Med Q91; Fr.

","Among the members of the von Nostitz family one of the most important with regards to art collecting was count Otto von Nostitz (1608-1664), who purchased a palace in Lobris in 1654. His passion was inherited by his son, count Christoph Wenzel von Nostitz (1643-1712), who in March 1682 commissioned from Michael Willmann a series of paintings for the palace chapel and a canvas depicting the rescue of Andromeda. Both counts contributed to creating a collection of prints as well.  Duration of this collection in Silesia: after 1654 - 1945

19th century inventories of the palace mention over 200 paintings as well as numerous prints and aplied arts items. A key element of the interior decoration was the gallery of antecedents part of which has been preserved until today in the form of over 50 medallions decorating the ceiling of the representative room. Aside of the portrait gallery, the family's power was also confirmed by numerous paintings with the landscapes of its estates, palaces and castles. The highlights of the collection in Lobris were many paintings by Michael Willmann, including the famous ""Andromeda"". From Büsching's account it is known that the core part of the collection was exhibited in a planned way in a spacious room, and that each painting was accompanied by a number referring to a catalogue note. The Nostitzes owned an impressive collection of old prints and etchings as well.Nostotz is between Dresden and Wroclaw (Breslau)","Bertruccio, Niccolo [Bertucci]1537-1.jpg","Bertruccio, Niccolo [Bertucci]1537-2.jpg","

An Italian edition was published first in 1568 and 1569 in Lyons, and it was Bizzarri himself which translated it into Latin in order to reach a larger public. The dedication at the beginning is adressed to the 13 years old August of Saxony, son of Prince Elector August. It is dated January 1573 and gives the young man a brief account of the history of writing and of historiography. The Turkish war in Hungary (pp. 1-165) is followed by an account of the unrest in the Netherlands in 1566 and of other contemporary European occurrences (pp. 166-332). On p. 284 is the earliest published account of the death of Vesalius.  The somewhat longer account in the 1568 Italian edition of this work is translated by O'Malley on pp. 309-310 of his biography of Vesalius.  The present single imprint of Bizzari's ""Pannonicum bellum"" was one month later compiled in a collective edition together with the Latin translation ""Aula Turcicae"" of Antoine Geuffroy s ""Briefve description de la cour du grand Turc"" and with the ""Belli Cyprij inter Venetos et Zelymum Turcarum Imp."" as well by Bizzarri.

Contains descriptions of the Turkish War in Hungary 1564-68, siege of Malta, including conquests of the French in Florida and Canada. First edition with this title. 
Pietro Bizzarri (1525–1586) was an Italian historian and spy. Bizzarri was born at Sassoferrato in Umbria; or, according to some writers, at Perugia, and so is sometimes called Petrus Perusius. When young he went to Venice, but having become a Protestant he left for Germany, in 1545. After the Battle of Mühlberg (1547) he moved on to England, where he spent periods his life. On 4 July 1549 Bizzarri was admitted a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, by the royal commissioners for the visitation of the university, being incorporated there ad eundem; and Francis Russell became his patron. The accession of Queen Mary saw him leave England; he returned on the accession of Elizabeth I. Bishop John Jewel, prompted by Archbishop Matthew Parker, gave Bizzari the prebend of Alton Pancras in Salisbury Cathedral. This followed the presentation to the queen of his De principe tractatus.[1][2] Meanwhile Russell had become governor of Berwick. Bizzarri went north with him. He presented Mary, Queen of Scots with a different treatise, and shortly went abroad. Not receiving further church preferment, Bizzarri began to travel. He obtained, in 1570, a license from William Cecil to go abroad, to print his own works, and gather news of foreign affairs for the government. He passed some time at Genoa; in Germany he obtained, through the influence of Hubert Languet, employment with the Elector of Saxony. On 20 October 1573 he addressed from Augsburg a letter in Italian to Cecil, now Lord Burghley. He went on to Antwerp, where he met the scholarly circle around Christopher Plantin. In 1581 he asked Justus Lipsius in Leyden to find a publisher of his ""Universal History"" in eight volumes. He was back in Antwerp in December 1583; on 23 November 1586 he addressed a Latin letter from The Hague to Burghley.",Barberini I: 156; de Thou II: 410; Heinsius Hist O302; Fr.

By 1572 Bizzarri was traveling throughout Europe, staying in Basel, Augsburg, Venice, and finally Antwerp where he settled.  In Antwerp he acted as a foreign agent for members of Queen Elizabeth’s government, occasionally sending reports back to England.","Bizzarri, Pietro [Bizarus, Petrus]                              1573-1.jpg","Bizzarri, Pietro [Bizarus, Petrus]                              1573-2.jpg","1. avelibro OHG (Dinkelscherben, Germany)

Première édition d’Antoine Vérard. Elle est magnifiquement illustrée par 10 grands bois gravés. C’est une traduction en français du «De casibus virorum illustrium» par Laurent de Premierfait. Partant d’Adam et Eve, Boccace passe en revue les «cas et ruynes des nobles et femmes renversés par la fortune depuis la création du monde». On y trouve le récit des malheurs d’Athalie, de Denys de Syracuse, de Mithridate, de Philippe le Bel, de Pétrarque et de beaucoup d’autres, avec des considérations sur les songes prémonitoires, l’inconstance de la fortune, les dangers de l’oisiveté, etc. (Bechtel).
Le texte de cette édition reprend, avec un style rajeuni, celui de l’édition de 1483, chez Jean Dupré, qui est le premier livre parisien illustré. Dans l’histoire de l’imprimerie parisienne, Antoine Vérard tient une place majeure. Libraire- éditeur, très actif, il est celui qui a le plus contribué au développement de l’art de l’illustration dans le livre français.
Le premier feuillet (a1) est un facsimilé sur papier ancien. Il ne porte que deux lignes de texte : «Des nobles malheureux. Imprimé nouvellement à Paris», le verso est blanc. Il manque deux feuillets blancs (M10 et EE8). Texte sur deux colonnes en caractères gothiques. Initiales tracée au pinceau en rouge. L’exemplaire a été lavé.
Exemplaires conservés en France: BNF (2 ex.) et Institut de France (incomplet). Très rare. Nous n’avons pas trouvé d’exemplaire passé en vente depuis 40 ans.
<> Vérard’s first edition. It is beautifully illustrated by 10 large woodcuts. It is a French translation of «De casibus virorum illustrium» by Laurent de Premierfait. Boccace deals with the fortunes and calamities of famous people starting with the biblical Adam, going to mythological and ancient people, then to people of Boccaccio’s own time, with considerations on the premonitory dreams, the inconstancy of the fortune, the dangers of the idleness, etc... The work was successful, influencing many other famous authors such as Geoffrey Chaucer. The text of this edition is, with a modernized style, that of the edition of 1483, by Jean Dupré, which is the first illustrated Parisian book. Folio a1 is in facsimile, bearing only two lines of text: ""Des nobles malheureux. Imprimé nouvellement à Paris"", verso is blanck. It lacks two blanks leaves (M10 et EE8). ","de Croÿ p. 107; Fr.

Laurent made two translations of the Boccaccio work, the second considerably more free. A large percentage of surviving manuscripts are carefully written and illuminated with illustrations.
Laurent was born in Premierfait, a small village near Troyes. He lived at the papal court at Avignon for a while and came shoulder-to-shoulder with other humanists while being employed by the Papal Court. Laurent was well known for translating Aristotle,[4] Cicero, and Livy. He was also the first French translator of Giovanni Boccaccio's works.[5][6] He states in one of his works that he, like his interlocutor Jean de Montreuil, was a clerc du diocèse de Troyes and secretary-notary to Jean-Allarmet de Brogny, Cardinal of Saluces. Laurent worked as well for Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, Jean Chanteprime, contrôleur général des finances, and for king Charles VI. He made a living as a translator for such nobles as Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège and the great collector-connoisseur, Jean, Duke of Berry,[7] both being relatives to Charles VI.[8] Jacques Monfrin states that Laurent's translations were not done for the general public but more for wealthy aristocratic patrons.[9]

He may have died of the Black Death that wiped out about half of the European population recurring repeatedly from the mid fourteenth century. There is a possibility, however, that he was murdered during the invasion of Paris by the Burgundians in 1418, a result of the Armagnac-Burgundian civil war that raged in France after John the Fearless, Duc de Bourgogne, murdered the king's brother Louis d'Orléans in 1407.[10]

A portrait of Laurent, considered to be an authentic representation, figures among the illuminations in the manuscript of Du cas des nobles hommes et femmes that was dedicated to the duc de Berry and has come with the former royal library to the Bibliothèque Nationale.[11]","Boccaccio, Giovanni1494-1.jpg","Boccaccio, Giovanni1494-2.jpg","

The number of woodcuts was increased by almost one hundred, the text revised and enlarged, and for the first time, extended by Conrad Gesner's preface and bibliography of 300 botanical writers from the antiquity.  Gesner's influence is also evident in the the 5 indexes to the work (in Greek, Latin, German, Arabic, and Hebrew) and in an elaborate subject index, both modeled after the indexes to his Historia animalium.  About a fourth of the woodcuts are in contemporary coloring, among them the portrait and the striking genre scenes of trees in the third part.  A title label is attached to the last fly leaf to serve as a label for the book when inserted into a shelf spine first.   Hieronymus Bock was intended for a monastic life, but he rebelled against his parents' wishes and attended university instead. He began his career as a schoolteacher, but became fortunate enough to attract the attention of the Count Palatine Ludwig, who employed him as superintendent of his gardens in Zweibruecken. Bock made extensive botanical study-trips to the Hunsrueck, the Eifel, the Ardennes, the Vosges, the Swiss Jura, and the countries of the Rhine. He collected plants and cultivated his private garden in order to study their relations, with naming he followed antique examples. The first edition (1539) of Bock's herbal was not illustrated, the second one, published in 1546, had 465 woodcuts only, of which many had been copied from the works of Otto Brunfels and Leonhard Fuchs by the Strasbourg artist David Kandel (1527?-1595).   The significance of the work lies mostly in the accurate description of the structure of plants, as well as in that of their development in the course of the vegetation period, elaborate descriptions of the places where they were found are given. Unlike the other two so-called German Fathers of Botany, Bock set the authorities aside and chose to rely primarily on his own observations and experimentation. Until 1553 all editions were supervised by the author himself.  The great achievement of Bock was as a pioneer of descriptive botany (phytography). Brunfels' herbal had not sold well, and it was probably in part Bock's inability to persuade his publisher to pay for illustrations for the first edition of his New Kreütter Buch (1539) that obliged him to describe in detail facts that Brunfels and Fuchs mistakenly believed to have been adequately dealt with by their artists. In 1546 Bock, by judicious saving, was in a position to subsidize an illustrated edition of his herbal, now renamed Kreuter Buch.  Bock's book sold far better than Brunfels', better even than those of Fuchs. Hieronymus Bock's herbal was by far the most popular of the time and was re-issued in about twenty editions up to the 17th century.  The treatise of Benedict Textor (fl. 1530-1556) on Dioscorides is also included.  Inscription on flyleaf dated 1648. RCPE: Written by the second of the ""German fathers of botany"", Bock's 'Kreutterbuch' marked a new beginning in botany. Originally written in the vernacular it only became widely recognised with the above Latin translation. In his description of ca.700 plants and trees, Bock attempted to classify them into three groups: herbs and odoriferous plants, clovers or grasses, and trees or shrubs

Tessier provided a commentary on Dioscorides. 

The present edition is the most complete, with nearly one hundred additional woodcuts, and is enhanced with valuable prefatory texts by Conrad Gessner and Benoit Tixier, including a bibliography of botanical works. While many of the woodcuts are copies from Fuchs and Brunfels, a number are original designs by David Kandel, often with charming peripheral depictions of people, animals or insects (including a unicorn under a date palm). Kandel was sent as a young artist to Bock to make the illustrations, and clearly worked from living or dried specimens in a number of instances, while also depending on earlier illustrations of Fuchs editions and Weiditz.

The illustrations next appeared in 1569 edition of Dalechamps. Botallo supported Maggi (his former pupil) and Paré in denying the poisonous nature of gunshot wounds as had been advocated by Vigo and Ferri.  He too advocated mild treatment of gunshot wounds. This influential work went through several editions: Venice (1564) and Frankfurt (1575), as well as being inserted in a miscellany on military medicine published in Venise in 1566.
Botallo came from Asti and studied under Falloppius and Vittore Trincavelli (1496-1548).  Botallo was physician to Charles IX and Henri III.  His name is associated with the congenital cardiac anomalies of the duct and foramen of Botallo.  Through his observation, he discovered or independently rediscovered that the blood's passage from the right to the left side of the heart in the fetus was by way of the foramen ovale cordis (Botallo's foramen). His discovery was published in De catarrho commentarius (Paris,1564). He also observed the arterial duct from the pulmonary artery to the aorta which also carries his name although he was not the original discoverer of either of these features.

Catherine de' Medici, was instrumental in having his services transferred to her favorite son, the Duke of Anjou, later Henry III.  He practiced medicine in Asti before 1544, and joined the French forces in Italy as a military surgeon.  In 1560 he was already located in Paris as one of the physicians of Charles IX, having been called there by his patron, Catherine de' Medici.  Sometime before 1575 he became physician to the Duke of Anjou, later Henry III. At various times he was also physician to Elizabeth of Austria, Louise of Lorraine, William Duke of Brabant, the Duke of Guise, and Prince William of Orange.

He had a regular stipend of 400 livres and apparently received other payments. 
Sometime before 1575 he became physician to the Duke of Anjou, later Henry III. At various times he was also physician to Elizabeth of Austria, Louise of Lorraine, William Duke of Brabant, the Duke of Guise, and Prince William of Orange. 
Mazzuchelli says that he was appointed Bishop of St. Malo. Careri says that this is not documented and no one else mentions it. However, Henry III made him a counselor and conferred honorary ecclesiastical positions, from which he could have the income, on him. There is documentary evidence that he held the Abbacy of Notre Dame de Change. 
Near the end of his life, Botallo was apparently in economic straits. (Note that he did not enrich himself.) Catherine de' Medici took steps to insure that he had enough money. She had him confirmed in the Abbacy of Notre Dame de Chage, a position he was able to pass on, during his life but not after his death, to a nephew who was a cleric. Catherine de' Medici wrote a number of letters for him in her own hand, some to the King, wanting to be sure that one who had served her well was not neglected.

The tradition goes back to early medieval times both in England and on the Continent...In a ship laden with one hundred fools, steered by fools to the fools' paradise of Narragonia, Brant satirizes all the weakness, follies and vices of his time. Composed in popular humorous verse and illustrated by a remarkable series of woodcuts...the book was an immediate success. Brant's purpose was a moral one: he wanted to improve the life of his contemporaries and to help in the regeneration of the Holy Roman Empire and the Church...the book also contains the earliest literary reference to the discovery of America [on k4v]; the Columbus Letter had been published by the same printer the year previously. The influence of The Ship of Fools was extensive and prolonged: thirty-six editions were published between 1494 and 1513...There were twelve translations in about forty different editions. Its most immediate imitators were Geiler von Kaisersberg, Thomas Murner, Hans Sachs and Johannes Fischart in Germany, where the ëNarrí as a type has lived until today. Erasmusís Moriae Encomium was directly inspired by it. The Ship of Fools was the first original work by a German which passed into world literature...[It] played an important part in European literature, and helped to blaze the trail that leads from medieval allegory to modern satire, drama and the novel of character (Printing and the Mind of Man). The Latin version of Das Narrenschiff was made under Brant's close supervision by his favorite pupil Jacobus Locher (1471-1528).

Before Goethe’s Werther arrived on the scene, this work was the most successful book ever published in Germany, immensely popular and read until it fell to pieces. This is one of literature’s most famous satires and a remarkable illustrated book. Sebastian Brant describes in his “Ship of Fools” the voyage of a ship bearing 100 fools, to the fools’ paradise of Narragonia, and he satirizes all the follies of his time including representatives of every human and social type.

PMM calls it “the first original work by a German which passed into world literature.and helped to blaze the trail that leads from medieval allegory to modern satire, drama and novel of character”.  The reference to the newly discovered America is found on fol. 76 verso (cf. Harrise, BAV, Additions, no. 21).

Nowadays, in general, about two-thirds of the 114 illustrations (counting 9 repeating ones) in the 1494 edition are attributed to the young Dürer, while the rest, which are found inferior in design and cutting, are ascribed to anonymous masters, such as the so-called Master of the Haintz Narr (named after the namesake scene in The Ship of Fools). A more conservative view, expressed by the art historian Erwin Panofsky in 1945, attributes only one-third of the illustrations to Dürer.

FIRST LATIN EDITION of the Ship of Fools. The Basel humanist Sebastian Brant describes the sea journey of 112 fools (representing the follies of human weakness and vice) to ""Naragonia"" the paradise of fools. The fine woodcut illustrations are those commissioned for the first edition (in German) of 1494, also printed by Bergmann at Basel, 75 of which are now attributed to Dürer, who resided in Basel for a few months in 1494. The fools in Dürer's woodcuts are recognized by the bells on their caps. 15 other illustrations are attributed to the Master of Haintz Narr. His fools wear coxcombs instead of bells. ""The woodcut illustrations created for the Das Narrenschiff are of immense density and tenseness. Since there was no iconographical tradition for this newly conceived text, the subjects and scenes of the illustrations had to be created entirely new. The images presented are of such convincing force that their equal in design had never before been seen"" (A Heavenly Craft, p. 63). The Ship of Fools is the first literary work to announce the discovery of the New World, which is not surprising, since it was Bergmann who published the first German edition of the the Columbus letter, announcing his discovery of the New World, in 1493. 

After the young Dürer had learned the painting and engraving trade with Michael Wohlgemuth in Nuremberg, the 19-year-old Dürer set out on a journey in 1490. Between the spring of 1492 and the fall of 1493 he worked in Basel, and on the 8th. In August 1492, his first entry woodcut, signed by him and still preserved in Basel, appeared there for the ""Epistolae beati Hieronymi"". In 1493, the ""Knight of the Turn"" and in 1494 the ""Ship of Fools"" appeared with his woodcuts. Since not all woodcuts in the fool ship came from Dürer, his authorship remained hidden for a long time. In 1951, the art historian Friedrich Winkler discovered the ""signature"" of Dürer in the woodcuts. Dürer put on each fool's cap ""a series of bells that stretch like a crown over the skull between the ears"" (Winkler: Dürer and the illustrations for the Fool Ship, 12). This distinction is apart from some restrictions, valid until today. (see Cornelia Schneider, Das Narrenschiff 2004, 140). The peculiarity of Dürer's woodcuts lies in their realistic version. Never before in the old German woodcut have the landscape, the interior, the streetscape, the farm, the beautiful view, the thicket of a shrubbery or the vast expanse of the sea been the main motifs of images and rendered with such astonishing persuasiveness. Of the 105 woodcuts of the ""Ship of Fools"", 73 are now assigned to the main master Dürer. There has been no more momentous step in the history of woodcut than the introduction of realism. It was not possible without strong internal modeling. The woodcut production of the two decades before, in which thousands of book images have been torn in Germany, is still the outline woodcut arrested (see Winkler 1951).

Notes: This 'curious and amusing droll old book' (as per an old bookseller's description tipped onto the inside fron cover) first appeared in German in 1494, and in Latin, at Basle, 1 March 1497, of which this a reprint with different woodcuts. There was another Strasbourg reprint (Strasbourg being Brant's native city) by Johann Schönsperger, 1 April 1497, which included the Basle colophon. Brant spared no-one in his satire, and the book immediately became immensely popular, in fact an unprecedented bestseller, with numerous authorised and unauthorised editions.  'The Influence of ""The Ship of Fools"" was extensive and prolonged ... [It] was the first original work by a German which passed into world literature ... Brant's book played an important part in European literature, and helped to blaze the trail that leads from medieval allegory to modern satire, drama and the novel of character' (PMM).

Grüninger produced four editions, all rare. Three were in German, while the fourth, of which this is a copy, bears the Latin text and is illustrated with earlier and new woodblocks. The iconographic apparatus, realised by two or three woodcarvers, takes inspiration from the ones designed by Brant and probably by Dürer for the first edition, though it differs greatly in terms of style on account of the new chiaroscuro technique introduce by Grüninger: “It consisted in a close system of parallel lines of shading, straight or curved, according to the requirements of form, which approxmated more nearly than woodcut had hitherto done to the richer tonal character of line engraving” (Hind).
Exploiting the traditional theme of folly, Stultifera navis is a piercing attack on contemporary society. The vast array of illustrations, comprising 118 large woodcuts, serves this purpose. It depicts visionary and grotesque scenes in which characters from all classes are mocked by Brant, from clerics, dames, knights and rulers to peasants and fools. One can also find animals, skeletons, demons and other infernal figures. Indoor and outdoor settings (bed chambers, kitchens, city or countryside views) are equally remarkable because of their Gothic style. Characters perform various activities condemned by the author, such as gambling, or they represent specific vices, such as vanity, arrogance, incompetence and so on. Particularly striking is the illustration at f. 47 v, as it appears to be one of the earliest depiction of a backgammon match between a couple exemplifying bad parenting. At f. 62, Brant’s distiches made an early reference to the discovery of the New World.
”The Ship of Fools was the first original work by a German which passed into world literature. . . and helped to blaze the trail that leads from medieval allegory to modern satire, drama and the novel of character.”(Printing and the Mind of Man, p. 22).

Rare first edition of Brunfels’s early medical dictionary, written to assist practicing physicians and apothecaries reading the standard medical-botanical authors of the time (Galen, Dioscorides, Pliny). The work precedes by thirty years Estienne’s better known Dictionarium medicum and is more encyclopedic than lexicographical, making it difficult to understand why it is omitted from Garrison-Morton (see #6787 and following): G-M lists two incunable dictionaries which pre-date this, as does Fries 1519 Synonima. Since the components of most medicaments were natural, the work is properly included in botanical bibliographies (Pritzel, etc.). Though “medicine” appears in the title, the work encompasses a much wider field than that designated nowadays by the term, including entries relating to botany, meteorology, alchemy and even magic. 

Brunfels’s passion for collecting and organizing vast amounts of information into intelligent, digestible form is evident from his first publication, the Catalogus illustrium medicorum (1530), one of the earliest medical bibliographies; it can even be seen in his greatest work, the Herbarum, which changed the study of botany, freeing it from the superstitions of medieval herbals.

Some corrections by Hans Schönsperger were added in this Augsburg edition of December 1497.  The Strasbourg edition is printed in 2 columns and the Augsburg in a single column which conveys less of a medieval appearance to the work.  Eleven small woodcuts show surgical instruments.  Although this is considered the first illustrated book of surgery, there is no image that helps the surgeon perform his operations.  The images are made from smaller woodblocks that are rearranged throughout the book to provide different scenes of consultations that are of limited surgical value.  The emphasis is on common problems such as wounds, fractures, dislocations and medications.  The 1460 manuscript of Heinrich Pfolspeundt on gunshot wounds was not published until the 19th century.  The woodcuts of the lecturer, the interior of the apothecary shop and the skeletal figure used by Grüninger in the added chapter on anatomy also appear in Ortus Sanitatis of 1497 published by Johann Prüss. The piracy prompted Grüninger to reissue his work with four additional chapters including one on amputation as well as a correction of the last quire to correct the misprint in the colophon of 1397 for 1497. Cushing has the ""1397"" edition & Yale also has an incomplete colored copy of the Augsburg edition.  There are several variations among the corrected Grüninger copies since the new additions were added in different amounts to the remaining copies of the first issue. There are 49 illustrations with some repeats.  

Eleven small woodcuts show surgical instruments. In both editions, some of the woodblocks are divided into halves and are used in different combinations.

The woodblocks are again divided into halves and used in different combinations.  There are also small cutouts of woodblocks to allow for changes in healing of different wounds.  These changes are seen in the first edition but the small inserts were probably lost by the time of this printing.  The technique can be seen in the illustrations on K2r, K5r and P2r.  The insert is missing from the illustration on P1r leaving a blank rectangle.  This certainly predates the use of this method always cited for Estienne.  In this edition there are 10 full page cuts and 6 repeats for a total of 16 full woodcuts and 25 illustrations made of repeated split woodblocks.  Collation complete but foliation errors occur on ll. xxxii, lii, liii, lvi, xc, ci, cxviii, & cxxiii.

Brunschwig's 'Großes Destillierbuch' (Large Book of Distillation) counts among the earliest pharmaceutical work in German; there is prove of only six copies of this extended second edition in libraries. A must-have for historically-minded pharmacists and likewise for collectors of rare books in general! 
Object is regular taxed. 7% VAT is added to the purchase price for deliveries within the EU. 

This post incunabula is one of the earliest pharmaceutical works, as well as one of the first medical works of all published in German. In second edition of the famous so-called 'Großes Destillierbuches' (Large Book of Distillation)  not to be confused with the completely different so-called 'Kleines Destillierbuch' (Little Book of Distillation) from 1500  as the same illustrations that had already been used in the first edition from 1512 were increased by several new woodcuts and by text parts. This work discusses the extraction of elixirs through the distillation of various herbs, as well as their usage. It was for its detailed and illustrated descriptions that it remained influential in medicine for a long time and that it had decisive impact on the development of pharmaceutics in general. In five parts it contains the general art of distillation, dispensatory, composita organized in order of the illnesses of the individual organs, surgical dispensatory and the pharmacopeia for the poor.

Illustration 

Fine Gothic type in two columns. Roman pagination. Contains, next to the full-page title woodcut 145 woodcuts, of which one in double-page size. These partly originate from the 'Margarita philosophica' by Gregorius Reisch (illustration of the eye, man with open chest, phrenologic head, model of internal organs, pharmacies, laboratories, chemical devices etc.). The title woodcut gained particular international renown. It shows two elegantly dressed men working on a large distillation facility with various inscribed tubes and poppets. The work is consistently endowed with numerous woodcut initials. The entire work's strong impression on firm laid paper is particularly worthwhile mentioning. Size of leaves: 29 x 18 cm. Text area: 24 x 15 cm. 

Condition: Still in good condition. Thoroughly restored. Pages evenly and just slightly browned, stained or finger-stained in places. Title and following 25 leaves as well as last 15 leaves with just slight worming without noteworthy impairments. The paper's structure of 35 leaves was reinforced with Japon. About 50 leaves with brownish spots, of which 10 leaves stronger affected. With few hand-written marginalia. A slightly medical scent suggests that the book was kept in a doctors practice or a laboratory for some time. The laid paper is firm, the impression strong. Remarkably appealing woodcut illustrations. 

Binding: 20th century dark brown calf binding with two gilt-tooled labels on spine with title and year. Binding just minimally rubbed. Pastedown with mounted remains of the old title on spine and with marbled half title. Book block firm and stable. Four original raised bands. Dimensions of folio volume: 30.5 x 21.5 x 6.5 cm. 

Provenance: E.L. Corning, New York, 1860. Ladislao Reti (1901-1973), science historian and reconstructing engineer of the 'Artificio de Juanelo' (Toledo Water Art) 



","Beautiful large woodcut on title, ff. roman numb. 330, illustrated throughout with 145 woodcuts (one double- page). Second edition (first 1512), nonetheless rare, of the so called “Grosses Distillierbuch” by Hieronymus Brunschwig (circa 1450 - circa 1512), who, after receiving an education in surgery, traveled extensively through Alsace, South and Middle Germany, practicing as surgeon and acquiring knowledge on chemistry and pharmacology with a particular interest for distillation. At the end of the 15th century he moved permanently to Strasbourg and published soon his first works, one of his earliest was the Kleinen Distillierbuchs in 1500, printed by Grüninger, which would become the base for the Grosses Distillierbuch later on. Following still the style of the incunabula herbals, his work was the first to introduce the extraction of essential oils from plants. The first part of the book occupies itself with the procedures and technical practice of distillery by steam and required instruments as well as the base materials (plants but also animals), it also described how to separate alcohol from wine, mead or fermented fruits. Within the second part the author lists a quite good number of plants and the single qualities of their different parts. the third and last part contains a list of essential oils, in order of their therapeutic qualities, aromatic and empyreumatic ones. 

Folio (cm 30), attractive, contemporary blindstamped brown calf on wooden boards (carefully restored and rebacked), marginal spots to first 15 leaves and to last leaves, some general light browning for the quality of the paper (as usual), a repair to the last leaf with little loss of 3 or 4 words, some underlinings and manuscript marginal notes, ownership entries on flyleaves and on title-leaf, recto e verso (dated 1605 e 1638).","Martius A2v (1528), B1r (1519); de Croÿ p. 41 (?ed); Maunsell II: p. 8 (Eng); Oiselius Medici F65 (1532); Fr.

(Browned, small wormholes in first and final few quires, some dampstaining.) Modern calf, red leather spine label. Provenance: a few contemporary annotations.

SECOND EDITION of 'a pharmaceutical-technical handbook that was the authority far into the sixteenth century' (DSB). It contains a wealth of information on methods of distillation, on plants and their medicinal use, on remedies and on surgery. The Thesaurus pauperum, which forms book five, was a useful pharmacopeia for the poor and was often reprinted. Written in German in order to have the widest practical influence, the Grosses Distillierbuch also derived much of its value from the many illustrations which accompany it, some of which had appeared in previous Grüninger editions. The Grosses Distillierbuch is a considerably enlarged version of the Kleines Distillierbuch, which Brunschwig published in 1500.

A work on veterinarian medicine, Proprytees & Medicynes of Hors, was printed by Wynckn de Worde ca. 1497-98 and again in 1502.  Pynson published several works of Galen from 1522-1524(Rylands p. 716).  This is a handbook for laymen on hygiene and diet not written for physicians or surgeons. (See Ham House Catalogue, 1938 and Morgan Library-Early Printed Books: 23). The only earlier medical or surgical works printed in England, although they are in Latin, are several editions of Linacre's translations of Galen: 1522, 1523 & 1524 published by Pynson in London and Siberch 1521-1524 in Cambridge (see  Hultman Lot 256 & Freeling Lot 1299, Roy 1107).  See McKerrow and Ferguson: Title -page Borders. 1932.  

Although the text is a translation of Brunschwig, the illustrations are copied from Gersdorff.  The 8 full page woodcuts are copied after Gersdorff (the first of many copies) and a version of the cerebral ventricular system similar to Reisch and Romberch de Kyrspe.  Unlike the other editions of Brunschwig (1497 Strasbourg and Augsburg folios, 1534 and 1539 Augsburg quartos), this edition uses wood cuts copied from Gersdorff and other sources which represent surgical and anatomical views rather than the generic illustrations of medical scenes found in the original edition.  A Dutch edition appeared in Utrecht in 1535 with illustrations similar to the English edition (Rosenwald 1108).

He does however provide a list of those, ancient and modern, ""which have been excellent in the worthy art of Chirurgi,"" among the moderns, Conrad Gesner, Ryff, Tagault, Fuchs, Massa, Pol, Brunfels, Matthioli, and Paracelsus. The Booke of Compoundes ends with ""Apothicaries rules."" Among these are the injunction to read Dioscorides, and the requirement that the apothecary's garden be close at hand, and the apothecary needs to tend it himself.

The botanical woodcuts, which appear in a section before the index, depict plants such as 'Strabery, the great nightshade, Radishe, Cherie, Hyssope, Chickenweede', etc. The skeletal woodcut appears to derive from Brunschwig, as probably do the woodcuts of stills.

Elève à Pavie de Pietro Martire, disciple de Vésale, Carcano (Milan, 1536 - Pavie, 1606) est nommé chirurgien du corps de l'artillerie dans l'armée du duc d'Albe. Il se spécialise alors dans l'étude des blessures par armes à feu, et s'engage dans des réflexions contre les méthodes chirurgicales des Espagnols qu'il considère inutilement douloureuses. Il est chargé de la direction de l'hôpital militaire de Milan, puis passe deux ans à Padoue où il rencontre Gabriele Falloppia qui l'initie à l'anatomie moderne et publie ses recherches sur le coeur du foetus et l'oeil. Dépassé par Fabricius de Aquapendente à la chaire d'anatomie de Padoue, il obtient celle de Pavie. Sa renommée fut encore accrue par la permission qu'il reçut de pratiquer l'autopsie du grand évèque Charles Borromée, mort en 1584.

Fort de ses expériences depuis sa jeunesse sur les champs de bataille, il compile et revoit alors un ensemble de cas de blessures qu'il avait eues à traiter et publie son oeuvre finale, De vulneribus capitis, version moderne du De vulneribus capitis d'Hippocrate quelque mille ans plus tôt. 
Divisé en trois parties, l'ouvrage traite de l'anatomie cranienne, des contusions et fractures et chirurgie craniennes et ses thérapeutiques post-opératoires. Il met en garde contre les coups légers mais mortels, la trépanation systématique, l'usage d'onguents et emplâtres..., à l'aide d'observations pratiques d'une grande précision, basées sur l'expérience et l'examen, en plein accord avec les principes de la médecine humaniste.
Sont cités Hippocrate, Avicenne et Galien bien sûr, mais aussi parmi les modernes, Fallope, Manardi, Vidius, Settala, Selvatico, Rovida, Casati, Molteni, Alessandri, Ferrari...

The De medicina was the first organised treatise on medicine to be printed, and the first Western history of medicine. Written in about A.D. 30, it remains the greatest medical treatise from ancient Rome. Celsus’ fine literary style earned him the title of Cicero medicorum, his Latin terminology creating a nomenclature that is still in use today. His work is in eight books, the first four of which deal with diseases treated by diet and regimen, the last four describing those amenable to drugs and surgery. The third book contains, among other things, the first use of the term ‘insanity’ (Insania), and the first adumbration of heart disease (Cardiacus), which became the canon of subsequent knowledge in antiquity. The fourth book contains the four classical signs of inflammation (dolor, tumor, rubor, calor). The fifth book begins with a classified list of drugs, followed by a chapter on weights and measures, pharmaceutical methods, and prescriptions. The sixth book treats of skin and venereal diseases, as well as those of the eye, ear, nose, throat and mouth. The seventh book is surgical (see Garrison pp. 107–109). The surgical chapters contain the first account of the use of the ligature, excellent descriptions of lateral lithotomy and herniotomy, and the earliest discussion in Western literature of the repair of mutilations, including plastic operations for restoring the nose, lips, ears, etc. (Zeis Index 21 and 2116; “certainly the earliest writer on plastic surgery,” p. 1). There are numerous important contributions to dentistry, and a classic description of malaria (Major p. 96).

A fine copy from the library of Beriah Botfield (1807–1863), his sale Christie’s-Longleat London, 30 March 1994, lot 11. Botfield's mother was the daughter of William Withering.","The De Medicina was the first organized treatise on medicine to be printed, and the first Western history of medicine. Written in about A.D. 30, it remains the greatest medical treatise from ancient Rome. 

Celsus’ text was virtually unknown in the Middle Ages, as the manuscript was lost until its rediscovery in 1426 in Siena. Nevertheless it became a standard text for centuries. It was edited for publication, as such among the earliest medical books to be printed, by Bartolomeo Fonzio (Fontius 1445–1513).

The book is constructed of both quarto and folio gatherings. This copy has the headline on O5r correctly reading “Quintus”, “BARTHOLOMEVS” on ð1b, and gg1 signed. Earlier this century the De Medicina was not an uncommon book, but this (very nice) copy and the (not very nice) Norman copy are the only complete examples to have appeared for public sale in the last 50 years; the three other copies during that period all had leaves lacking or inserted.

1525. Xylography, 1525, dated in the lower plate. Magnificent evidence, particularly contrasted, printed on contemporary laid paper with watermark ""shield surmounted by crown"", complete with the marginal line, small restoration at the upper right corner, in excellent condition. The cataloging of this important work is absolutely controversial; attributed by Bartsch to Albrecht Durer, then from Pauli to Hans Sebald Beham, recently Zurwesten inserts it again in Durer's work, considering it as the most important work of the master in the field of ex-libris. Experts today agree that Durer himself drew this work, then carved by Hieronymus Andreae Resch, as demonstrated by the monogram placed near the date ""R A 1525"" (Resch year 1525). In Northern Europe of the early Renaissance a considerable group of artists dedicated themselves to the realization of ex-libris, in great demand by important figures to identify the possession of books and art objects. From 1490 there are several examples of such works, in the Nuremberg school and in particular the Little Masters; their aesthetic quality had a remarkable development with the passing of the years, increasing in the number of the ornaments and the finesse of the carving. Hector Pomer was a prelate of the church of San Lorenzo in Nuremberg, for this reason the ex-libris depicts San Lorenzo, in the classic iconography with the grid and the palm of martyrdom. Fantastic example. Woodcut, 1525, dated on plate at lower edge. 
The cataloging of this work is extremely controversial; it has been first ascribed to Albrecht Durer by Bartsch; then to Hans Sebald Beham by Pauli. Zurwesten has been included in Durer's work, considering the most important piece of the master in the field of ex-libris. Nowadays, the experts agree that Durer himself prepared the drawing of this work, afterwards carved by Hieronymus Andreae Resch, as it is shown by the monogram ""R A 1525"" (Resch, year 1525). In the Northern Europe, a large group of artists was used to implement many ex-libris, much in demand among the famous people to identify their possession of books and pieces of art. Starting from the year 1490, we have had many examples of the genre, mainly from the school of Nuremberg and especially from the so called Little Masters; they have a great development in the years, increasing the number of ornaments and the perfection of the carving. Hector Pomer was a Provost of the church of St. Laurence in Nuremberg; that is why we find St. Laurence portrayed with the gridiron and the palm of martyrdom, according to the classical iconography.

[City of London]'.

Two medical works, collected by Hector Pömer, one of the most influential of Nuremberg churchmen during the Reformation. Dürer's large woodcut depicts a full-length figure of St Lawrence, reflecting the fact that Pömer became provost of the Nuremberg parish of St. Lorenz in 1520. There are annotations by different contemporary hands in the two works. The annotations in the Villanova are cropped by the binder for whose work Pömer paid '84d.' on 23 July 1525. The 1497 Celsus is the fourth edition of 'the oldest medical document after the Hippocratic writings' (Garrison and Morton 20). Written c.30 A.D., the De medicina was lost for most of the Middle Ages until it was recovered in 1426-1443. It was the first organized treatise on medicine to be printed (at Florence in 1478). Arnaldus de Villanova, probably Catalonian by birth, studied medicine at Montpellier until 1260, and was later personal physician to several popes and kings of Aragon, in spite of which he was imprisoned on several occasions and had his more controversial works censored and burned.

It is one of the earliest known bookplates, with earlier examples dating to c.1480, for books of the Carthusian monastery of Bruxheim; other examples of German originals are ascribed to Cranach, Holbein, Solis, Amman, later in the 16th century. The bookplate was made for Dr. Hector Pömer (1495-1541), featuring St. Lawrence –reflecting Pomer's position as provost of the Nuremberg parish of St. Lorenz in 1520-, and a escutcheon “with the Pömer arms and the gridiron of St Laurence, with crest, helm and mantling.

When it was published for the first time, in 1478, it was one of the first organized medicine treatises to be printed: “one of the first medical books to be printed"" (Garrison), ""our fundamental source for the history of Alexandrian medicine; the greatest medical work of antiquity after those of Hippocrates and Galen"" (Sarton). In reality it was part of a larger encyclopedia, which is now lost; it is overall one of the most significant works for the history of medicine.

Artist: Sebald Beham (German, Nuremberg 1500–1550 Frankfurt)
Artist: formerly attributed to Albrecht Dürer (German, Nuremberg 1471–1528 Nuremberg)
Date: 1525
Woodcut by Hieronymus Resch after a design by Hans Sebald Beham, Nuremberg, 1525.
Dodgson comments that the monogram RA has been associated with Hieronymus Andreae or Resch since the early nineteenth century, although it is not clear why Andreae should have chosen to sign with those initials. Emich suggests that the block is signed R.for Resch and A[nno] 1525
The arms of Hector Pömer; an escutcheon with the Pömer arms and the gridiron of St Laurence, with crest (a demi-nun), on the helmet and mantling. Placed under an arch, St. Laurence standing on the left. In the four corners small escutcheons with the arms of Pömer, Rummel, Schmiedmaier and Bergmeister. Below a strip with a Hebrew, Greek and Latin motto and the name. 1525 Woodcut, 1525, 288 x 189 mm., Bartsch 163 (as Dürer), Pauli 1352 (as Beham). Fine impression, showing the same losses in the borderline as other impressions seen, on thin, brownish, laid paper with an indecipherable watermark, and thread margins outside the borderline. The work was originally catalogued by Bartsch as Dürer. Pauli claimed it as H. S. Beham, which has been maintained for many years, Opinion may now be shifting back to Dürer. The monogram at the base of the design is that of the block cutter (formschneider), believed to be Hieronymous Andreä, sometimes called Resch, who is best known as the cutter of Dürer's huge Triumphal Arch woodcut and esteemed as one of the finest cutters of his time. However, none of the other blocks known to have been cut by Andreä bear this monogram. To further complicate matters, Andreä is also known to have worked with Beham. Pömer was provost of the Church of St. Lawrence in Nuremberg in 1525 and would presumably have been acquainted with both Dürer and Beham. St. Lawrence, his patron, is pictured here holding up the shield of the Pömer family and in the four corners are the shields of related families. Pömer had two smaller bookplates by Beham described by Emich as well as 17th century bookplates of other family members.

A manuscript of the work was rediscovered in Milan in 1443.  This is usually cited as a compilation of other writers rather than as an original work.  The first printed edition appeared in Florence in 1478; an Aldine edition was published in 1528.
First Edition of Scribonius (G-M 1785), with early editions of Celsus (G-M 20) and Benivieni (G-M 2270). The first medical author of note after Celsus, Scribonius was physician to the Empress Messalina and accompanied the Emperor Claudius on his expedition to Britain in 43 A.D. He wrote his work on pharmacology shortly thereafter, giving a collection of 271 remedies, including the first definition of opium as an extract, the first account of electrotherapy for headaches (via the torpedo's shock), an expectorant mixture for phthisis, and an early reference to the Hippocratic Oath. Considered the earliest extant dispensatory (Kremers & Urdang, p. 19), De compositionibus medicamentorum contains both scientific and magical remedies, including the drinking of one's own blood.

Among the 271 remedies are the first use of electrotherapy (for headaches) using the shock of the torpedo fish. Kremers & Urdang p.26: The first dispensatory, i.e, collection of formulas for immediate practical use, to be regarded as a kind of precursor to the later pharmacopoeias, is the 'Compositiones of the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, written about A.D. 43. A great part of the preface of this dispensatory is devoted to the defense of a thorough and plentiful use of medicaments and to the fight against medical nihilism, which existed in those early days. The formulary of Scribonius Largus contains only a few simples (simplicia), most of his formulas representing compounded medicaments (composita), with many ingredients. Scribonius describes the preparation and gives the first definition of opium, insisting on the use of immature poppy capsules as the source of opium and reserving the designation of meconium for the inspissated juice of the poppy leaves. He warns against the substitution of the juice of the poppy leaves for the juice of the unripe capsules as the pigmentarii prepare it in order to make a profit.""

Champier examines the conformity between Plato and Aristotle on the one hand, and Galen and Hippocrates on the other. The punning title is taken up in the lovely woodcut on the titlepage, showing a symphony of the four characters, in a string quartet with Galen on fiddle, perhaps leading the quartet, Plato, Aristotle and Hippocrates on viols and cellos.
Symphorien Champier was born at St. Saphorine-le-Château, in the Lyonais, and gained his medical education at Montpellier. He was an alderman of the city of Lyon in 1520 and in 1533 established the College of Medicine in the city. Champier studied Greek and Arabic texts and wrote a number of historical works as well as his large output of medical works.
Garrison calls him ‘One of the earliest of the French humanists’ and ‘one of the last of the conciliators of Greek and Arabist doctrine’ (History of Medicine, 4th edition, 1929, p. 196).

Dans ce curieux traité, le médecin lyonnais Symphorien Champier (v. 1471-1538) s'attache à démontrer la conformité entre les doctrines d'Aristote et de Platon, d'une part, et celles d'Hippocrate et de Galien, d'autre part (Hippocrate occupant selon lui la position la plus élevée parmi ces ""quatre princes de la médecine"").

Second edition, a re-impression of the first of 1514. A very beautiful piece of printing from the press of Jodocus Badius, displaying many of his magnificent woodcut initials. The charming title-woodcut shows the author seated at a desk in a garden, holding in his left hand an enormous rose and pointing with his right to a closed book. Before him sits a lady holding a daisy (margarita) and an open book on her lap.  The Rosa Gallica is a treatise on medicine, but with gastronomic interest. It discusses food and drink, and various bodily functions such as sleeping, bathing, exercising, and sexual intercourse. The work is divided into two parts, the first, Rosa Gallica, describes how to live a healthy life; the second, Margarita, is on curative medicine.

Servetus served as Champier's secretary before going to Paris in 1536 to study medicine. This position placed him, as Michel de Villeneuve, in frequent contact with Cardinal François de Tournon, head of the French inquisition.



Florilegium of ancient and medieval thought on medicine, hygiene, diet, and general health, compiled by a prominent Lyonnese physician (1471–1539). Following that Rosa Gallica is an additional treatise on procedures for doctors, entitled Margarita in tribute to the author's wife, Marguerite Terrail. This is the 1518 reimpression of the 1514 first edition, both Renouard and Vicaire saying with certainty that it faithfully reproduces that original. Its title-page bears an attractive woodcut of the author holding an oversized rose and pointing to a book, while Marguerite (with a daisy in hand) sits nearby in an enclosed garden with a book of her own.","Riolan p. 71; Gras p. 50;  Galloys O5080; du Fay 1235* (1514); Rivinus 5003; Hoym 1182 (1514); Burette 6318 (1514); Salthenius 2906 (1514); de Witt 1752: 852; Rega Med O519 (1514); Crevenna II: 204; Bolongaro-Crevenna 2591; Baron 2078 (1514); Wittwer II: O1406.2; Petit 1977; L'Héritier de Brutelle 1946; Dosnier & Vauvilliers 790 (1514); Baldinger 9450 (1514),15055; Panzer 1599 (1514),1635; Bosquillon 1422 (?1512); van den Zande 1033; Huzard III: 812 (1514),813; Jussieu 3445 (1514); Libri 1861: 1563 (1514); Yemeniz 2436 (1514); Davidson 1030 (1514); Borghese II: 460; Ashburnham 1020 (1514); Pichon 1976; Payne 133 (1514); Fugger II: 416 (1514); Rahir 451; Wilmerding III: 193 (1514);  Brunschwig 361; Willis King 102 (1514);",Provenance: Bookplate from Nordkirchen.

Later editions appeared in 1596 and 1637 with slight variations in the title and inclusion of much of his earlier work on Morbus Gallicus. This is the first work in English to deal with military surgery.  Clowes apprenticed with George Keble, a London surgeon, and began his practice as an army surgeon in 1563 under the command of the Earl of Warwick.  He also served in the navy before he settled in London in 1569 and worked at St. Bartholomew's and Christ's Hospital.  He was considered to be one of the outstanding surgeons of this period although he made no specific contribution.  In 1585 Queen Elizabeth sent him to the Low Countries under the Earl of Leicester. He returned to sea again against the Spanish Armada. His son, William Clowes (1582-1648), was also a surgeon and served as sergeant-surgeon to Charles I.

DNB: Clowes began practice in 1563 as a surgeon in the army commanded by Ambrose, earl of Warwick, in France, and on this expedition began his lifelong friendship with John Banester the surgeon (Banester, Antidotarie, 1589; Clowes, Treatise on Struma, 1602). Besides a power of ready expression in colloquial English, he shows a vast acquaintance with proverbs, and a fair knowledge of French and of Latin. His books were all printed in London in black letter and 4to, and are: 1. ‘De Morbo Gallico,’ 1579. 2. ‘A Prooved Practise for all young Chirurgians concerning Burnings with Gunpowder, and Woundes made with Gunshot, Sword, Halbard, Pike, Launce, or such other,’ 1591. 3. ‘Treatise of the French or Spanish Pocks, by John Almenar,’ 1591 (a fresh edition of 1). 4. ‘A Profitable and Necessary Book of Observations,’ 1596 (a fresh edition of 2). 5. ‘A Right Frutefull and Approved Treatise for the Artificiall Cure of the Struma or Evill, cured by the Kinges and Queenes of England,’ 1602. In 1637 reprints of his ‘De Morbo Gallico’ and ‘Profitable Book of Observations’ were published. Letters by him are printed in Banester's ‘Antidotarie’ (1589), and in Peter Lowe's ‘Surgery’ (1597).","Maunsell II: p. 5; London Cat: Z3v; Salmon 1713: Q647 (?ed); Beckett Q25; Guenz II: 3045 (1596); Harley II: 13333 (1637); Hall 2408; Mortimer 1753: Q1660 (1588); Heister 3823 (1637); Osborne 1764: 4658 (1637); West 2212 (1637); Brand 2579 (1637),2595 (1588); Inglis 365 (1596); Hastie-Tracy 3056 (1588); Payne 156 (1637); Britwell p. 214 (1588);",Provenance: Haskell Norman's bookplate. on fep,"William Clowes was born at Kingsbury in Warwickshire, the son of Thomas and the grandson of Nicholas Clowes. Earlier members of the family, which was of sufficient importance to have its own coat of arms and crest, lived at Tutbury in Staffordshire.  The Dictionary of National Biography gives the date of his birth at 1540 (?). In the 1585 edition of his book, De morbo gallico, now extremely rare, Clowes tells us at the end of his ""Prayer"" the he was 41 in that year. The original manuscript of this prayer is now in the British Museum and confirms that the dated inscription was written by Clowes himself and was not altered by the printer to conform with the date of publication.The portrait in the Wellcome Museum is surmounted by a scroll with his name and the date 1543, but it must be remembered that year then began on March 25, so the last quarter of 1543 we should now call 1544. It therefore seems quite definite that Clowes was born early in 1544. 

We know nothing of his schooling, but if his apprenticeship was of the usual period of seven years, he must have come to London in 1556, at the age of twelve, in order to be admitted by the Barber-Surgeon's Company as apprentice to Master George Keble. Keble was a London surgeon who also practised ""physick"" and throughout his life, Clowes continued to use the ""...many excellent remedies..."", mostly ointments and plasters, the prescriptions of which he learned from his master at this time. Clowes must have been happy in his apprenticeship for he always wrote of Keble with gratitude and respect.  ""Sure Alexander the Great,"" he says, ""was never more bound to Aristotle his master for his lessons in philosophy than I was bound to him for giving me the first light and entrance into the knowledge of this noble are of surgery."" 

The most memorable event of these early years was the accession and coronation of Queen Elizabeth in 1558-9 and it was probably on this occasion, when he joined the other apprentices in the streets of the City to see the young Queen, that he first experienced the fervent patriotism and personal admiration for the Sovereign to which he so often gives expression in his writing. His own career was to run parallel with her reign, and her influence and interest was to be of great service to him in his profession. 

When his apprenticeship ended, in 1563, he became a surgeon in the Earl of Warwick's ill-fated army in Normandy. In the previous year, Elizabeth had signed a treaty with Conde, the leader of the French Huguenots, and had despatched this expedition to aid them in their struggle against the French King. 

Meanwhile, the rival parties in France, following the capture of Rouen by the Royalist troops, had come to terms and united to thrown out the English ""invaders"" beseiged in Le Havre. Plague and scurvy decmitated the troops, and storms in the Channel scattered the ships which attempted to bring food and reinforcements. It must have proved a good, if hard, training ground for the young surgeon, but Clowes tells us little of this campaign, except that he learned from it that fingers are the best of instruments, and that scabbards make good splints. 

Here, too, began his life-long friendship with John Banester, a fellow surgeon in the field wo was four years his senior, and for many years he kept by him the ""surger chest"", well fitted out and emblazoned with the Bear and Ragged Staff of Warwick's arms, with which he began his surgical career. Twenty-five years later, he had a drawing made of it for his book A Prooved Practice, but in the 1596 edition, this is replaced by the illustration of a new chest, decorated with the Royal coat of arms, which he probably acquired when he was appointed Surgeon to the Queen. 

In 1564, the ragged survivors of Warwick's army returned to England, but Clowes remainded at Portsmouth and served in the Queen's ships for a number of years. In 1569, he was made free of the Barber-Surgeon's Company, but he did not immediately begin to build up a civil practice, for in the following year, we find him still in the Navy and treating a wounded boatswain in the ship Aide while she was at anchor off the French coast. 

With years of experience in the Navy behind him, he was expert in treating the injuries and wounds which befall men on active service. He was also a specialist in the treatment of syphilis and, in 1576, he published a little book on this subject which carried his name to a wider circle. 

On March 16th of that year, he was elected a regular assistant to St. Bartholomew's Hospital and in the following year, 1577, he was one of four surgeons responsible for the re-publication of Thomas Vicary's book on anatomy. Although the other three, William Beton, Richard Stone, and Edward Bayley, were all his seniors, Clowes' name heads the list of signatures following the dedication, probably because he composed this epistle to the President and Governors of the hospital. 

Meanwhile, in January, 1576, he received an additional appointment as one of the surgeons to Christ's Hospital. The foundation for the children of the poor also took in sick children for treatment and occasionally adults were admitted. There were two visiting surgeons, of whom Clowes was now made one, and a resident ""Surgeon-Apothecary"". It is of some interest to those who believe the entry of women into medicine to be of recent date that at that time, the resident Surgeon-Apothecary was a certain Mrs. Cook. 

Henceforward, the Queen's favour was to have a decisive influence on his career. In 1581, he was promoted from assistant to full surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, but in March 1586 he resigned, ""...having been sent for by Her Majesty's commandment to go into the Low Countries to attend upon the Right Honourable Earl of Leicester, Lord Lieutenant and Captain General of Her Majesty's forces in those countries."" 

There was more than sufficient work for the surgeon, and as Clowes records, many perished from the attentions of the ""false"" surgeons who infested the camp before he had them thrown out. 

The campaign dragged on miserably. In December 1587, Leicester was recalled to face an inquiry, but Clowes had returned earlier in the year.

There could have been little enough time for literary work during this prolonged campaign, but in the following May, the title of Clowes' book. A Prooved Practice, was entered in the Stationer's Register. Before its actual publication two or three months later, its author found himself with a new honour and a fresh responsiblilty on his appointment as Surgeon to the Fleet which was being made ready to ward off the threatened Spanish invasion. 

The exact date when he took up the duties of this post is not known, but in the early stages it probably demanded organization and administration rather than actual service with the Fleet. 

On July 18th, he was admitted a member of the Court of Assistants (Council) of the Barber-Surgeons' Company, but this occasion may not have demanded a personal visit to their Hall in the City. Twelve days later, the Armada was sighted and, in accordance with his position, Clowes must have been aboard Howard's flagship, the Ark Royal. 

It is unfortunate that he has left us no personal record of the great battle which followed. By its very nature, he had few cases to deal with, but, as always in the 16th Century, epidemics broke out among the crews and the sad state of the sick and dying who were landed at Margate has been vividly described in letters which have been preserved among the State Papers. 

Clowes was released from duty in September and shortly afterwards was appointed ""one of the Queen's Chirurgeons."" He was now 44 years of age, in the front rank of his profession, a man of great experience in the wars, ""both by land and sea,"" and in carrying out the duties of his new office in the Company, was giving regular lectures on surgery to his junior colleagues at the Barber-Surgeons' Hall. His A Prooved Practice... was so successful, that a new edition was issued in 1591. In one of the Bishop's licenses, dated December 1594, and granded to one Thomas Hobbes, Surgeon, he (Clowes) is described as one of the ""Masters of the Mystery"" and examiners of the Surgeons of London. In the following year, his coat of arms, to which he had an hereditary right and which he had already reproduced on the back of the title page of the 1585 edition of his book on syphilis, was confirmed by Sir William Dethick, the Garter king-of-arms. His only son, also named William, who was to become Serjeant Surgeon to Charles I, began his apprenticeship with his father at about this time. 

 
Clowes' Family Crest and Coat of Arms 

Meanwhile, Clowes was at work enlarging and revising the text of his surgical casebook, and in 1596, this was re-published with the title A Profitable and Necessary Book of Observations. As a token of the Royal patronage which he enjoyed, the Royal coat of arms appears on the back of the title page. 

The work is dedicated ""To all the true professors of Chirurgerie in generall wheresoever, WILLIAM CLOWES wisheth all happiness, with much increase of knowledge in the are of Chirurgerie."" 

His last recorded appearance at the Barber-Surgeons' Hall was in December, 1596, and it is probably that very shortly afterwards, he took up his residence at Plaistow in Essex. This industrial suburb of London was, at that time, a pleasant country retreat, but it appears that Clowes carried on his practice there for, in his last book, the work on struma, published in 1602, he reports the case of a woman whom he treated in that same year. 
""She was dwelling,"" he says, ""in the County of Essex, three miles from my now dwelling house at Plasto, in the parish of Westham, within the said County."" 

This house, later to be known as Rokeby House, was in every way a suitable dwelling for the successful and prosperous surgeon who had retired to country practice. His coat of arms was elaborately carved on the handsome Tudor mantelpiece and when, within recent years, Rokeby House was demolished to make room for a cinema, this personal relic of the greatest of Elizabethan surgeons and fine example of Tudor craftsmanship was rescued intact and found its way to a Dublin museum. 

As a man, Clowes was typical of his age. Energetic, ambitious and self-confident, he was quickly angered but easily reconciled. His one constant foe was the quack, ""...by whom so many perish""; his one constant aim was the improvement of his profession for the ""...good of the country and common wealth wherein he was bred."" A devoted servant of the Queen, his patriotism was as genuine as his religious feeling.  By his untiring efforts and example, he showed himself worthy of remembrance, not only by the surgeon, but by the many who, at some time, find their lives depending on his skill.

Some copies are dated 1572. Certain individual works had first appeared in Bologna, 1564 and 1566, but they are here united (revised by the author) with others, for the first time. Three plates, depicting the base of an adult human skull, the body of a human foetus and the skeletal system of a child, are the earliest known in the fields of embryology and infantile anatomy, and were copied by Felix Platter in 1583, and Laurentius (du Laurens) in 1599. The treatise that accompanies these images is the earliest to compare adult, adolescent, and foetal anatomies and describe the point at which skeletal ossification begins. The present work established Coiter's reputation as the founder of comparative osteology. It was meant as a practical guide to medical students, as evidenced by the detailed engravings and also the synoptic tables, which describe the external and internal attributes of the human body, the ossification of the bones, and human vision each in great detail, giving both Greek and Latin terms and references from Hippocrates, Galen, and Aristotle. It also included the first monograph on the ear.

Volcher Coiter hailed from the Netherlands, but in line with the leading anatomists of his day he received medical training in Italy, moving between the influences of the most prominent teachers; Falloppio in Padua, Eustachi in Rome, and most significantly Aldrovandi in Bologna, where in 1562 he obtained his doctorate in medicine and began the present work. His treatise on embryology included here, and its reliance on an emerging interest in morbid dissection are particularly influenced by the Bologna School. But by 1566, Coiter was forced to leave Italy after imprisonment by the Inquisition for his Protestant beliefs. He continued work on osteology, and expanded his interests into avian anatomy on which he published significant comparative studies in 1569, while serving as physician to the city of Nuremberg. ""In his short life of forty-two years Coiter effected significant advances in biological knowledge"" DSB III, 342.
""Coiter was one of the first to draw the illustrations for his own publications-- his illlustrations of the adult skeleton and skull, after Vesalius, are superior in anatomical detail-- and his sketches of fetal skeletons are original"", Norman 496.
The plates are signed V.C.D. and were drawn by Coiter himself. Dryander also drew his own illustrations.","Riolan p. 7; Fuiren p. 6; van der Linden 2: 39; Barberini I: 285 (1572); Fr.

First edition, second issue (a few copies are dated 1572). One of the most important early anatomical books, comprising ten works, including three on general anatomy, two on the anatomy of the skeleton and foetal skeleton, and one on the egg of the chick, on comparative anatomy, on the eye, the ear, and finally miscellaneous observations which includes narratives of twelve autopsies. These works include the earliest study of the growth of the skeleton as a whole in the human foetus, the first description of the spinal ganglia and musculus corrrugtor supercilii, the first published study of the development of the chick embryo based on daily observation (which is also the first work on embryology since Aristotle), and the first monograph on the ear.
The tract on comparative anatomy is to be regarded as the first scientific work on the subject. “…the first to elevate this study to the rank of an independent branch of biology, is the Frisian Volcher Coiter, whose relevant works were published in 1572 [his tract on comparative osteology] and 1575” (Cole).
Coiter was one of the first anatomists to draw his own illustrations — all but two of the engravings are signed ‘V. C. D.’ for ‘Volcher Coiter delineavit’. The first two plates are four views of the skull, followed by two double-page plates of the skeleton of a child, two full page plates of adult skeletons after Vesalius (but more accurate in anatomical detail; see Herlinger pp. 128–130), and a double-page plate of the skeleton of a monkey.

It included 9 engravings (the first 4 on 2 leaves), all but 2 signed ""V. C. D."" for ""Volcher Coiter delineavit,"" signifying that they were drawn by the author. The last 2 plates, of the human skeleton, were designed after the first and third skeleton figures in Vesalius's Fabrica.  The woodcut historiated initials in the work were  from the ""Puttenalphabet"" by Hans Weiditz, cut in Augsburg in 1531. 
 
A student under Gabriele Falloppio, Bartoloemo Eustachi , and Ulisse Aldrovandi, Coiter made several important contributions to the study of human anatomy, and was the first to elevate comparative anatomy to the rank of an independent branch of biology. His Externarum et internarum principalium humani corporis partium tabulae is a collection of ten short works, among which are the first monograph on the ear (De auditus instrumento); the earliest study of the growth of the skeleton as a whole in the human fetus (Ossium tum humani foetus . . .); the first descriptions of the spinal ganglia and musculus corrugator supercilii (in Observationum anatomicarum chirurgicarumque miscellanea); and Coiter's epochal (although unillustrated) investigation of the development of the chick in ovo (De ovorum gallinaceorum generationis. . .), based upon observations made over twenty successive days. This last was the first published study of chick embryo development based upon direct observation since the three-period description (after three, ten and twenty days of incubation) given by Aristotle in his Historia animalium two thousand years before.
 
Coiter was one of the first physicians to draw the illustrations for his own publications, and to take credit for them in print. It is believed that Vesalius may have done some of the simpler illustrations for the Fabrica; however, none of the Fabrica images are signed, and questions concerning their authorship have led to centuries of speculation and debate. Coiter's illustrations of the adult skeleton and skull, after Vesalius, are superior in anatomical detail; and his sketches of fetal skeletons are original.
 
Cole, History of Comparative Anatomy, illustrates a copy of this work with the title-page dated 1572, but the majority of copies probably appeared in 1573, as most of the references cite the later date. Hook & Norman, The Haskell F. Norman Library of Science and Medicine (1991) no. 496.

Two issues of 1st edition exist with dedications either to Paul IV or Pius IV.  Colombo as well as Pope Paul died as the book was being completed.  Colombo's sons, Lazaro and Febo, replaced the original dedication with a new one to Pius IV, mentioning their father's recent death.  Colombo was present at the autopsy of St. Ignatius Loyola which is described.  It is here that Colombo defines his discovery of the pulmonary or lesser circulation, i.e., the passage of blood from the right cardiac ventricle to the left via the lungs. Included is the denial of pores in the interventricular septum.  Although ibn an-Nafis in the 13th century and Servetus had described this phenomenon, it was unknown to the world of anatomists.  The concept first appeared in print in 1556 in the work of Colombo's pupil Valverde. Colombo describes the duplications of the peritoneum, the ventricles of the larynx, and the mode of action of the pulmonary, cardiac, and aortic valves, clearing up a number of errors of his predecessors. Colombo, a friend of Michelangelo, was a pupil of Vesalius and later became his successor in the chair of anatomy at Padua. He is among the first to perform vivisection on dogs instead of hogs, for the reason that the latter were ""annoying by their squealing."" 
 ""Colombo's is best known for his discovery of the pulmonary or lesser circulation... Although overshadowed by his discovery of the pulmonary circulation, Colombo's observations of the heartbeat apparently directly inspired Harvey's vivisectional studies on the heart, which in turn led to his discovery of the greater circulation"" (Norman, 501).  His discoveries paved the way for William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of blood. Harvey studied in Padua some 50 years later.  Liber VIII/XV deals with the nervous system.

Initials of Jean Blondelet on rear pastedown.,"His contributions to anatomy and medicine included the following observations:  the lens lies to the front of the eyeball, not in the centre; arteries expand with each heartbeat; the pulmonary valve of the heart closes during diastole, preventing reflux; blood flows from the right side of the heart through the lungs.  The book was also known for describing the clitoris, which he called the ""love or sweetness of Venus,"" and which he claimed to have discovered. This claim was disputed by Gabriel Fallopius, who claimed that he had discovered it. Both claims were later dismissed by Casper Bartholin, who stated that the clitoris had been widely known to anatomists since the second century AD.  
Catholic Encyclopedia:  Italian anatomist and discoverer of the pulmonary circulation, b. at Cremona in 1516; d. at Rome, 1559. He studied medicine at Padua with Vesalius, became his assistant, and in 1544 his successor as lecturer on surgery and anatomy. In 1545 Cosimo de'Medici, who was reorganizing the University of Pisa, held out such inducements to Colombo that he became the first professor of anatomy there. Colombo occupied this post until 1548, when he received a call to the chair of anatomy in the Papal University at Rome. This he held until his death. During all his years of teaching at Padua, Pisa, and Rome, he continued to make original researches in anatomy. The results of his investigation were published under the title, ""De Re Anatomicâ Libri XV"" (Venice, 1559). The most important feature of this book is an accurate and complete description of the pulmonary circulation. Colombo say: ""The blood is carried by the artery-like vein to the lungs, and being there made thin is brought back thence together with air by the vein-like artery to the left ventricle of the heart."" Colombo know that this was an original observation, for he adds: ""This fact no one has hitherto observed or recorded in writing; yet, it may be most readily observed by any one."" Harvey, in his work, ""On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals"", quotes Colombo more than once and gives him credit for many original observations in anatomy. Apparently lest there should be any diminution of Harvey's glory, English writers on the history of medicine have, as a rule, failed to give Colombo the credit which he deserves and which Harvey so readily accorded him. Colombo made as many as fourteen dissections in one year at Rome. Several hundred people sometimes attended his anatomical demonstrations, and cardinals, archbishops, and other high ecclesiastics were often present. Colombo is famous as a teacher of anatomy and physiology, and first used living animals to demonstrate various functions, especially the movements of the heart and lungs. He said one could learn more in an hour in this way than in three months from Galen. His book was dedicated to Pope Paul IV, of whom he was an intimate personal friend.

Cornarius (or Hagenbut, 1500-58), a native of Zwickau, was, according to Hirsch, one of the most passionate and meritorious of the 16th century medical philologists. He edited and translated many Greek medical texts, including Dioscorides and Aetius as well as contributing to the great Basel editions of Hippocrates and Galen. These works show the author's preference for Greek medicine over the Arab medical tradition.  Cornarius took his medical degree at Wittenberg and traveled widely including Scandinavia, England, and France. In 1530 he returned to his native town where he established a medical practice and finally became professor of medicine at Marburg and Jena. While living in Basel (1528-30), Cornarius came to know Erasmus who was much impressed with his achievements. 

Cornarius had a controversy with Fuchs???  Cornarius was included in the Index of 1564.  Waller 4488 a Hippocratic work edited by Cornarius has Vesalius' signature on the title page although the two were at odds since Cornarius was an ardent Galenist.

Council of Trent (1545-1563): Pope Paul III (1534-1549); Pope Julius III (1550-1555);  Pope Pius IV (1559-1565).  The northern Italian city of Trent was the venue of an ecumenical council at three meetings held in 1545-9, 1551-2 & 1562-3. It helped to define more precisely the doctrines of the Roman Church in opposition to those of the Reformation. This is evident in the Council's rejection of the Protestant views on original sin and in the reaffirmati on of the doctrine of transubstantiation. Although papal autocracy was strengthened since the Council depended on the Pope's consent to validate decrees, the Council ultimately secured the future spiritual efficiency of the Roman Church, as when provision was made for the establishment of seminaries for the training of the clergy in every diocese.

In addition to the half page woodcuts of neurosurgical procedures done in period settings and costumes, numerous instruments such as a hand held trephine are illustrated.

Iowa: Not a great deal is known of Croce's life. He was born at Venice, is known to have been a member of the College of Surgeons there, and about 1560 is mentioned as being one of the city's most successful surgeons. The present work is Croce's major contribution and is chiefly an historical compilation of the writings of the important authorities from Hippocrates to Albucasis. Croce's recommendations for wound management are surprisingly modern and are similar to some of those used during the early years of this century. Noteworthy in his Chirurgiae are the many excellent illustrations that appear throughout the text. Nearly all of the best known and most frequently used surgical instruments are depicted in historical sequence. The various types of arrows, spears, and bullets used in the warfare of his day are also illustrated as well as several scenes of the typical operating room of the sixteenth century. Croce's work went through several editions and was also translated into German and Italian.

Second Italian edition. First printed (in Latin) in 1573, the first Italian edition was in 1574. This fine surgical compendium covers numerous diseases and surgical procedures, the history of surgical instruments from ancient to ""modern"" 16th century ones. In three large woodcuts, we see the first depictions of neurological operations in the form of cerebral trephination. Of particular note are the various animals present in the operating room; dogs, cats and rats roam freely around the floor. Among the diseases mentioned are gonorrhea and the ""mal francese"" or the French disease, also known as syphilis. The chapter in which this appears ends with a mercurial treatment, and some contemporary Italian marginalia. The penultimate leaf contains two spectacular woodcuts, both showing the method of extracting an arrow from the breast, as performed by Christian army doctors, the other as done by the Turkish. ""Croce improved the instruments for trephination, and published classic woodcuts depicting the operation, including the first illustration of a neurological surgery operation actually taking place. The work is also important for Croce’s descriptions of cranial and cerebral diseases. In hundreds of woodcuts of instruments and procedures Croce illustrated all of the instruments used before and during his own time."" [Garrison & Morton]. ""Not a great deal is known of Croce’s life. He was born at Venice, is known to have been a member of the College of Surgeons there, and about 1560 is mentioned as being one of the city’s most successful surgeons. [Chirurgiae 1573] is Croce’s major contribution and is chiefly an historical compilation of the writings of the important authorities from Hippocrates to Abulcasis. Croce’s recommendations for wound management are surprisingly modern and are similar to some of those used during the early years of [the 20th] century. Noteworthy in his Chirurgiae are the many excellent illustrations that appear throughout the text. Nearly all of the best known and most frequently used surgical instruments are depicted in historical sequence. The various types of arrows, spears, and bullets used in the warfare of his day are also illustrated as well as several scenes of the typical operating room of the sixteenth century.""

First edition of this excessively rare book, which is one of the earliest printed medical incunabula known. The anonymous printer, whose modern nickname is derived from the peculiar majuscule R, is now generally identified with Adolf Rusch, of Ingweiler, Mentelin's son-in-law, who was printing at Strasburg from 1464 till after 1480, in which year he finished his large four-volume Biblia cum glosa ordinaria, with types borrowed from John Amerbach, for the great Nuremberg publisher, Anton Kobergher. After Mentelin's death in 1479 he succeeded to his business. About 1478 his type 103 is supposed to have passed to Michael Greyff, of Heutligen, and Rusch's work after 1479 must be mainly represented by some of the books in his type 100. In the last years of his life he seems to have been mainly a paper dealer. In his Incunabula Medica, Bib. Soc., 1923, 8ir W. Osler writes of this work : "" Towards the close of our period [1480], from the press of the R printer at Strasbourg, a fine folio known as the Aggregator, for which no book ever received a more appropriate title. There still appear in the medical profession dictionaries of treatment which are called for by doctors who do the penny-in-the-slot business and have so many remedies for each disease and each symptom. As it is the first, so also is the Aggregator the best of its kind, with fine type on fine paper and a larger number of remedies for each symptom than has since appeared in any work. The author was one Giacomo Dondi, Jacobus Paduanus lie calls himself, who was born in 1298 and died in 1359. A mathematician of note, he was also the first great horologist after Richard of Wallingford, whom he surpassed in the construction of the great clock of Padua. The work suggests great industry, and it is a book from which one can get long lists of the mediaeval medicines."" The book retains its original lettering slip and press mark pasted on the front cover. Inserted at beginning and end is a portion of two leaves of an ancient theological manuscript, probably of the tenth or early eleventh century.","First edition of this important herbal and pharmacological work, one of the earliest printed books with an exclusively medical content; the recipes are largely based on Greek and Arabic sources. This is a magnificent copy — crisp, large, and rubricated — in its first binding from the Episcopal Court Library at Eichstätt. 

Earlier references list this as ca. 1470 and give Mentelin as the printer. Adolf Rusch and Martin Schott were Mentelin's sons-in-law.  This printer is now generally identified with Adolf Rusch of Ingeweiler, who married Johann Mentelin's daughter Salome and is said to have succeeded to Mentelin's printing business. In this copy the capital letters, initial-strokes and paragraph marks have been supplied in red. 

Dondis (1295-1359), a native of Padua, was the municipal physician of Chioggia, a coastal town near Venice and later became professor of medicine at Padua. Dondis was also a mechanician who designed a complicated automatic clock for his native town; it was certainly one of the earliest tower clocks. Astronomy was another area in which Dondis worked; he wrote a work entitled Planetarium, a set of astronomical tables based on the Alphonsine ones but simpler and computed for the meridian of Padua. 

Dondis’ “most extensive work was the Aggregatio medicamentorum, or Promptuarium medicinae, a work which contains a large collection of medical recipes based largely on Greek and Arabic sources. It is divided into four main sections: (1) impostumes (37 chapters), (2) contusions and fractures (8 chapters), (3) wounds (12 chapters), (4) ulcers and abscesses (20 chapters). The work was completed after 1358.”–Sarton, III, p. 1670. 

This was a most successful work with a number of later editions. The Italian translation appeared under the title Herbolario volgare (eds. of 1536 and 1540).

FIRST EDITION. Giacomo de Dondi, municipal physician at Chioggia, was a versatile scholar and craftsman whose contributions ranged from horology and astronomy to balneology, a discipline that he is said to have founded. The Aggregator(also referred to as the Aggregatio medicamentorum or the Promptuarium medicamentorum), his most extensive work, completed ca 1358, is an encyclopaedic manual of medical recipes compiled from Greek and Arabic sources. The recipes, listed alphabetically, are classified in four sections devoted to different medical conditions: abscesses (37 chapters), contusions and fractures (8 chapters), wounds (12 chapters), and ulcers (20 chapters). Although seldom cited in the standard herbal bibliographies, the work is in fact an early precursor of the herbals (later editions, all published in Venice, included several 16th-century illustrated condensed versions in Italian under the title Herbolario volgare). IT IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST PRINTED TEXTS OF EXCLUSIVELY MEDICAL CONTENT.

The traditional dating of this edition to circa 1470 is erroneous. No date earlier than 1473 can be substantiated for any of the editions from the so-called ""R-Press"", which may be identified with Johannes Mentelin and/or his son-in-law Adolf Rusch. The Royal folios produced at this anonymous press show no paper stocks in use before 1473. The present copy includes papers watermarked with 7-petalled flower (Briquet 6557 and 6573), 9-petalled flower (Briquet 6620), and grapes (Briquet 13049), none of which is noted earlier than 1473. The identification of the printer as Adolf Rusch is based on a letter dated 11 February 1478 from the city council of Lubeck to that of Strasbourg, concerning the loan of a manuscript of Vincent de Beauvais's Speculum doctrinale as copytext (cf. BMC I:59, footnote). The edition (Goff V-278=V-279) was printed in R-Press type 2:100, a semi-gothic type resembling Mentelin's 8:107 and appearing only in works datable to circa 1475-1478. Although Victor Scholderer states that Mentelin was not involved in the printing of the Speculum doctrinale, the letter does not in fact clearly establish Rusch as a printer independent of his father-in-law. It is most likely that all of the R-Press type 2 editions were printed by the two in partnership.

The tools employed on the binding of this copy are not reproduced in Kyriss, Verzierte gotische Einbnde or Schunke,Schwenke-Sammlung.

An expanded second edition was published in 1551. The present edition combines the 2 earlier works. Later editions appeared in 1557 and 1580. Although not as useful as one would hope, it represents the first Italian bibliography first published 5 years after Gesner.

Dryander (also known as Eichmann) was one of he first authors to make drawings of his own dissections.  This is the first significant work devoted to the anatomy of the brain.  The first eleven plates, which first were published in 1536, depict the brain dissected according to Galen's method of starting at the top and making horizontal cuts through the skull and brain.  The work also contains four plates of the heart, chest and lungs.  Roberts and Tomlinson attribute the plates to Georg Thomas of Basil. A short work by Gabriele de Zerbis (1445-1505) on the anatomy of the fetus is also included.  The woodcut title-border is by Anton Woensam von Worms and shows the deeds of Hercules and Pyramus and Thisbe.  It was also used by Cervicornus for Dryander's edition of Abraham Ibn Ezra in 1537.

RCPE:  Dryander, also known as Eichmann, was professor of surgery at Marburg, and a friend of Vesalius. He was ""among the first anatomists who made illustrations after their own dissections"" (Choulant). The above work includes twenty plates, the first sixteen representing figures of the head and brain, and done to show successive stages of dissection. The last four show the chest and lungs. Also included is a short tract on the anatomy of the pig, traditionally attributed to Copho, and extracts from Zerbis, professor at Padua, on the anatomy of the fetus.
Dryander, who studied anatomy at Paris at the same time as Vesalius, produced in his Anatomia capitis one of the most important pre-Vesalian anatomical studies, showing by means of full-page woodcuts how he learned to dissect and display human anatomy. He was one of the first physicians in Germany to perform public dissections, and the text of Anatomia capitis is the printed record of an anatomical demonstration he gave at Marburg. Anatomia capitis was probably published in a small edition, as Dryander intended it to serve as the preliminary to a full-scale anatomy.
 
This scheme Dryander partially realized the following year when he issued his Anatomia, hoc est corporis humani dissectionis pars prior. That expanded work included 36 leaves and 19 full-age woodcuts, plus a woodcut title border. Eight of the woodcuts (one of which is repeated) are repetitions of illustrations 1-8 in the 1536 Anatomia, with the illustration numbers removed from the blocks. Another 8 woodcuts (one, Universalis figura capitis humani, repeated) are new to this work; 3 of them are signed with the monogrammed compass device used in the 1536 edition. In addition, there are 3 illustrations made up of images rearranged from illustrations 9, 10 and 11 of the 1536 Anatomia.

The text expands upon Dryander's Anatomia capitis humani, published the previous year; here he explores the anatomy of the head in greater detail and includes new material on the lungs and heart, as well as the 12th-century Anatomia porci, traditionally ascribed to Copho (fl. ca. 1110) and first printed in Lyon in 1523, and excerpts from the Anatomia infantis by Gabriele de Zerbis (1445-1505), a treatise on the anatomy of the foetus. The woodcuts consist of 13 full-page illustrations of the head and brain, of which 11 reprinted from the Anatomia capitis with the numbers removed from the woodblocks, the remaining two full-page skull cuts, both dated 1536, being new to this edition; 4 small detail cuts of the skull seen from different angles, also reprinted from the earlier work; and 4 large new cuts of the chest and lungs (one dated 1537). Three of the new woodcuts as well as five of the previously used cuts are signed with the compass and G device, which have been ascribed to either the school of Hans Brosamer or the engraver Georg Thomas. 


Gaskell-Pagel 09: This famous work on the anatomy of the head is one of the most important illustrated anatomical treatises before Vesalius. It is one of the first monographs on a single part of the body, one of the first illustrated anatomies, and the illustrations are, with those of Berengario, the best that were published before Vesalius’ Fabrica in 1543 (Lind p. 297). Dryander performed some of the earliest dissections in Germany and was one of the first anatomists to make illustrations after his own dissections. This edition was intended to be the first part of a complete illustrated anatomy, but the project was abandoned. Despite accusing Dryander of plagiarism, in works printed in 1541 and 1542, Vesalius himself copied Dryander’s illustrations of dissections of the head.
The text expands that of the 1536 Anatomia capitis humani, exploring the anatomy of the head in greater detail, and including new material on the lungs and heart as a preliminary to the larger treatise that never appeared (hence the ‘pars prior’ in the title). Also included is the 12th-century Anatomia porci, traditionally ascribed to Copho (fl. ca. 1110) and first printed at Lyon in 1523, and excerpts from the Anatomia infantis by Gabriele de Zerbis (1445-1505), a treatise on the anatomy of the foetus.
Born at Wetter in Oberhessen, Johannes Eichmann, or Dryander as he is usually known, took his MA at Erfurt in 1518 and studied at Bourges and at Paris between 1528 and 1533, at the same time that Vesalius was there.
The woodcuts consist of 13 full-page illustrations of the head and brain, of which 11 were reprinted from the Anatomia capitis with the numbers removed from the woodblocks, the remaining two full-page skull cuts, both dated 1536, being new to this edition; four small detail cuts of the skull seen from different angles, also reprinted from the earlier work; and four large new cuts of the chest and lungs, one dated 1537.
The blockcutter of the new woodcuts, as well as five of the previously used cuts, signs himself with the initial G with a pair of compasses, or sometimes G V B, or V B only. The initials G V B have been associated with Georg Thomas of Basle – the pair of compasses is the symbol of the apostle Thomas (Herlinger).
This is an unusually large and complete copy: the woodcuts are almost always cropped, and the printed table often lacking.

These include blocks first used in Dryander’s Anatomiae (1537); his Anatomia Mundini (1541); and works by other authors, as well as some new cuts. There are a number of sickroom and childbirth scenes, and large and small woodcuts illustrating anatomy, obstetrics and gynaecology, health and diet (many foodstuffs are shown, and a scene of a gardener tending his vegetables in a raised bed) and surgery. The surgery section includes cuts copied from Gersdorff, Feltbuch der Wundtartzney (Strasbourg, 1517) and a large number of illustrations of surgical instruments.
‘Twenty-three of the leaves, some of them with several figures, are plates taken from the above-mentioned book [Anatomia Mundini]. Two sheets are entirely new and represent (1) a figure, showing the vascular system, with heart and liver, and (2) a figure showing the cutaneous veins of the back (leaves 7 and 8). On pages 70b and 86, we, furthermore, find five smaller figures representing the brain and the tongue. These figures are the same as those of Laurentius, Phryesen, Spiegel der Artzney, Strasburg, 1518, fol., but are positively new engravings [i.e. woodcuts]. A great many other figures are nonanatomic, and were probably all done by Hans Brosamer.

Dryander’s practice of medicine is one of the first general works on medicine to include a series of woodcuts based on dissection. Dryander, fellow-student in Paris with Vesalius, and professor of medicine at Marburg, carried out some of the earliest public dissections in Germany. Based on these, he issued his celebrated and excessively rare Anatomia Capitis Humani in 1536, the first work on the anatomy of the head, and his Anatomiae, hoc est, Corporis Humani Dissectionis in 1537, which repeated and expanded on the 1536 work (see Garrison-Morton 370–71). For his 1542 Artzenei he re-issued the key woodcuts showing dissection of the brain from the two previous works, as well as other woodcuts he had used, based on Berengario primarily, and his own dissections. There are two entirely new woodcuts in the Artzenei, both full-page, one of which fuses in a single diagram the two vascular plates from Vesalius’s Tabulae Sex published in 1538. Vesalius complained bitterly about this in the Fabrica in 1543; however, Herrlinger (85) points out that in some cases Vesalius’s own illustrations are taken from Dryander, albeit with improvements. Numerous other woodcuts illustrate text on food and drink, materia medica, and medical treatment. Choulant/Frank 148–49, & 132, noting that Dryander also drew on the remarkable woodcuts in Phryesen’s Spiegel der Artzny (Strassburg, 1518); in fact in his preface, Dryander states that his book is meant to update the earlier Phryesen.

Antoine du Verdier (1544 – 25 September 1600), lord of Vauprivast, was a French politician and writer.

Du Verdier was born in Montbrison, Loire. He was conseiller du roi and controller-general in Lyon, but is best known for his work as a bibliographer alongside his friend and contemporary François Grudé.

The MacCarthy-Reagh Catalogue No. 1907 describes a copy on vellum and richly colored, perhaps the copy at the Bibliothèque Nationale.  Another colored copy was shown at the Grolier Club's exhibition of books from the Library of Duke August of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1998. The present copy is as large as the Weil copy from 1956 and the Norman copy.  This probably represents the original maximum size.  It is unpressed and in original or early boards with green silk ties.

Charles Estienne, third son of the printer Henri I Estienne, studied botany, horticulture, and classical philology before concentrating exclusively on medicine. From 1544 to 1547 he held the post of lecturer in anatomy at the Faculté de Médecine in Paris; during this same period his stepfather Simon de Colines carried out the printing of both the Latin and French editions of this anatomy, his major scientific work. Estienne was later obliged to give up his medical practice in order to manage the family printing business, but he continued to edit and compile scientific texts in such diverse areas as diet, zoology, philology, and rural economy.
The illustrations include a group of 38 cuts in books II and III in which the anatomical depictions of the internal organs are printed from separate pieces inserted into the larger blocks showing male or female figures. The sensual nature of the poses of the female figures in Book III has led to the speculation that the blocks may have been copied from a series of erotic engravings by Gian Giacomo Caraglio after drawings by Perino del Vaga, while the male figures in Book II, showing corpses reclining against trees and masonry, may be based on a series of unpublished drawings by Giovanni Battista Rosso. The insets are believed to be the work of Etienne de la Rivière.

The bulk of the work was completed by 1539, when printing was interrupted by a lawsuit brought by de la Rivière, who accused Estienne of plagiarizing one of his manuscripts and of claiming exclusive credit for the work. The dispute dragged on for six years -- during which time Vesalius published the first edition of the Fabrica -- until it was finally resolved by a special commission of doctors and surgeons appointed by the Parlement, resulting in a parliamentary judgement in March 1545 ordering Estienne to include de la Rivière's name on the title, and obliging the latter to hand over the remainder of the outstanding illustrations and reimburse Estienne for the expenses incurred by the litigation.

This delay in publication was significant, for it permanently obscured the importance of Estienne's work. Not only was his treatise the first printed book to illustrate in its entirety the external venous and nervous systems, but it reaffirmed before Vesalius the empirical principle formulated by Berengario of the necessity of basing the study of anatomy on the physician's observations of his own dissections. It was in fact the ""first work to show detailed illustrations of dissection in serial progression, the first to discuss and illustrate the whole human body, the first to publish instructions on how to mount a skeleton, and the first to set the anatomical figures in a fully developed panoramic landscape, a tradition begun by Berengario da Carpi in his Commentaria"" (Norman p. 262). The fact that most of the illustrations seem to have been completed by the mid-1530s supports the view that Vesalius was influenced by Estienne's work, which he would have seen during his stay in Paris in 1533-36 (cf. Herrlinger p. 87). Other original contributions of De dissectione, not featured in the Fabrica, include descriptions of the morphology and function of the ""feeding holes"" of bones, the three-part composition of the sternum, and the most detailed early illustrations of brain dissections.

The illustrations include a group of 38 cuts in books II and III in which the anatomical depictions of the internal organs are printed from separate pieces inserted into the larger blocks showing male or female figures. The sensual nature of the poses of the female figures in Book III has led to the speculation that the blocks may have been copied from a series of erotic engravings by Gian Giacomo Caraglio after drawings by Perino del Vaga, while the male figures in Book II, showing corpses reclining against trees and masonry, may be based on a series of unpublished drawings by Giovanni Battista Rosso. The insets are believed to be the work of Etienne de la Rivière.

Edell: FIRST EDITION OF THE FINEST ANATOMICAL WORK OF THE FRENCH RENAISSANCE, WITH EXOTIC IMAGES UNIQUE IN THE HISTORY OF ANATOMICAL ART. Charles Estienne, son of Henri Estienne, the founder of the French dynasty of scholar-printers, studied medicine in Paris, completing his training in 1540. In 1535, during his course of anatomical studies under Jacobus Sylvius, Estienne had Andreas Vesalius as a classmate. At the time the only illustrated manuals of dissection available were the writings of Berengario da Carpi, and the need for an improved, well-illustrated manual must have been obvious to all students of anatomy, particularly the medical student son of one of the world's leading publishers. Estienne did not hesitate to fill this need. The manuscript and illustrations for De Dissectione were completed by 1539, and the book was set in type halfway through Book 3 and the last section, when publication was stopped by a lawsuit brought by Etienne de la Rivière, an obscure surgeon and anatomist who had attended lectures at the Paris faculty during 1533-1536, overlapping the time of Estienne's medical study in Paris. The printing work was done at the Estienne Press by Charles Estienne's stepfather Simon de Colines, who ran the press from Henri Estienne's death until Charles's brother Robert came of age. According to the account of Quesnay, Estienne may have attempted to plagiarize a manuscript of Rivière which the latter had turned over to him for translation from French into Latin. In the eventual settlement of the lawsuit, Estienne was required to credit Rivière for the various anatomical preparations, and for the pictures of the dissections.

The anatomical woodcuts in De Dissectione have attracted much critical attention due to their wide variation in imagistic quality, the oddly disturbing postures of the figures in Books 2 and 3, the obvious insertion in many blocks (again, in Books 2 and 3) of separately cut pieces for the dissected portions of the anatomy, and the uncertainty surrounding the sources of the images. The presence of inserts in main blocks would suggest that these blocks were originally intended for another purpose, and in fact a link has been established between the gynecological figures in Book 3, with their frankly erotic poses, and the series of prints entitled Gli amori degli dei, engraved by Gian Giacomo Caraglio after drawings by Perino del Vaga and Rosso Fiorentino. A possible explanation of this interesting connection between pornography and anatomy is that the engraver of the female nude woodcuts did not have access to a model, and for the sake of expediency copied the general outlines of the female nudes from ""The Loves of the Gods,"" eliminating the male figures from the erotic illustrations. Another wood engraver, perhaps Rivière, would then have prepared the anatomical insert blocks showing the internal organs. Still another explanation might have been that in an era in which there was little graphic erotica available the author and the publishers deliberately exploited the erotic undercurrents of this anatomical work as a way of expanding the market beyond medical students. Perhaps because of the erotic undertones the book sold unusually well for a dissection manual and anatomical textbook, causing the publishers to issue an edition in French only one year later, in 1546.

Had De Dissectione been published in 1539, it would have stolen much of the thunder from Vesalius's Fabrica (1543): it would have been the first work to show detailed illustrations of dissection in serial progression, the first to discuss and illustrate the total human body, the first to publish instructions on how to mount a skeleton, and the first to set the anatomical figures in a fully developed panoramic landscape, a tradition begun by Berengario da Carpi. Nonetheless, Estienne's work still contained numerous original contributions to anatomy, including the first published illustrations of the whole external venous and nervous systems, and descriptions of the morphology and purpose of the ""feeding holes"" of bones, the tripartate composition of the sternum, the valvulae in the hepatic veins and the scrotal septum. In addition, the work's eight dissections of the brain give more anatomical detail that had previously appeared.

Plates apparently engraved by Geoffrey Tory, five have his cross of Lorraine mark.  Most of the large plates were completed by 1539, but the publication of the book was delayed because of a suite between Estienne and the surgeon Estienne de la Rivière.  The two editions are the fourth and fifth illustrated anatomy works to be published, two by Berengario, the Fabrica of Vesalius being the only complete earlier ones.  Dryander's book was never completed and Hundt was not an anatomy text.  Charles Estienne was the younger son of Henri Estienne I.  The translation was done by Estienne himself.  Printed by Simon de Colines the stepfather of Charles Estienne who ran the Estienne press from the death of Henri I until Charles' brother Robert came of age.  This edition contains 2 plates of skeletons not present in the 1545 edition on A6r and A7r. There are 64 full page woodcuts (58 blocks with 6 repeats) of which 39 contain anatomical insets in the woodblocks.  It is printed throughout in italic type unlike the Latin edition.  This copy is among the tallest recorded.  Ruled in red throughout with all edges gilded and many deckled edges.
 It was the most costly book to leave the press of Simon de Colines, who was Estienne’s stepfather and the finest printer in France at the time. This book was the first published work to include illustrations of the whole external venous and nervous systems. It includes good descriptions of the clavicular joints, temporo-maxillary articulation, and the joints and ligaments of the spine, but the book excels in neurology for containing the earliest detailed illustrations of brain dissections. “His eight dissections of the brain, made in 1539, give more anatomical detail than had previously appeared, particularly the first graphical presentation of the difference between the convolutional patterns of the cerebrum and cerebellum” (McHenry).

Although this work was published two years after Vesalius’s Fabrica, it is pre-Vesalian as Estienne had begun composing it long before, possibly as early as 1530 (see below). The printing was interrupted for six years in 1539 by a lawsuit brought by the artist Etienne de La Rivière. This French edition (which, incidentally, is considerably rarer than the Latin one) is preferable for containing two full-page woodcuts which were not included in the Latin edition, bringing the total of full-page woodcuts to 64. One of the two new cuts is the famous skeleton cut on p. 13, signed by Mercure Jollat, who has also signed another eight blocks, some of which are dated 1530, 1531, or 1532. Six of the Jollat blocks and one other are also signed with the Cross of Lorraine, possibly indicating an artist from the atelier of Geofroy Tory. The first cut is signed with the initials S.R. — Stephanus Riverus, or Etienne de La Rivière, the eminent surgeon who collaborated with Charles Estienne on the drawings for the anatomical details.KELLETT CE.

""This valuable Greek-Latin dictionary for the ancient medical writers defined and fixed a large number of anatomical terms, and exercised considerable influence on modern anatomical terminology. It was an important aid to the full understanding of the ancient texts."" ""The central portion of the dictionary, arranged alphabetically, is taken from the works of Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Galen, Oribasius, Rufus of Ephesus, Aëtius of Amida, Alexander Trallianus, Paulus Aegineta, Actuarius, and Celsus and is followed by excerpts in Greek with Latin translations or definitions from Galen, Rufus of Ephesus, and Pollux. Also included are Erotianus's Greek text of Lexicon in Hippocratem with annotations by Estienne and Gesner; the Greek text of Galen's Linguarum .. Hippocratis Explicatio; and selections in Greek from the Lexicon Herodoteum and from the De Dialectis by Gregorius, Metropolitan of Corinth; and extracts from various writings of Galen"" (Heirs of Hippocrates 361). The work was produced in Geneva with the financial backing of Ulrich Fugger (1526-1584, and was compiled in collaboration with Conrad Gesner according to Goldschmidt (Cat. 144) and Wellisch 60.

 ","Third edition of this early church history by possibly the first native-born Italian printer. Issued with the dedication to Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville, the other issue with a dedication to Sixtus IV. (The first two editions were printed in Utrecht in 1474 and in Strasbourg in about 1475 respectively.) 

A cleric of the 4th century, Eusebius was the author of several religious works that have survived and shaped Catholic tradition. ""Eusebius' many learned publications are a history of martyrs and several apologetic and polemical works; parts of his commentaries on the Psalms and Isaiah...But Eusebius' chief fame rests on The History of the Christian Church, the most important ecclesiastical history of the ancient times, and a great treasury of knowledge about the early Church"" (Loeb). A chronological account of the development of Early Christianity, ""this was the first full length historical narrative written fårom the Christian point of view,"" and it remains an important primary source for Catholic historians (Norman).

Often called the ""Father of Church History,"" the famous bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (ca. 260 - ca. 340) was a friend and adviser of the emperor Constantine and a prolific writer of history and scriptural commentary. He is best known for three works: his epitome of universal history (covering the period from apostolic times to 324), his ""Historia Ecclesiastica"" (the first history of the Christian church).

","Johannes Philippus de Lignamine (1420 – ??) was a Sicilian printer/publisher and tax collector from Messina active at Monte Cassino near Rome and a courtier to Pope Sixtus IV. He is best known for his publication of Herbarium Apuleii Platonici in 1481.[1] the first illustrated herbal.  pseudo-APULEIUS PLATONICUS. Herbarium Apulei. [Rome:] Johannes Philippus de Lignamine, [c.1481-82].  He is often cited as a physician which would make him the first to be involved in printing.

De Vinne & Dyson Perrins refers to him as a papal physician to Sixtus IV, but this is not mentioned by other writers.  On addition to the first illustrated herbal,  Lignamine also published an early edition of De conservatione sanitatis.  

 
While Italy was the first country to use Johannes Gutenberg's new printing techniques, it was also the first country in which the German monopoly of the printing industry was lost. On 3 August 1470 the Institutio Oratoria, a book by Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (AD30-AD96) was typeset on an Italian press operated by Johannes Philippus de Lignamine. This first edition was edited by Giovanni Antonio Campani and was based on a corrupt copy of the manuscript found by Poggio Bracciolini.[2]


Research by Margaret M. Smith concluded that de Lignamine was the first printer to use small capitals.[3][4].  The printer of the 1479 Mantua edition was the physician Johann Schall.  This book has been cited as the first printed book to have catchwords on every page.

Preparation for the Gospel (Greek: Εὐαγγελικὴ προπαρασκευή, Euangelikē proparaskeuē), commonly known by its Latin title Praeparatio evangelica, was a work of Christian apologetics written by Eusebius in the early part of the fourth century AD. It was begun about the year 313,[1] and attempts to prove the excellence of Christianity over pagan religions and philosophies. It was dedicated to Bishop Theodotus of Laodicea.[2]

The Preparation for the Gospel is a significant work by Eusebius Caesariensis (AD 260/265 Ð 339/340), who is best known for writing the first surviving history of the Christian Church as a chronologically-ordered account, complete from the time of the Apostles to his own time. The Preparation is an introduction to Christianity for pagans, in which the author attempts to prove the excellence of Christianity over pagan religion and philosophy. Its fifteen books have been completely preserved. For later readers, it is of particular value because it contains added information from historians and philosophers which is not available elsewhere, including excerpts from the writings of Porphyry, the Phoenician priest Sanchunianthon, the Platonist philosopher Atticus and the Middle Platonist philosopher Numenius of Apamea","Single column, 45 lines plus headline in roman type. Translated by Georgius Trapezuntius (1396-1486); edited by Hieronymus Bononius (Bologni, Girolamo, 1454-1517).  Rubricated in red throughout, three- to 10-line Lombard initials painted in red.  Described by the Catholic Encyclopedia as ""a gigantic feat of erudition,"" Eusebius' ""Preparation for the Gospels"" is valued as a repository of information on paganism, preserving many extracts from classical authors that would otherwise be lost to us. Often called the ""Father of Church History,"" the famous bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (ca. 260 - ca. 340) was a friend and adviser of the emperor Constantine and a prolific writer of history and scriptural commentary. He is best known for three works: his epitome of universal history (covering the period from apostolic times to 324), his ""Historia Ecclesiastica"" (the first history of the Christian church), and the present item, a collection of knowledge and quotations from classical writers intended to prepare the mind to receive the evidences of Christianity. Composed by Eusebius during the period of the Great Persecution just prior to the legalization of Christianity, the ""Historia"" addresses an audience of learned and pious readers hesitating to embrace Christianity, and it assures them that the truth is manifest in Scripture, while the pagan schools incessantly contradict one another. The first half of the work systematizes pagan religion and mythology as well as the doctrines of the philosophical schools and goes on to recognize the similarities of Platonic and Christian beliefs, arguing that Plato's view of the Demiurge was derivative and based on a knowledge of the Hebrew Pentateuch. First printed in 1470 by Nicolas Jenson, the present work was edited by Girolamo Bologni (Latinized Hieronymus Bononius) (1454-1517), a well-known jurist, poet, and humanist. According to BMC, our printer, Michael Mazolus, was active in Treviso between 1476-81, after which time he was mainly engaged as a publisher in Venice. ","Heinsius Theol F186 (1544); Fr.

Eusebius' famous work that compares the religion and philosophy of the Greeks to the religion of the Hebrews. He compares Moses with Plato and through this comparison asserts the superiority of Moses and Judaism. This work is also valued for Eusebius' 'copious extracts' from the works of ancient authors that are no longer extant.

Eusebius Caesariensis (ca. 263-ca. 339) was an early historian of the Christian Church who lived in Caesarea Maritima, located on the eastern Mediterranean coast in what is now Israel.  He became Bishop of Caesarea around 313 and was a prolific writer on many religious topics.  One of his many works that has survived is his De Evangelica Praeparatione (translated as Preparation for the Gospel) in which he attempts to prove the superiority of Christianity in comparison with all other ancient religions.

This was the first book in which Jenson used the Roman he designed. Jenson's Roman type was ""the first to be designed in accordance with typographical criteria, free of the conventions of written models. Jenson sought to create ideal individual letters, which by means of subtleties of fit and alignment would combine harmoniously on a page. He largely succeeded, and his books live to the claim made from them in an advertisement put out by Jenson's partners in about 1482: that they 'do not hinder one's eyes, but rather help them and do them good' "" (Berry & Poole, Annals of Printing [1966] 21).

The text was also edited here for the first time by Johannes Santritter. The most celebrated new addition to this edition is for the year 1457, recording the invention of printing: ""It cannot be said by any means, how much the scholars owe the Germans.  For it was Johann Gutenberg zum Iungen, nobleman of Mainz on the Rhine, who invented the art of printing around 1440 with cleverness and skill.  Nowadays it has been extended over almost all the parts of the world; by this method the whole antiquity has been brought together with little metal and can be read by our descendants in innumerable volumes.""

Henri Estienne issued to editions of the work in 1512 and 1518.

Second edition of Saint Jerome’s Latin translation of Eusebius’s Chronicon, with the continuations by him, Prosper Aquitanicus and Matthaeus Palmerius of Florence. The superbly printed Ratdolt edition, edited by Johannes Lucilius Santritter, contains an entry for the year 1440 (v3v) crediting Johannes Gutenberg with the invention of “an ingenious way of printing books.” This was one of the first acknowledgements in print of Gutenberg’s invention. The entry for 1457 on v3v contains the third published reference to Johann Gutenberg as the inventor of printing, after those in the 1474 Chronica of Riccobaldus Ferrariensis and the 1483 Supplementum chronicarum of Jacobus Philippus de Bergamo.  According to Paul Needham, this statement “influenced the account in the 1499 Cologne Chronicle, where it is stated that the printing process was ‘developed’ (‘wart undersoicht’) in the year 1440 and after, whereas printing was ‘begun’ (‘do began men tzo drucken’ in the jubilee year 1450 and after. If this statement is correct, it must refer to the period when Gutenberg was living in Strasbourg. . . . (Needham, “Prints in the Early Printing Shops,” in Parshall, ed., The Woodcut in Fifteenth-Century Europe [2009], p. 44).
Eusebius, Roman historian and Bishop of Caesarea in Palestine, composed his Chronicon or universal history around the year 310 CE. Though Eusebius’s original Greek text was lost, the work was preserved by its translation into Latin by Jerome, and by its translation into Armenian. One of Eusebius’s’ innovations in this work was a tabular system to coordinate events drawn from several distinct historiographic traditions. His use of the tabular format was influenced by the column arrangement of Origen’s Hexapla, a massive compilation of parallel texts of the Bible in tabular form, with which he was familiar. Eusebius’s Chronicon became a fundamental text for the development of historical writing in the Middle Ages.
As Anthony Grafton and Megan Williams wrote in Christanity and the Transformation of the Book (2006, p. 136), Eusebius’s Chronicon made it possible to “fix a whole world on paper” by aligning data from various strands of biblical and Near Eastern historiography. Eusebius divided his Chronicon into two parts, the Chronography and the Canons. The Chronography is a tabular list of synchonisms of Greek, Roman, and Jewish history; the Canons is a systematic chronicle of world history, following nineteen ancient states down through time, culminating in one column representing the Roman empire.
Ancient and medieval historians had their own techniques of chronological notation. From the fourth century in Europe, the most powerful and typical of these was the table. Though ancient chronologies were inscribed in many different forms, among scholars the table form had a normative quality much as the timeline does today. In part, the importance of the chronological table after the fourth century can be credited to the Roman Christian scholar Eusebius. Already in the fourth century Eusebius had developed a sophisticated table structure to organize and reconcile chronologies drawn from historical sources from all over the world. To clearly present the relations between Jewish, pagan, and Christian histories, Eusebius laid out their chronologies in parallel columns that began with the patriarch Abraham and the founding of Assyria. The reader who moved through Eusebius’s history, page by page, saw empires and kingdoms rise and fall, until all of them—even the kingdom of the Jews—came under Rome’s universal rule, just in time to make the Savior’s message accessible to all of humanity. By comparing individual histories to one another and the uniform progress of the years, the reader could see the hand of providence at work.
Eusebius created his visually lucid Chronicle just when he and other Christians were first adopting the codex, or bound book, in place of the scroll. Like other Christian innovations in book design, the parallel tables and lucid, year-by-year, decade-by-decade order of the Chronicle reflected the desire of early Christian scholars to make the Bible and the sources vital for understanding it available and readily accessible for quick reference. The Chronicle was widely read, copied, and imitated in the Middle Ages.

It cannot be said by any means, how much the scholars owe the Germans.  For it was Johann Gutenberg zum Iungen, nobleman of Mainz on the Rhine, who invented the art of printing around 1440 with cleverness and skill.  Nowadays it has been extended over almost all the parts of the world; by this method the whole antiquity has been brought together with little metal and can be read by our descendants in innumerable volumes.

Ritman sale 12-5-01: DESCRIPTION 

The second edition of Eusebius's chronicle of world history down to the year 225 consists largely of chronological tables with short historical notices. The original Greek text is lost but St Jerome's translations of the 'Canons'' or tables, survive.

Eusebius's Historia ecclesiastica is at the root of all Christian historiography, and forms the basis of all chronology. It was much read in its Latin version, even although the Greek text was not published until the 1540s in Paris, and had in various forms circulated from an early date throughout the Christian world: part of the text is known in an Armenian version.

Eusebius followed what became orthodox Christian teaching, seeing the New Testament and the figure of Christ attested in the Old Testament. Wisdom -Sophia-Sapientia- in the OT stands for Christ, the logos of St. John's gospel, who existed from all eternity, and who, with the father, formed Adam. The whole of the history of the Jewish people as told in the OT is a preparation for Christ and the Christian Church, something Eusebius wrote of in his Praeparatio evangelica.

The editio princeps, printed by Philippus de Lavagnia in Milan c. 1474 (Goff E116), also contains the continuations of Prosper of Aquitaine and Matthaeus Palmerius of Florence (as far as 1448), while those of Matthias Palmerius of Pisa (as far as 1481) are new to the present edition. They include the famous reference, under the year 1457, to the invention of printing by Johann Gutenberg in 1440 solerti ingenio ('with great skill'), a phrase which is reused by Ratdolt in the colophon to describe himself.

The book was reprinted in Venice and Paris in 1562.  Falloppius was first a pupil and then the successor to Vesalius in the chair of anatomy at Padua.  
First edition of the greatest Italian anatomical book of the sixteenth century. Rather than a complete study of the whole of anatomy, Falloppio, who was a pupil of Vesalius, designed this work as a critical commentary to his teacher's De humani corporis fabrica, correcting some of its errors and adding additional observations and details. For this reason there was no need for illustrations. In fact it was a work of great originality, in which Falloppio reported many new discoveries and observations. It was the only book published during his lifetime and the only one which can be said to be fully authentic.  Bylebyl in his article about Colombo in DSB suggests that Falloppio claimed the work was written in 1555 and was published to establish his priority over Colombo whom he succeeded in the chair at Padua.
Falloppio discovered and first described the chorda tympani, semicircular canals and the aqueduct of Falloppius, correctly described the structure and course of the cerebral vessels, and knew the circular folds of the small intestines. He enumerated all the nerves of the eye, and introduced a number of anatomical names, including cochlea, labyrinth, palate, vagina and placenta, and is best remembered for his account of the tubes named after him. He also gave excellent descriptions of the ovaries, hymen, clitoris, and round ligaments, and proved the existence of the seminal vesicles. He included an important account of the kidneys, which may antedate that of Eustachius. He also discusses primary and secondary dentition.  Vesalius replied positively to Falloppio's book with his Anatomicarum Gabrielis Falloppii observationum examen, 1564, published posthumously by his friends.

Castiglioni describes him as ""without doubt the most illustrious of the Italian anatomists of the 16th century"". A loyal pupil of Vesalius, Falloppio discovered and described the chorda tympani, the semicircular canals, the sphenoid sinus, the ovaries (Fallopian tubes), the round ligaments, the trigeminal, auditory, and glossopharyngeal nerves, and named the vagina and placenta. 

T-S: First edition of Falloppio's detailed critical commentary on Vesalius' Fabrica.
""One of the most important of the many-sided physicians of the sixteenth century"" (Haller), Galileo Falloppio was born  at Modena, in 1523, he died on  9 October, 1562, at Padua. 
Falloppio studied medicine at Ferrara, at that time one of the best medical schools in Europe. After taking his degree he worked at various medical schools and then became professor of anatomy at Ferrara, in 1548. He was called the next year to Pisa, then the most important university in Italy. In 1551 Falloppio was invited by Cosmo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, to occupy the chair of anatomy and surgery at Padua.  Though he died when less than forty, he had made his mark on anatomy for all time. This was the golden age of anatomy and Falloppio's contemporaries included such great anatomists as Vesalius, Eustachius, and Columbus. 
Falloppio's own work dealt mainly with the anatomy of the head. He added much to what was known before about the internal ear and described in detail the tympanum and its relations to the osseous ring in which it is situated. He also described minutely the circular and oval windows (fenestræ) and their communication with the vestibule and cochlea. He was the first to point out the connexion between the mastoid cells and the middle ear. His description of the lachrymal passages in the eye was a marked advance on those of his predecessors and he also gave a detailed account of the ethmoid bone and its cells in the nose. His contributions to the anatomy of the bones and muscles were very valuable. It was in myology particularly that he corrected Vesalius. He studied the organs of generation in both sexes, and his description of the canal or tube which leads from the ovary to the uterus attached his name to the structure. Another structure, the little canal through which the facial nerve passes after leaving the auditory, is also called after him the aquæductus Falloppii. 
Vesalius responded positively to his student's work with his posthumously published Examen on Falloppio, published in 1564.

The work is in the form of an exposition of and commentary on the relevant passages of Hippocrates. It was transcribed from lecture notes and edited by Giovanni Bonacci, who has dedicated it to the great Venetian printer Vincenzo Valgrisi.  Falloppio (1523-62), the foremost Italian anatomist of the sixteenth century and rival to Vesalius, made innumerable contributions to the understanding of human anatomy. His knowledge of detailed anatomical structure of the head assisted him in advancing surgical practice in dealing with head wounds, although he himself was not a skilled surgeon (O'Malley in the DSB remarks dryly that Falloppio began the practice of surgery but displayed so little aptitude for that subject - as demonstrated by the fatal outcome of a number of his cases - that he soon thereafter abandoned it and returned wholly to the study of medicine).  
The work covers cranial anatomy, treatment of cranial fractures, injuries to the brain, convulsions and inflammations, etc. Evidencing considerable knowledge of cerebral anatomy, Falloppio was the first to describe ‘the arterial circle of vessels at the base of the human brain... He described the union of the anterior rami (corresponding to our anterior communicating arteries) to the carotid arteries’ (Garrison’s history of Neurology p 58).Besides elucidating Hippocratic texts on brain anatomy, Fallopppio corrects other writers, such as Aristotle, Vidius, Cornarius, and Colombo.
The work covers cranial anatomy, the structure of the cranium, treatment of cranial fractures, injuries to the brain, convulsions and inflammations, etc.  This is a rare work, and not in the standard medical bibliographies. It was reprinted in the Opuscula tria in 1569.

Fernel advanced the idea of discarding the reliance on Galen.  He stressed the importance of physicians studying the human body themselves, an idea that may have influenced his pupil, Vesalius.  The Physiologiae was first published in 1542 and was incorporated into the present work. which was a standard text throughout Europe.  It contains the first account of appendicitis including the autopsy findings.  Portrait of Fernel on verso of *3.   Dedicated to Henri II. 
The first systematic treatise on pathology, which also introduced the names for the sciences of pathology and physiology. In the second part of the above, entitled ""Pathologia"" (a term Fernel introduced), Fernel provided the first systematic essay on the subject, methodically discussing the diseases of each organ. The result was a succinct summary of the best available knowledge of organic abnormality in disease. Fernel's predecessor Benivieni, whose De abditis (1507) represents the foundation of modern pathology, had presented a collection of case histories without any attempt at a logical or methodical system. Fernel's contributions to the study of aneurysms were particularly noteworthy. He was the first to associate arterial dilatation with aneurysm and he differentiated true from false aneurysms. Fernel also attributed the cause of arterial aneurysms to syphilis, which was pandemic during the Renaissance. Although Fernel's earlier treatise, De naturali parte medicinae (1542; PMM 68), has long been considered the earliest work devoted exclusively to physiology, Fernel actually named that science ""Physiologia"" as the title to the revised edition of it which forms the first part of the Medicina. 

Within six years after his graduation from medical school Fernel became one of the most famous physicians in France. His reputation at the court of the dauphin (later Henri II) became firmly established when he saved the life of Henri's mistress, Diane de Poitiers. Fernel was however less successful with François I, Henri's father, who died of syphilis in 1547.

""With his insistence on personal observation and experiment, Fernel was one of the most influential representatives of a new school of medicine. A very successful physician in Paris, he cured the sterility of Catherine de Medici and the ill-health of Diane de Poitiers, and later became physician to Henry II.""‘On the Natural Part of Medicine’ [i.e., De Naturali Parte Medicinae, 1542] was later revised and published as the first part of his great general book, the Medicina, Paris, 1554. In that edition it was first called ‘Physiologia’, thus giving the subject the name by which it has been known ever since. The orthodox theories of the four humours (blood, phlegm, yellow and black bile), the four qualities (hot, cold, wet, dry), and the four elements (earth, air, fire and water), on whose proper interrelations the functions of a healthy body were believed to depend, still prevailed in Fernel. But he entirely rejected all magic and superstition as irrelevant to the study of bodily functions, and clearly stated that anatomy shows only the location and not the nature of these processes. Fernel included in ‘physiology’ the study of the mind and brain. ""Equally important was the second part of the 1554 Medicina, the Pathologia. The first book on pathology was De Abditis Causis Morborum, Florence, 1507, by the Italian physician Benivieni (c. 1440-1502); it was a pioneer work in which for the first time post-mortem studies were used for finding internal causes of diseases. But Benivieni was a Galenist and did not develop a new system. It was Fernel who first used the term ‘pathology’ and his was the first systematic essay on the morbid phenomena of the human body, examined methodically organ by organ. Hitherto pathological study had been confirmed to collections of case-histories without any attempt at a logical or methodical system. Fernel’s work included a number of notable observations - in the 1567 edition there is a case-history which has been claimed as the first description of appendicitis. Everything that was a cause of an ailment was part of his conception of pathology; later the term was identified more closely with morbid anatomy alone, until at the end of the nineteenth century Cohnheim initiated a return to Fernel’s wider concept.""Both physiology and pathology had, of course, existed in rudimentary form before Fernel; but he was the pioneer who gave these subjects their names and established them as separate systems. His books were very widely studied; the Physiologia went through thirty-four editions in the next hundred years and was translated into French and English."" (Printing and the Mind of Man).

Ferri also deals with wounds from heavy guns and cannons.  He illustrates his instrument, an alphonsinum, for removing bullets.  Unlike Paré, Maggi and Botallo,  Ferri continued to support the idea of Vigo that gunshot wounds were poisonous.  He did recommend the removal of clothing and armor from the wounds.  This work is reprinted in Gesner's Chirurgia along with Maggi's.  Ferri also published a work on the use of guiac wood for syphilis.  

Iowa: The first part of the book deals with the treatment of gunshot wounds and covers such complications as infection, compound fractures, imbedded foreign bodies, and so forth. Directions for compounding a wide variety of medications are given and Ferri's instrument for extracting bullets, the alphonsinum, is described. 

The second monograph on the treatment of gunshot wounds (Paré's being the first), which, with syphilis on which Ferri also wrote a monograph, were the two greatest medical problems of the sixteenth century. Ferri was the first to deal with injuries caused by heavy guns. He invented a surgical instrument called an ""alphonsinum"" for removing bullets, which is illustrated in three woodcuts on page 29. He advised correctly that pieces of clothing and armour left deep in a wound led to suppuration, and should be removed, but he also perpetuated the idea that gunshot wounds were poisonous. The tract on the fleshy growths on the cervix of the bladder is of particular interest to the historian of urology, and is one of the earliest on the subject. The Spaniard Andrès Laguna published a work on the same subject the year before, in 1551, which is cited as the first important work on diseases of the genito-urinary system.

A handsome copy of the second Basel edition of Marsilio Ficino's (1433-99) 'Three Books on Life', dedicated to his patron Cosimo de'Medici. For the famous translator of Plato, and of the hermetic philosophers from ancient Egypt, this was a slight departure from high scholarship into the realm of popular writing that blended folk remedies with the classics, or as the author himself writes, 'Galen, physician of Bodies, and Plato, physician of souls.' The first book 'On Healthy Life' considers black bile, the cause of madness and melancholy, but as Ficino argues, the only bodily substance that engenders profound thought, and thus the origin of genius. In this way Ficino's book is not only a 'Treatise on Healthy Living for the Learned' as he calls it, but the first to defend the temperamental genius because ""it sometimes helps to be a little crazy""(Kaske cit. infr.). After arguing ""Why Melancholics are Intelligent"" Ficino's final chapters of Book 1 provide remedies for rheum, phlegm, stomach aches, and headaches: the side-affects of melancholy. The second book 'On Long Life' continues in this vein with a advice on diet, exercise, and daily habit, (sometimes suspect: 'we should avoid both continual thinking and sexual intercourse') in order to leave a happy and healthy life. The final six chapters are addressed to the elderly, with one chapter dedicated to the uses of rose-honey, probably the earliest known superfood, and another on the significance of art and music to the well-lived life. Book Three radically changes pace from treatments for the body to consultations with the stars, reading something like a New Age Self-Help Book, i.a. ""How We Should Use the Planets in Medicines"", ""Seven Ways in Which We Can Accommodate Ourselves to Celestial Things"", ""Astronomical Precautions to Be Taken in Procreating Children, In Preparing Meals, in Buildings, and in One's Dwelling Place and Clothing"". It is not only the longest of the three books, but the most controversial, as every chapter prescribes occult practices in the name of therapy, for instance instructing readers how to capture the spirits of the stars into silver or gold rings. It was this portion of De vita which put Ficino into direct conflict with the Church for the first time: although he claims he is merely interpreting Plotinus, the more blatant references to magic are not from Plotinus but from the hermetic philosophers Proclus, and especially Al-Kindi's Picatrix. From Ficino's correspondence in 1490, we know Pope Innocent VIII found inklings of heresy in the work, and he successfully petitioned his friends in Rome for help in restoring his name to favour. The book concludes with an Apologia, another preventative measure to contain the dispute with Rome that broke out after the book's publication. In it, Ficino emphasises his vocation as a priest and physician, interested in physical healing for the sake of spiritual healing, and repeats again and again that he does not approve of 'profane magic', but only 'natural magic', that of the Magi who first adored Christ at his birth. Rare in completely original condition, as here.


Three books on life, the first being the earliest treatise on the health of scholars; the second on good health and long life; and the third on astrological medicine. There are chapters on headaches, diseases of the stomach, and dietetics. The sections on melancholy are often cited.
Ficino’s father was an eminent physician in the household of Cosimo de’ Medici where the young Marsilio got his elementary education. He was also interested in natural philosophy and made considerable progress in medicine under his father’s tuition. At the age of eighteen Ficino was chosen by Cosimo for his long cherished project, the foundation of a Platonic academy. Ficino’s Latin translation of Plato into Italian (1484) became the standard text and he was also responsible for the translation of the works associated with Hermes Trismegistus known as the ‘Corpus Hermeticum’. He translated and edited many Neoplatonic writings, a number of which are included in the Aldine edition of Iamblichus of 1497.

Johann Amerbach (b. c. 1440 in Amorbach, Germany; d. 25 December 1513 in Basel, Switzerland) was a celebrated printer in Basel in the 15th century. He was the first printer in Basel to use the Roman type instead of Gothic and Italian; he spared no expense in his art. Amberbach published another edition in 1507, also ff. 100.",Provenance: Prof. Guiseppe Franchini (1879-1938) Ink stamp name on rear endpaper.,"The De vita libri tres or Three Books on Life was written in the years 1480–1489 by Italian Platonist Marsilio Ficino. It was first circulated in manuscript form and then published on December 3, 1489.[1] It was constantly in print through the middle of the seventeenth century.

De vita is a curious amalgam of philosophy, medicine, ""natural magic"" and astrology, and is possibly the first book ever written about the health of the intellectual and its peculiar concerns. Alongside passages explaining the immortality and divine source and nature of the soul, there are astrological charts and remedies, speeches from various Greek gods arguing with one another, philosophical digressions, medieval prescriptions for various ills, attempts at reconciling the Neoplatonism of Plotinus with Christian scripture, and magical remedies and talismans.

Ficino was one of the major philosophical voices of the Italian Renaissance, but he was also a physician, and the son of a physician. De vita is an example of the medical thinking of the early Renaissance, steeped in Galen and Hippocrates and the theory of the four humors and their attendant Aristotelian qualities (e.g., hot, cold, moist,dry), but also beginning to align this viewpoint with the awakening sense of the archetypal significance of the pagan gods, derived from the first exposure in the West for many centuries to the dialogues of Plato and to the Hermetica. (Ficino was the first translator of Plato into Latin.)

The result—particularly in the third book—is a work which takes the pagan Classical god-archetypes quite literally, and personifies them with the planets which are named for them. For Ficino, the planets affect the tenor and vigor of the intellectual's mind and the health of his body. But the main thrust of de Vita is the notion that there are remedies and balances that can be undertaken to mitigate their effect—in fact, to change the temper, even the fate, of a human being. In this regard, Ficino shows his deeply humanist point of view, which sets him apart from earlier writers.

The book's thrust depends on the tension Ficino tries to resolve intellectually—a tension that is typical of the syncretism of much of the early Renaissance—between Classical philosophy and religion and Christian belief. By filtering both through cosmology of Plato, Ficino attempts to reconcile these world-views.

An English translation by Charles Boer of the De vita was published in 1982.

A critical edition and English translation of the Three Books on Life, with the Latin on one page and the English translation on the facing page, with Introduction and Notes, by Carol V. Kaske and John R. Clark, was re-published in 1998 and again in 2002 by The Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, in conjunction with The Renaissance Society of America.`",Ficino Marcilio1497-1.jpg,Ficino Marcilio1497-2.jpg,"3.

He was a chronicler and Biblical scholar. He was born in 1434 at Solto near Bergamo where he died in 1504. His Supplementum chronicarum (1483) was a universal chronicle running to numerous subsequent editions. Amongst other things, it records Giovanni da Carignano's lost work on papal contacts at Avignon in 1306 with Ethiopian visitors. Boninus [Dobric Dobricievic] was a Croat who began priniing in Verona before moving to Brescia and later, Lyons. He was born on the island of Lastovo, 1454-1528. His last years were spent as the dean of the Cathedral church in Treviso. His most famous work was the illustrated Brescia Dante.

First edition of one of the most renowned world chronicles of the late medieval era  and first work with a date printed by the famous Italian typhographer Bernardinus Benalius.  According to bibliographical sources, 650 copies of this edition were printed, but the work was so successful that in the same year it was provided an italian translation and, since 1485 it was reprinted several times and the year after, enriched with some illustrations of biblical scenes and many nice city views . Of particular interest is the citation, in the chapter dedicated to the year 1459, to the beginning of the printing, with the mention of Gutenberg, Fust and Jenson.

A double-rule chronological bar runs along every page, separating two calendars: on either side of the bar is printed, at the head of each annual section, the date since Creation and the Christian year.  

Second edition of the Chronicles of the Augustinian friar from Bergamo, which are among the first productions of modern European historiography. Published for the first time in Venice two years before, the fifteen books of the Supplementum chronicarum constitute a historical-descriptive chronology of the most important facts from the creation of the world to the end of the 1470s. Characteristic feature of this work is the use of sources (altogether over one hundred) both patristic and profane. From its reading we can understand the deep knowledge of Foresti concerning the works of Dante (1265 - 1321), Petrarca (1304 - 1374) and Boccaccio (1313 - 1375), this latter a privileged source as evidenced by the recurring quotes from his Genealogia deorum. Among the other texts utilized for the drafting of the Supplementum we find the Vitae Pontificum by Bartolomeo Platina (1421 - 1481) and the Chronicon by Saint Antonino Pierozzi (1389 - 1459). True editorial success, in addition to a translation in vernacular Italian contemporary to the princeps (reprinted several times), Foresti’s work knew dozens of editions published between the 1480s and 1581. The ultimate edition, including a 16th book on the years 1480-1499 was published in 1503 under the title Novissimae hystoriarum omnium repercussiones […] quae Supplementum Supplementi Cronicarum nuncupantur (Venice, Alberto da Lessona). Foresti’s Chronicles became in turn a source for new works on world history in no time. They were used first by Hartmann Schedel (1440 - 1514) for his Liber chronicarum (or. ed. Nuremberg, Anton Koberger, 1493), then by Marco Antonio Sabellico (c. 1436 - 1506) for his Enneades (printed between 1498 and 1504). Particularly famous and appreciated are the implemented editions of the Supplementum, and among all the Italian one printed in 1554 (Venice, Pietro Boselli and Girolamo Calepino) with complementary texts by Paolo Giovio (1483 - 1552), Pietro Bembo (1473 - 1547), Jean Carion (d. 1537) and Marco Guazzo (1480 - 1556).

Small folio  (311 x 209). (23), 358, (1) ff. (fols. aa1 & b10 blank). 49 lines and headlines. Tables in 2 columns, quire register at end (T8r) in 4 columns, printed marginalia. Capital spaces. Double rules along inner margins of text and between table columns. Lombardic initials supplied in red, capital strokes and paragraph marks. Contemporary alum-tawed blindstamped pigskin over wooden boards, sewn on four double and 2 single cords, bound in the monastic shop of the Würzburg Benedictines (Kyriss 37 / Schwenke-Schunke II, 317 / EBDB w000063), covers paneled with six vertical triple fillets including outer borders and four horizontal triple fillets, decorated with several stamps from that shop (cf. below). Trace of a parchment title label on upper cover, nail holes and discoloration from 10 now-lost metal corner- and centrepieces, pair of chased brass and leather fore-edge clasps. Later shelfmark no. 126 in red ink on plain spine, small 20th c. paper label; 15th c. manuscript waste quire liners. Second edition of a popular world chronicle by an Augustinian cleric, a fine copy in a monastic binding. In his chronicle Foresti proposed to bring together the most important historical facts from each year, starting with Genesis. Although he often placed legend and myth on the same plane as documented history, Foresti's chronicle was the first world history to include short bio-bibliographies of Arab scholars. These were not taken over from any of the principal sources cited by the author (Vincent of Beauvais, Boccaccio, Platina, and St Anthony of Florence), attesting to the breadth of his scholarship (cf. Hasse, Success and Suppression: Arabic Sciences and Philosophy in the Renaissance [2016], p. 32). Six editions of Foresti's chronicle are recorded from 1483 to 1491, the last an Italian translation, all but the present edition printed in Venice. The author continued to revise and expand on the work: for the 1503 edition he would add an extra book bringing the account up to the present. - Bonino de Boninis de Ragusia, a Dalmatian cleric, had worked in Venice in 1479 before setting up a press in Verona (with Venetian types), then moving to Brescia. His productions were ""dominated throughout by Venetian models and methods"" (Scholderer, BMC). Beautifully printed, this edition contains numerous aids to the reader, presumably at least in part as instructed by the author. Two tables in quire aa comprise an alphabetical index of passages mentioning famous women (Foresti essentially plagiarized Boccaccio in his own work on the same subject, published in 1497), and an alphabetical index to cities named in the text. A double-rule chronological bar runs along every page, separating two calendars: on either side of the bar is printed, at the head of each annual section, the date since Creation and the Christian year. Finally, the quire register on the last leaf summarizes the contents of each gathering. - This copy was bound in the shop of the Würzburg Benedictine monks; the tools are: EBDB s004169, two birds on a lily; s004166 = Schwenke Schunke 379a, a banderole with the name of the monastery (san stef. mrt); s004167, a large rosette; s004170, a jumping dog (called a lion by Schunke); plus a diamond-shaped plant tool (38 x 27 mm.), not found in these repertories. - Covers rubbed. Top of first blank leaf clipped, sheet a3.7 (a3 signed ""a2"") on a guard and evidently supplied from another copy, occasional very minor thumb-soiling, foxing to sheet D1.8, minor small marginal dampstains in quire L. Provenance: Würzburg, Benedictines of St. Stephen (contemporary inscription on front pastedown, ""Iste liber pertinet ad S. Stephanum In herbipoli""; a few contemporary marginalia, mainly single words in books 2, 9 and 13). Latterly in the collection of the Aschaffenburg scholar and bookseller Bernd Pattloch (1940-2014) with his bookplate.

","Third edition but first illustrated edition of Jacobus de Bergamo's popular world chronicle. Bernardino Benalio, who printed the first edition of 1483, borrowed most of the illustrations for this edition from Rolewinck's Fasciculus temporum. The smaller town views are for the most part close copies of the blocks used for the first Venetian edition of the Fasciculus (Georg Walch, 1479) and copied by Ratdolt for lattr editions; they include the famous woodcut of Venice, copied in reverse from the Rolewinck blocks. Original to this edition is the larger woodcut of Genoa, on f. 50, used again for Rome on f. 79, and cited by Hind as one of the earliest views of that city. The three large Biblical cuts are derived from the illustrations of Heinrich Quentell's influential Low German Bible (ca. 1478). Hind notes their stylistic resemblance to the work of Hieronymus de Sanctis, described by Essling as ""one of the most gifted artists working in Venice at the end of the fifteenth century"" (Essling 260). Colored copies of any of the early editions of de Bergamo's chronicle are rare.
Giacomo Filippo Foresti da Bergamo (1434-1520) was an Augustinian monk, known as the author of several significant early printed works. He was a chronicler and Biblical scholar. He was born in 1434 at Solto near Bergamo where he died in 1504. His Supplementum chronicarum (1483) was a universal chronicle running to numerous subsequent editions. Amongst other things, it records Giovanni da Carignano's lost work on papal contacts at Avignon in 1306 with Ethiopian visitors. Boninus [Dobric Dobricievic] was a Croat who began printing in Verona before moving to Brescia and later, Lyons. He was born on the island of Lastovo, 1454-1528. His last years were spent as the dean of the Cathedral church in Treviso. His most famous work was the illustrated Brescia Dante. 

The invention of printing appears on f. 282v under the date 1458 and mentions Gutenberg and Fust.  In the earlier and later editions Jenson's name also appears.

 ","Second edition, almost four times the length of the first (1556) edition, with 25 new illustrations including 22 instruments and three full skeletons. “Pierre Franco, creator of suprapubic lithotomy cataract operation and surgical repair of hernia with preservation of the testis, is considered to be one of the greatest surgeons of the Renaissance and a forerunner of urology” (Androutsos, p. 255). “Franco was influential in bringing operative surgery back into the realm of regular surgical practice, recapturing it from the ignorant hands of charlatans and itinerant “cutters.” His major interest was in hernia surgery, to which he introduced several important innovations including an operation preserving the testicle (which was usually removed), a less risky incision at the base of the scrotum and methods for the surgical release of strangulated hernia. Franco was also the first surgeon to address himself seriously to the removal of bladder stones; he gave an account of perineal lithotomy and was the earliest to describe and perform the suprapubic incision” (Norman). 

“A less well known French-born contemporary of Paré, but one who well deserves our recognition as a shining star of Renaissance surgery, was Pierre Franco (?1500-1561). He was born in Provence of humble parents and had little schooling, but was early apprenticed to a barber-surgeon. As a Protestant, he was forced to flee from France and practiced his calling in Lausanne in Switzerland, although he eventually returned to Orange in France and his major work, Treatise on Hernias, was published in Lyon in 1561, just before his death. He deplored the fact that surgeons of his day rejected the use of open operations. This was because of the risks involved in such procedures, which they would often leave in the hands of charlatans. Franco was obviously a bold surgeon who carried out a wide range of the operative procedures known at that time. He describes in great detail his method of radical surgery for strangulated hernia, devising an incision at the base of the scrotum which he claimed was less dangerous than the higher incision. He also carried out cataract surgery and plastic operations on the face and described a new method for operating on cleft lip. In the surgery for bladder stone he was equally inventive … [he was] the first surgeon to remove a bladder stone successfully via an abdominal approach” (Ellis, p. 44).

He describes, in minute detail, the technique of radical operation for inguinal hernia. Like all who preceded him (except for William of Salicet) after the time of Celsus, he removed the testicle as part of his usual procedure. However, for patients who had but one testis he devised an operation in which the organ was spared. Considering the usual incision at the level of the pubis to be unduly dangerous, he “invented” a low incision at the base of the scrotum which, he claims, was used in more than 200 persons by others and himself in the twelve or fifteen years since he first devised it. The clinical picture of strangulated hernia is clearly and vividly described, and methods for the surgical release of strangulation, both with and without opening the sac, are presented. Thus, for the first time, this life-saving procedure became part of the surgical armamentarium. 

“In the surgery for bladder stone he was equally enterprising and inventive. He described and pictured a number of instruments for catheterization and lithotomy, and pioneered in the introduction of several incisions, including the suprapubic approach. 

“Ophthalmic surgery and facial plastic operations also came within his scope, and he developed a new technique for certain forms of harelip. Whatever subject he dealt with was enriched and advanced through his ingenuity. It is with perfect justification that Nicaise said, “Where Franco appeared with all his genius, it was in operative therapeutics; it suffices for us to recall successively his operations to make evident the role that he has played, and to show that no surgeon has attached his name to so many lasting discovered” (Zimmerman & Veith, pp. 194-5). 

“The suprapubic approach to the bladder via a low mid-line abdominal incision, with the bladder distended to push away the peritoneum, is the usual open method employed in the removal of bladder stone today … The first recorded operation of this kind was carried out by Pierre Franco … In the year of his death he gave an account of an operation on a child of about three years of age who had a stone in the bladder the size of a hen’s egg. He was unable to remove the stone via the perineal approach because the enormous stone could not be pushed down into the neck of the bladder. The child’s parents begged him to try to relieve the small patient of his sufferings so he therefore pushed the stone up into the groin with his fingers in the rectum, got his assistant to fix the stone in this situation and then cut down immediately above the pubis into the calculus. The little patient recovered, but Franco advised others not to follow his example! … Indeed, it was not until the 18th century that Johann Bonnet was reported to have carried out the suprapubic operation frequently and with success at the Hôtel Dieu in Paris” (Ellis, p. 189). 

“Although not an academic, Franco decided to write a surgical text based on his many years of experience, which he modestly called a Petit Traité [Petit traité, contenant une des parties principales de chirurgie, laquelle les chirurgiens hernieres exercent, … Lyon, 1556] … His second book, Traité des hernies, was published in 1561 and includes chapters on anatomy, medicine and pharmacology. While in his first book Franco only cites Avicenna, Albucasis and Guy de Chauliac, Traité des hernies contains no less than 356 citations from a wide range of authorities, testifying to the remarkable learning of the supposedly unschooled author. Franco discusses the cleft lip in ample detail, devoting two chapters to the subject. He was the first to state the congenital nature of the malformation clearly, and referred to the unilateral harelip as the “lièvre fendu de nativité” (cleft lip present from birth). He provides a meticulous classification of various types of clefts, calling the bilateral harelip the “dent de lièvre” (hare’s tooth) presumably because this condition was frequently accompanied by a marked protrusion of the premaxilla bone with its teeth. 

“Franco gave a meticulous description of his surgical technique. He used dry sutures, pins and a triangular bandage. He emphasized that an accurate repair produced an unobtrusive scar, an outcome which was “particularly desirable when the patient was a girl”. 

“Surgery on the bilateral harelip was carried out in two stages due to the difficulty of closing an extremely wide cleft, often complicated by a protruding premaxilla. Franco recommended that the cheeks be mobilized in the repair, but did not hesitate to resect the premaxilla. As he wrote: “To extirpate this turpitude, we must first proceed in the manner described above, except when the teeth and maxillary segments are outside and cannot be covered by the mouth. There is no danger in cutting too much of that which serves no purpose, so one uses cutting forceps, or a saw or other instrument suitable for this, leaving the flesh which is over these teeth, if there is any, as it helps when sewing to the other parts on each side. And if there is such a distance between these lips that one cannot bring them together, it will be necessary to use dissection in the mouth similar to those on the preceding case, and proceed with the remainder of the closure as we have described” [Chapter XCVI]. This passage could not be more lucid and illustrates why Franco has been called The Father of Lip Repairs. Like Paré, he passed a pin or fibula across the repair and held this in place with a figure-of-eight thread, a technique invented by Henry de Mondeville (1260-1320) in 1306 for many wounds” (Santoni-Rugiu & Sykes, pp. 222-3).

Fuchs (1501-1556) , a student of Vesalius' classmate Guillaume Rondelet, became a successful physician, a professor of medicine at the University of Tubingen, and a prolific writer in his field; his ""De historia stirpium"" (1542) was a pioneering work of botany. He ""criticized Mondino, promoted dissection, and introduced the use of Vesalius' Fabrica in his teaching, writing a two-volume commentary on it."" (Noga Arikha, Passions and Tempers: A History of the Humors, 2007, p. 147). Fuchs freely acknowledges his debt to Vesalius in the Preface which is here printed for the first time. A second edition appeared at Lyon (1551-1555). ""Although Vesalius did not receive accolades from his mentor [Sylvius] in Paris, applause did come from other quarters. For example, in 1551 Leonhart Fuchs, a professor at Tubingen, published two volumes in which he praised Vesalius before borrowing extensively from his Fabrica. To quote from the preface of his book: 'Although Galen provided no little help to anatomy, yet it is clear that he composed his account from apes and dogs rather than men, as anyone will understand if he uses his eyes as witnesses and is willing to use his hands in dissection. Among those who in our age wrote about the structure of man, Vesalius is the only one to write with exquisite care and to describe in a suitable manner, and had his commentaries not been published we should have been deprived of the true account of many parts of the human body [.] He ought to be praised for his zeal in searching out the truth.'

Fuchs' unillustrated ""Epitome"" was avowedly a student text, based to a great extent on Vesalius who was, in Fuchs' opinion, was divinely inspired to bring to light and make known a part of medicine that was almost extinct or besmirched with error. It is of singular interest in that it draws largely from the first edition of the ""Fabrica."" According to Cushing, ""Vesalius' observations are quoted on almost every page.

The edition is noteworthy for its 10-page preface by Hieronymus Gemusaeus (1505–1544), professor of medicine at Basel and son-in-law of Cratander,, who has the distinction of being “the earliest known reader of Vesalius’ Fabrica,” as described by the British historian of medicine Vivian Nutton, see: “An Early Reader of Vesalius’ Fabrica,” in Vesalius: Official Journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine, Vol. III, No. 2 (December 1997), pp. 73-74.  Gemusaeus’ preface, dated 1 August 1543, contains the earliest acknowledgment of Vesalius’ revolutionary work of modern anatomy, De Humani Corporis Fabrica, which had just recently been published, with a colophon dated June 1543.
            The most relevant portion of Gemusaeus’ preface reads, “Sic enim ANDREAM VESALIVM, Anatomicae disciplinae Antistitem, locos eius [i.e. Galen] permultos a caeteris antea plane ignoratos, partim explicasse, partim etiam restituisse, ex operosissimo illo de Humani corporis fabrica, a se nunc primum edito volumine, nuper cognovimus” (trans.: “We have recently discovered that Andreas Vesalius, the leading figure in the discipline of anatomy, in that work of great endeavour just published, On the fabric of the human body, has dealt with many passages in Galen that were completely unknown to most people.  Some of them he has explained, others he has restored”).
            As Nutton explains, “On August 1, in a preface to a tract on fevers by Antonio Fumanelli, and only two months after Vesalius had approved the colophon to the Fabrica, [Gemusaeus] hailed Vesalius as the leading figure in the discipline of anatomy.  In his newly published book he had dealt with many passages in Galen that were previously unknown, some he had explained, others he had restored, and, Gemusaeus went on to imply, the author must be given the greatest of respect for his important discoveries…
            “Gemusaeus’ reaction, although serving as advertising for his friend Oporinus, is interesting for several reasons.  He acknowledges immediately that the Fabrica marks a break with the past, although he interprets it, in line with Vesalius’ own rhetoric, as a correction, interpretation, and proper restoration of Galen’s anatomical enterprise.  Gemusaeus was a committed Galenist…His comment occurs in a preface to a work almost entirely dependent on Galen’s ideas and even wording. Nonetheless, he welcomes the Fabrica warmly as developing Galen’s anatomical ideas as well as bringing to light Galenic passages that had been previously unknown.”
            This book is of considerable rarity; it is interesting to note that C.D. O’Malley, in his magisterial biography of Vesalius, did not know of this book.  WorldCat locates only two copies in the U.S. (NLM and CPP).

DNB: Gale was apprenticed with John Field, also a well-known surgeon, to Richard Ferris, one of the chief barber-surgeons of the time. After practising for some time in London, he served in the army of Henry VIII at Muttrell in France in 1544 (Treatise of Gunshot, p. 74 b), and there had the good sense to refuse to imperil the lives of eleven soldiers by removing bullets the lodgments of which were uncertain. In 1557 he served under Philip II of Spain at the siege of St. Quentin, and two years later was established in practice in London (Institution, p. 8 b). He was master of the Barber-Surgeons' Company in 1561, and published a volume on surgery in 1563, dedicated to Lord Robert Dudley. It contains four separate treatises. ‘The Institution of Chirurgerie,’ the first, is a sort of catechism of surgery, in which Gale and his friend Field answer the questions of a surgical student named John Yates. The second is ‘The Enchiridion of Surgery,’ a compilation on general surgery, which contains the prescription for Gale's styptic powder often mentioned in contemporary works. Its chief ingredients were alum, turpentine, arsenic, and quicklime. The third is a treatise on gunshot wounds, in which he shows that gunpowder is not a poison, and the fourth is an antidotary or collection of prescriptions. A second volume appeared in 1566 containing some translations from Latin versions of Galen, ‘A brief Declaration of the Worthy Art of Medicine,’ and ‘The Office of a Chirurgeon.’ Gale knew but little Latin, and the translations are the work of his friend Dr. Cuningham. The writings of Gale are mainly compilations, and contain few cases from his own practice. They show him to have had less mother wit than his contemporary William Clowes the elder [q.v.], and less reading than John Banister (1540-1610) [q.v.]. He died in 1587, and left a son, Thomas, also a surgeon, admitted to the guild 18 Jan. 1597","Maunsell II: p. 10 (1586); Fr.

First edition of Linacre translation and the first separate edition of Galen's chief work on therapeutics. The work is edited by Gulielmus Bodaeus. The British Libary has the presentation copy to Henry VIII on vellum.  Prior to the appearance of this edition, the work had been known only through corrupt translations from Arabic.  Thomas Linacre (1460-1524) was the founder of the College of Physicians in 1518 and its president until his death.  

The last page AA6v has printed on it: EME FRVERE ET/VALEBIS PAN/CRATI/CE 'Profit from me and you will be as healthy as an athlete'.  Giles Barber in Thomas Linacre: A bibliographical Survey of his Works (Maddison et al. pp. 290-353) suggests that this is the printer's joke and that the type was supposed to be blank, uninked type to support the page.  Dedication copies to Henry VIII and Wolsey are in the BL.

Thomas Linacre (1460?-1524) was a physician and Greek scholar who was at the forefront of the reform of English medicine. He studied medicine in Padua, where he received his M.D. in 1496, and helped edit the Aldine editio princeps of Aristotle (1495-8). Upon his return to England, he received a M.D. at Oxford, and taught Greek privately, one of his students being Sir Thomas More. Later he was appointed physician to Henry VIII. He was instrumental in the foundation in 1518 of the College of Physicians of London (later known as the Royal College of Physicians), and was its director until his death. 
'Linacre was a medical humanist as well as one of the finest Greek scholars of his day; his major effort, therefore, was directed toward bringing to English physicians a series of classical medical texts that he considered essential and that were, in fact, superior to other medical writings published in England at that time... His very considerable Continental reputation, especially in Greek medical scholarship, was clearly recognized by Erasmus: '... owing to the studies of Thomas Linacre, Galen has begun to be so eloquent and informative that even in his own tongue he may seem to be less so'"" (DSB).

These six Galenic texts in Niccolò Leoniceno’s Latin translations and two original works by him are among the essential first steps toward modern medical practice. Here they are printed together for the first time. Having supplied Kallierges the texts for the first genuine Galenic works to be published in Greek (1500), Leoniceno undertook a series of translations of Galen and Hippocrates based on Humanist principles, personal experience and clinical observation. This effort resulted in his two essays, some 32 leaves reflecting on the practice of medicine free from slavish adherence to classical sources. Two printers collaborated over six months to produce this edition: the first ninety-two leaves came from the press of Bernardinus Vercellensis (completed 16 July 1524) and the final one hundred eighty leaves from Vitali’s (18 January 1524 [n.s. 1525]).

Greek text, and a Latin translation, probably of the fourteenth century. De anatomicis administrationibus libri novem was edited
 by Vesalius in Gunther's 1536 edition.. In De theriaca, ad Pisonem Galen introduced the pharmacological notion that complex remedies, made up of as many as sixty components, depended for their action on the association of two opposite properties. As well, he advanced the theory that Cleopatra broke the skin of her own arm in her suicide. He described the development a panacea by Mithridates VI in the first century BC, and the idea persisted well into modern times. The de pulsus preserves the work of his Galen's predecessor, Herophilus, who amongst other discoveries identified the heart, not the arteries as previously thought, as the source of the puse.

One of the seven volumes comprising the collected works of the Greek physician Galen, published under the general title Opera omnia nunc primum in unum corpus redacta in the years 1541-1542. ""There is no name more illustrious in the whole history of medicine than that of Galen… Written in Greek, this Galenic treasure reached the Latin Western World only through Arabic translations"" (Hagelin). The present volume mainly deals with the anatomy of the human body: the nerves, the muscles, the veins etc. All the volumes were edited by the physician Agostino Gadaldini (1515-1575) from Modena. When the present edition appeared, it was presented as the ""new translation"", based mostly on earlier humanist translations of Greek manuscripts, but also with many new translations and commentaries by well-known physicians of that day. ""It is interesting to note one of Gadaldini's collaborators was Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564). He revised the translations of Galen's anatomical works, in particular the version of Anatomical procedures"" (Fortuna), which can be found in the present volume. The present copy is frequently annotated in the margins in an early hand.

‘Although the Giunta press had published Latin editions of Galen’s works in 1522 and 1528, it was the third edition of 1541, newly translated and re-edited from the extant Greek codices, that the Giunti named their “first” edition. This, the most important of all the Giunta publications, went through eight more editions after the “first,” the last appearing in 1625. Among the many scholars who worked on this enormous project was Andreas Vesalius, who revised the selections on the dissection of nerves, the dissection of veins and arteries, and the long fragment entitled “De anatomicis administrationibus”’ (Norman Catalogue, p. 307, on the edition of 1551).
  ‘The celebrated Joannes Baptista Montanus of Verona was engaged as the editor-in-chief and to him the proper arrangement of the books was entrusted. No expense was spared to seek out and identify the oldest Greek manuscripts and to have them translated by carefully selected scholars who gladly gave their aid without compensation’ (Harvey Cushing, A Bio- Bibliography of Andreas Vesalius pp. 63).
It was the learned Agostino Gadaldino ‘who identified Vesalius and brought him to the Guinta family’s attention. Despite his youth – Vesalius was only twenty-five – he had become the most “celebrate and distinguished contemporary professor of dissection” and was an obvious candidate to contribute to the newly proposed edition ... Vesalius’s formal goal – the objective presented by his publisher – was to present a Latin translation that was void of error and reflective of the most recent translations of Galenic texts. This process entailed clarifying the meaning and style of Galen’s work and amending previous editions of the Latin translation by removing non-Galenic material, correcting corrupt interpretations, and incorporating newly translated material. Despite his having publicly identified errors in some of Galen’s work, most notably in Guinter’s Institutiones, Vesalius remained a student of Galenic anatomy. Through this intense period of textual analysis, in combination with his own research in dissection, Vesalius repeatedly found himself confronted with contradictions between what he believed to be true and what he saw before him ... The controversy over whether or not Vesalius altered the integrity of the original Galen texts remains in the realm of speculation, but it is likely that he incorporated small corrections into De nervorum and De venarum arteriarumque as these were his particular areas of specialty. It does appear that, while working on the third section (De anatomicis adiministrationibus) however, Vesalius’s primary focus was not to alter, but to clarify, the meaning and style of Galen’s text, and, using the available Greek sources, amend the Latin text, delete non-Galenic material, revise corrupt phrases, and add material that he judged authentic’ (Stephen N. Joffe, Andreas Vesalius: The Making, The Madman, the Myth p. 97).
  Whilst the opening volume, containing the Montanus preface, an explanatory note by Gadaldino to medical students concerning the contributors to the project (including his note on Vesalius, which was not reprinted in later editions) as well as some minor works, is absent here, it appears to have been so from at least since the time of rebinding in the 17th- century, as the labels (although damaged with some loss) to the spines of the bindings indicate no gap. Classes 1 through to 7, which include all of the major works and, amongst them, Vesalius’ three contributions to the undertaking, most notably the De anatomicis administrationibus of over 90 pages, are complete, as is the Index volume.
 ‘The financial success of the [Giunta] venture may be estimated from the Basel reprint of Froben in 1542, possibly undertaken to ease the problem of distribution of the heavy folio volumes, and from the numerous later Venetian editions’ (Charles Donald O’Malley, Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, 1514-1564, p. 104).

Very complete listing for Vesalius.

The first part (pp. 1-302) is an annotated list of over 1200  writers.  Part 2 (pp. 304-457) lists French, German and Italian authors and commentators.

Iowa: Le Coq, often referred to by his Latin cognomen of Paschalis Gallus, was a native of Poitiers where he received his medical degree in 1597. He had considerable knowledge of medicine and its literature as a student since the present work was published seven years before he completed his medical training. This work was the first attempt at bibliography to follow that of Gesner (see No. 307 ff.). The main portion of the book is an alphabetical author list of medical books which were written in Latin. Le Coq borrowed freely from Gesner and each of his entries has a brief annotation taken from Bibliotheca universalis. Following this section of over 1200 authors, Le Coq classifies his bibliography and lists medical writers who wrote works in French, Italian, German, as well as those who wrote commentaries on Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and Dioscorides. He concludes the book with lists of medical authors who wrote about such subjects as surgery, anatomy, botany, therapeutics, plague, and syphilis. His work was an important contribution to the development of medical bibliography because it was the first general bibliography of medicine to provide useful information with each entry. Le Coq's work is here bound together with Spach's Nomenclator scriptorum medicorum (see No. 390). The individual responsible for having them bound together must have appreciated the complementary nature of Le Coq's author approach and Spach's subject arrangement.",de Croÿ p. 36; Riolan p. 88; Fuiren p. 103; Trichet du Fresne n1v; Scavenius p. 366; van der Linden 33: 110; Gras p. 54; Scott 1674: p. 149; de Thou II: 413; Le Tellier p. 353; Fr.

","The principal work of Gazius (1449-1528), an Italian physician who acquired considerable fame and fortune in his profession. A guide to healthy living, dealing with such topics as sleep, exercise, sex, hygiene and drugs. Essentially, however, it is a treatise on diet with an emphasis on the qualities and properties of a great number of foods (including their cooking and preparation.) There is a great deal about drinking, drinks and especially wines. Although this was a popular rather than scholarly work, it does synthesize little known Jewish and Arabic teachings about food with more common western texts. (Simon, Bibl. Bacchica 283)

(Reliure de l'époque.). ____ Première édition. ""Important traité de diététique et d'hygiène d'un célèbre médecin de Padoue qui connaissant et aimait le vin.

The principal work of Gazius (1449-1528), an Italian physician of Padua. A guide to healthy living, dealing with such topics as sleep, exercise, sex, hygiene and drugs. Essentially, however, it is a treatise on diet with an emphasis on the qualities and properties of a great number of foods (including their cooking and preparation.) There is a great deal about drinking, drinks and especially wines. Although this was a popular rather than scholarly work, it does synthesize little known Jewish and Arabic teachings about food with more common western texts. ""Antonius Gazius is especially known for his Florida corona medicinae in three hundred chapters. He composed it in 1490 ; it was first printed in 1491, and was reprinted in 1500, 1534, and 1541. He traveled widely in Europe and became physician to Sigismund I of Poland. The Florida corona consists chiefly of rules for the preservation of health and contains little or no astrological medicine. (...) It includes instructions for religious celibates whom it advises not even to read its preceding chapters on sexual intercourse - a caution that might have been better given before these chapters."" (Thorndike, History of Magic and Experimental Medicine V, 170.) Folio A1 (text) is richly illuminated. Contains : title, table, list of authors quoted, dedication, text, one blank, list of errata. At the beginning and end of the errata Gazius airs his grievances against his printers for printing one letter for an other, adding and omitting letters, and wrongly expanding contractions. 'The existence of a blank leaf after the errata is hypothetical.' (BMC). ISTC ig00111000. Goff G111. BMC V 341. GW 10563. Medical Incunabula Part III, MI 50. Item #15907

Only Roesslin's The Byrth of Mankynde (1540) has earlier use of copper plates in an English book (Inglis 315). Canano's work on muscles (1541) contains the first copper engravings used in medical illustration.  First appearance of Vesalius in England and the second, after the e.p. of 1543, of the illustrations. One of the earliest illustrated books to have been issued for the benefit of surgeons through the influence of Henry VIII.  Binding by Bernard Middleton.
The introduction of Vesalius to England may have been through John Caius who returned to London in 1544.  Since he lectured on anatomy to the barber-surgeons, he may have based this on the Fabrica and Epitome since he knew Vesalius in Padua.  Geminus' work utilizes the text of the Epitome and illustrations from both works.  Later editions appeared in 1552 and in English by Nicholas Udall in 1553 and dedicated to Edward VI.  The English edition again appeared in 1559 with a new title page incorporating a portrait of Elizabeth I, the earliest known portrait of her.  This copy has the plates in the earlier state without the extra text on the arterial & venous plates.  See Donaldson, IML. The Library. 11: 89-104.2010. (Also Mortimer Italian).

RCPE: The imprint is taken from the colophon Desc: With an engraved title page Prov: Franciscus Rassius Noeus chirurgus paris. 1546; F. Desneux. Chirurg.; Inigo Jones Note: The first illustrated textbook of anatomy published in England. An abridged version of Vesalius's Epitome, with illustrations copied from both the Epitome and the Fabrica. Geminus, a native of Belgium, arrived in England around 1540, and introduced to the country the art of copper-plate engravings. He practiced for a while as a surgeon and was physician to Henry VIII, but was more active as an engraver. The above work was only the second English book illustrated with copper-plate engravings. (The first, also engraved by Geminus, were used in Raynalde, The byrth of mankynde.) It was also the first to contain an engraved title-page.",Oiselius Medici F66; Fr.

Perhaps Franz von Dietrichstein (1570-1636).,"‘Although by tradition and Vesalius’s own comments this work has been considered the first of the many plagiarisms of Vesalius’s Fabrica and Epitome, Geminus gave full credit to Vesalius in a bold headline on the first leaf of text. He did, however, redraw Vesalius’s woodcuts without permission. This is the second work [and the first of any consequence] printed in England with engraved plates. The new medium of copperplate engraving used by Geminus allowed a sharpness of line impossible for the wood engravers employed by Vesalius. This is in fact the first medical book illustrated with a suite of full-page engraved plates. The title page was called by Hind ‘the first engraving of any artistic importance produced in England’. The book provided a summary of Vesalius’s discoveries more complete than the Epitome but without the size and expense of the Fabrica’ (Garrison and Morton 376.1).
‘Five years before the Compendiosa was first printed, anatomy had become an important subject in plans supported by the Crown to further good surgical practice. Henry VIII had, in 1540, given assent to an Act uniting Barbers and Surgeons into one Company, and in this same year another Act authorised the supply of four corpses of executed felons to be available to them for dissection. The Compendiosa was a text for such studies. It was dedicated to the king, who was said to have suggested that the Vesalian plates should be made available to English surgeons’ (Roberts and Tomlinson, The fabric of the body).
Thomas Geminus (c. 1510–1562) was a Flemish engraver who emigrated to England about 1540. He was also a publisher and scientific instrument-maker, and a surgeon until 1555 when he was examined and penalised by the College of Physicians for practising without a licence. He introduced copperplate engraving into England, and this book is the earliest large-scale production in the new medium. ‘Engraved title-pages only become common from the middle of the century: the earliest English example, early even in a continental context, is that to Thomas Geminus’ book Compendiosa totius anatomie delineatio of 1545... It shows a tableau in glorification of Henry VIII. Geminus was a Fleming and his pegma is a characteristic example of Flemish Mannerism’ (Corbett and Lightbown, The comely frontispiece, pp. 7 et seq. with a detailed analysis of Geminus’ composition).
This is the first and greatest of the Vesalian sequelae. A second edition, with English translation, appeared in 1553 and a third edition in 1559. The plates were then taken to Paris where they were used for André Wechel’s 1564 edition, and for Grevin’s edition of 1569. The Geminus engravings were much more influential than the woodcut originals in spreading knowledge of anatomy in England and on the Continent.
The plates comprise the title, the folding plate of Adam and Eve, 3 skeletal figures, 16 muscle figures, 5 arterial and venal figures, 4 neural figures, 6 figures of organs, 4 of the cerebrum, and one of ocular parts and surgical instruments. For the Adam and Eve figure, ‘Geminus has taken liberties... with the celebrated nude figures from the Epitome, for the male figure in his cleverly copied plate now holds an apple instead of a skull. An enlarged skull is now on the ground with a serpent intertwined, thus emphasizing the Adam and Eve traditon’ (Cushing). Cushing also notes that the nine figures of the female organs on plate 34 are the same as appeared in Raynolds’ 1545 Byrth of mankynde, considered the first English book illustrated with engravings. Plate [25] is in first state, with the unnumbered ninth figure. Several of the plates are in fact composed of smaller plates printed on a single sheet, as detailed by Cushing. This copy has plates printed on all three watermarks recorded by Cushing, the jug, the gauntlet with star, and the letter ‘P’.
This book is normally encountered washed, pressed, or otherwise repaired and restored. The engravings in particular can appear grey and pale in washed copies. In the present copy the lines are black and crisp on the whole, particularly the full figure plates, and the impressions sharp and fresh.




DNB: The first edition was published in 1545, with a dedication to Henry VIII, which is signed ‘tuæ Majestati semper mancipatissimus Thomas Geminus Lysiensis, Londini Quarto Calendas Octobres Anno 1545.’ It has not yet been discovered whence Geminus came, the word ‘Lysiensis’ having hitherto baffled the most learned investigations. This first edition (published by John Herford) contains a very elaborate frontispiece, lightly but firmly engraved, with allegorical figures surrounding the royal arms in the centre. The engravings are among the earliest copper-plate engravings known in England, having apparently been preceded only by the plates to Raynald's ‘Byrthe of Mankynde’ in 1540, which have been sometimes also attributed to Gemini. In 1553 Gemini published a translation of his compendium, made by Nicholas Udall and others, with a dedication to Edward VI, in which he speaks of himself as ‘not so perfeict and experte in the English tonge that I dare waraunt or trust myne owne dooynges,’ and also as by the king's ‘most gracious bountie’ having his ‘livyng and beyng here.’ The same plates and title-page accompany this edition, which was printed by Nycholas Hyll. In 1559 Gemini published a third edition, this time dedicated to Elizabeth, who had just ascended the throne; it was revised by Richard Eden. The same plates are here used again, with the addition of a large folding woodcut by another artist, which is sometimes met with separately, and was incorporated by Gemini into his own work. The same title-page also occurs, only the royal arms have been removed from the centre, and a portrait of Elizabeth (the earliest after her succession) inserted. This edition Gemini printed himself, having set up a press in Blackfriars. Gemini's anatomical plates passed into the possession of André Wechel, a publisher at Paris, who used them for a similar work published there in 1569.","Geminus, Thomas [Thomas Lambrit/Lambert]1545-1.jpg","Geminus, Thomas [Thomas Lambrit/Lambert]1545-2.jpg",,"Geminus, Thomas [Thomas Lambrit/Lambert]1545-3.jpg","Geminus, Thomas [Thomas Lambrit/Lambert]1545-4.jpg",Window,100000,23000,£12000+2400,,2111300,1649244

This translation by Nicholas Udall and Richard Eden was first produced in 1553, the original Latin edition having been published in 1545. Udall (1504-1556) was the author of the first English comedy, Ralph Roister Doister (published posthumously in 1566, and surviving in an unique copy in Eton College Library), and Head Master both of Eton and of Westminster. The text, taken from the work of Henri de Mondeville on surgery &  from Vicary rather that the Epitome of Vesalius.

When John Caius, who lectured on anatomy and surgery at the Barber Surgeons’ Hall, persuaded Thomas Geminus to publish an English version of Vesalius’ Epitome (1553), the text chosen was not a translation from Vesalius but this text compiled by Vicary, lifted from the now lost edition of 1548 (Cushing, Vesalius, pp. 124–125). O'Malley in his introduction to the facsimile of the 1553 edition notes that Caius was not in England between 1539 and 1544/45 and may not been involved in the production of this work. Franciscus Vesalius alludes to him in his introductory letter in The China Root Epistle (1546) and accuses him as a plagiarist.

The woodcuts have been attributed to Hans Wechtlin (ca. 1480/1485–after 1526) based on the legend on visceral fugitive leaf. The scale of some of the illustrations give a sense of detail and emphasis.  These same woodcuts often create the image of Lilliputians operating on Gulliver.  Many of the faces are portraits of individuals and not the usual stylized representations found in works of this period.  The first printed illustrations of the brain appear as a series of small woodcuts around the border of the anatomical fugitive leaf of a cadaver.  This same leaf appeared the following year in the work of Lorenz Fries: Spiegel der Artzney.  The dissection was performed by Wendelin Hock von Brackenauat Strasbourg on a hanged criminal (Ch. 12 fol. 13v).  Carlino comments that this is the only fugitive sheet in which the subject is depicted as a cadaver, and certainly the only one with such specific details about the dissector.

","First published by Johann Schott in Strassburg in 1517, Gersdorff’s Feldtbuch der Wundartzney is the second earliest illustrated book on surgery, preceded only by Hieronymus Brunschwig’s Buch der Cirurgia (1497). Gersdorff’s book was re-issued several times by Schott and went through at least twelve editions. It was also translated into Latin and Dutch. The Augsburg edition has the same woodcuts as in the previous Strassburg editions attributed to Hans Wechtlin, the celebrated Strassburg artist famous for his numerous chiaroscuro woodcuts. Some of his woodcuts for Gersdorff were also used to illustrate other medical books of the period.

Hans von Gersdorff, surnamed ’Schylhans’ or ’Squinting Hans’, from Strassburg. was an army surgeon who took part in numerous campaigns, including the Burgundian War (1476) and the battle of Nancy, where Charles the Bold was slain. His widely circulated handbook of wound surgery was based on forty years of experience, chiefly in various military campaigns. Firearms were used in European warfare already in the fourteenth century but handguns and arquebus were novelties during Gersdorff’s time and he became an expert in this new branch of surgery.

The book is divided into four parts. The first is a summary of anatomy based on old Arabic authors and the works of Guy de Chauliac (c. 1300-68). The second part is on surgery, gunshot wounds and amputation. The third part is on leprosy, and the concluding part is a glossary of some 800 simples of plant, animal and mineral origin, and of diseases and anatomical terms.

The full-page woodcuts are the best surgical illustrations of the period. The scenes of surgical operations are extremely vivid, and their naturalism, their quality of reportage, represent an impressive step forward in the history of medical illustration.

There appear to be two variants of this first edition: one with the bifolium numbered LXX/LXXI (signatures m3.4) present (e.g. at Universität Heidelberg), and another, without this but with an unnumbered bifolium (same signatures m3.4) with two full-page woodcuts including the first illustration of an amputation (e.g. at Augsburg Staats- u. Stadtbibliothek). This  copy contains the unnumbered leaves with the illustrations.

Iowa: Gersdorff was a military surgeon who had gained wide experience during the course of some forty years of campaigning and was an expert in the care and treatment of battlefield injuries. His work is divided into four books which treat of anatomy, surgery, leprosy, and glossaries of anatomical terms, diseases, and medications. Gersdorff emphasized a well-founded knowledge of anatomy because the surgeon was frequently called upon to deal with extensive bodily trauma. He derived his anatomy primarily from the Arabic authors and works of Guy de Chauliac (see No. 107 ff.). The surgical portion of the work was devoted to wound surgery and covers in some detail the methods he employed for extracting foreign objects and amputating limbs. He used a tourniquet to control bleeding when amputating and covered the stump with the bladder of a bovine or swine to help control postoperative hemorrhaging. He also included information on various remedies and medications that might be employed by the surgeon. Of special interest are the sedatives and analgesics, although he appears not to have employed them in his practice. The section on leprosy is given over largely to remedies for a disease he did not believe could be cured. The final part of the book consists of a series of Latin-German glossaries containing anatomical terms, diseases, and some 800 simples of animal, mineral, and plant origin. The book contains many woodcuts, attributed to Hans Wechtlin (b. ca. 1480), which depict anatomy, surgical operations, and surgical instruments and devices. Herrlinger comments that ""The illustrations . . . belong to the early phase of 16th-century medical illustration and represent one of its high points"" (History of medical illustration. London, 1970. p. 142). The practical nature of Gersdorff's book and its fine illustrations caused it to become very popular and it was frequently referred to, widely quoted, and freely plagiarized. The work went through at least twelve editions between the time of its first publication in 1517 and the early seventeenth century. The book also appeared in several Latin and Dutch editions.",Martius D1v; Platner II: 9204; Heister 3683 (1528); Thott III Q6759 (1535); VII Q1529 (1528); Kloss 4095; Libri 1861: 3352 (1530); Wittwer Q916.2 (1530);,,,"Gersdorff, Hans von1526-1.jpg","Gersdorff, Hans von1526-2.jpg",,"Gersdorff, Hans von1526-3.jpg","Gersdorff, Hans von1526-4.jpg",B5,50000,22000,,,2411300,1766244

Robert Constantinus published an index to the Bibliotheca in Paris in 1555; An enlarged edition, also edited by Simler, appeared in 1574 and contains approximately 35,000 titles.  Finally Froschauer published yet another enlarged edition of Simler's work in 1583, edited by Johann Jakob Fries.  The book is dedicated to Leonardus Beckh whose coat of arms appears on *7r.  Among the medical writers cited are Vesalius (l. 42), Berengario (l. 352), Geminus, Gersdorff, Tagault, Vidius, Estienne, Brunschwig and Paracelsus (l. 614v).  This contains the earliest bibliographic listing of the works of Vesalius.  Included are the 1537 and 1539 editions of Rhazes by Winter, the 1539 Epistola Docens and the Fabrica.  The contents are summarized and the physical description of the number of gatherings in quarto or folio is given.  Gesner concludes the section on Vesalius by commenting that he was 28 years old when he wrote the Fabrica.

Le Cene (1647?-1703) dated 1675 and the bookplate of Myron Prinzmetal who purchased it from Harry Levinson in 1969.  ,"Le Cène, Charles 1647?-1703, Huguenot refugee, born ‘about’ 1647 at Caen, Normandy, of well-to-do parents, studied theology at Sedan from 1667 to 1669, and afterwards resided at the universities of Geneva (August 1669 to November 1670) and Saumur (1670 to March 1672). In 1672 he received ordination as a protestant minister at Caen, and ‘shortly’ after received a call to the church of Honfleur. While there he married a lady of some fortune, formed a considerable library, and began a new French translation of the Bible, at which he worked throughout his life. His ministry at Honfleur ceased by his own request on 2 Sept. 1682, and in the following year he officiated temporarily at Charenton. His settlement at Charenton was opposed on account of his Socinian tenets; but at the end of a year of temporary ministry he seems to have been granted a certificate attesting his orthodoxy. His son Michel (followed by Haag) states that he attempted to press his claim to remain permanently at Charenton, and carried the case from the consistory of Paris to the synod, before which the quarrel remained undecided at the date of the revocation of the edict of Nantes. Gousset (Considerations) is probably more accurate in asserting that Le Cène, after preaching at Charenton, failed to receive a call to Orleans, owing to the unsatisfactory testimony given him by the consistory. He certainly had adopted heterodox opinions concerning predestination (London Hug. Soc., iii. 33). At the date of the revocation of the edict of Nantes, like many other Huguenot ministers, he appears to have hastily journeyed to the Hague (22 Dec. 1685), and passed on to England. According to his son, he brought over his library and sufficient means to enable him to live comfortably and to assist his brethren.","Gesner, Conrad1545-1.jpg","Gesner, Conrad1545-2.jpg","

Bound in blindstamped pigskin over wooden boards, with the crucifixion and coming of Holy Ghost in the shape of a dove on upper cover, Christ arisen on the back cover, slightly discoloured, corners bumped, lacking clasps, but overall a good copy. The first subject bibliography. Conrad Gesner (1516-65), a Swiss natural historian, was crowned by Dibdin as the “father of bibliography”. After touring libraries in Germany and Italy, he, at the age of 25, decided to produce a bibliography of all the printed books ever published in Greek, Latin and Hebrew.  In 1545 his Bibliotheca Universalis was published which included more than 12,000 items with his commentary. This work, the Pandectarum, followed in 1548 classifying these books according to subject matter into categories.  Only Books I-XIX were published.  Book XX on medicine never appeared.  Book XXI on theology was published separately in 1549.  Each book is dedicated to a famous printer and lists many of the books published by him.  Froschauer, Oporinus (III) listing medical works including Vesalius' Fabrica and the Latin and German Epitomes, Robert Estienne (V), Aldus Manutius (XI), Sebastian Gryphus (XII), Tomaso Giunta (XIX), Froben (XXI).

Gesner completed this vast work in just seven years, referring to all literature available to him and corresponding with more than 50 scholars all over Europe to gather the latest insights and discoveries. He conscientiously lists all his sources in true bibliographic fashion in the various introductions. This volume treats the mammals only. Of the representation of an Indian rhinoceros, Gesner reports that it was copied by his draftsman from Dürer's woodcut on a broadside which described the first such animal shown in Europe. Dürer's rendition of the strange animal is rather stylized and reminiscent of a suit of armour. Gesner collected the pictorial material himself and contributed a number of drawings of his own. The cuts were probably executed at Froschauer's workshop. The repeatedly occurring monogram ""FO"" is thought by Leemann-van Elck to stand for Franz Oberreiter from Strasbourg.  The woodcuts are thought to be cut after paintings by Lukas Schan, some of which are in the Felix Platter collection in the library of the University of Basel.  The illustrations tend to be scientific and naturalistic, and Leemann-van Elck considers it a very important monumental work from a xylographic, typographic, and scientific point of view.  The indices at the front give the names of the animals in Latin, Greek, German French, Spanish, Italian and English.  There are many neat annotations in several hands on the fly leaves as well as in the margins.  Signatures b4v- g1r contain a Catalogi Authorum, an early bibliography of natural history.  

RCPE: Konrad Gesner, one of the great polymaths of the 16th century, studied at Basle, Paris, and Montpellier, became professor of Greek at Lausanne, and finally professor of medicine and town physician at Zurich. His numerous writings covered a vast range of topics, and those on botany, zoology, medicine, and pharmacology, became standard reference works throughout Europe for over 200 years. He also made important contributions to classical philology, theology, and the study of linguistics. The above work has been called ""the foremost zoological work of the Renaissance period and the starting point of modern zoology"" (Lilly).

First editions of Gesner's history of birds and of oviparous quadrupeds, part of his great encyclopaedia of the animal kingdom,  the first systematic treatise on zoology of the Renaissance, accompanied by the first edition of his Icones avium, a condensation of the De avium using the same woodcuts asthat work.  The woodcuts of the De avium are the second important suite of ornithological iconography, being roughly contemporary with those of Belon published the same year. They are the precursors of many of Aldrovandi's illustrations, many of which were copied from Gessner. They were drawn by Lukas Schan, and cut by ŒF.O.¹, possibly Franz Oberreiter.  Thirty of the original paintings survive in the Felix Platter collection in Basel.  The oviparous quadrupeds volume, the second volume of the Historia animalium to appear, also contains a supplement to the viviparous quadrupeds.
The binding, featuring a roll-tool of vases, roses and a female bust, is by the Hieronymous Wolf-master=binder who bound for Wolf and Fugger; a similar binding in Ilse Schunke, Die Einbände der Palatina in der Vatikanischen Bibliothek, vol I, p 201 and plate CXlV; on the Wolf-master see M. Bachmann, Die Entwicklung der Einbankverzeirung im Augsburg des 16. Jahrhunderts, pp 258-65, Gutenberg-Jahrbuch 1995. This volume was later in the collection of Percy Lubbock (1879-1965), author and essayist (see DNB); it is inscribed by him and dated Kings College Cambridge 1903.

He was employed as secretary and librarian to  Fugger in Augusburg from 1551 to 1557. That year he became professor of Greek and rector of the newly-founded Augsburg gymnasium, which he directed until his death. One of the leading classical scholars of his day, he is especially noted for his important editions of the works of Isocrates and Demosthenes.  There are two inscriptions in Wolf¹s hand on the front and rear pastedowns recording that Wolf received this volume from Fugger in exchange for Italian and French editions of Demosthenes and Isocrates and the Cornucopia of Perottus, on May 12, 1557. Wolf was librarian and latin secretary to Fugger from 1551 to 1557. Interestingly, Fugger had offered this position previously to Gesner, who had declined. Wolf was later rector of St Anna's Gymnasium and librarian of the Staatsbibliothek in Augsburg.  No similar association copies are recorded in Lehmann¹s work on the Fugger libraries. There are also marginal notes in Wolf¹s hand; one in the De avium mentions S. Osterman, presumably Dr Simon Ostermann, director of the Lauinger Gymnasium, to which Wolf was to leave his library upon his death. In 1638 the  library passed to the Jesuit college of Neuburg, and this is recorded on the title, along with a note on the Wolf provenance.  There is also a quotation from from Celsus written in brown ink on the lower cover in Wolf's hand.","Gesner, Conrad1554-1.jpg","Gesner, Conrad1554-2.jpg",,"Gesner, Conrad1554-3.jpg","Gesner, Conrad1554-4.jpg",E8,25000,18600,"(£15,000)=£13,000",,2521300,1821194

This is a history and bio-bibliography of surgery and surgeons, one of the first of its kind, and covers some 150 authors. It is the only medical bibliography by Gesner since Book XX of the Pandectarum was never published.  The other texts in the volume include Guido Guidi's versions of Galen, Oribasius and Heliodorus, Jean Tagault's De chirurgica institutione, works by Houllier, Jacopo Dondi, Mariano Santo, Angelo Bolognini, Biondo, and Hans Lange, as well as Bartolomeo Maggi's and Alfonso Ferri's treatises on gunshot wounds.

The woodcuts include skeletal illustrations taken from Vesalius, depictions of field surgery from Gersdorff, and reduced versions of the figures in Guido Guidi's Chirurgia. The blocks were cut by Jos Murrer.
See Heirs of Hippocrates 309 for detailed summary.  Indistinct signature on titlepage: ?ex libris/ Saucerotte/ 1786.  The date is appropriate for the surgeon Nicolas Saucerotte (1741-1814).

Iowa: Edited and compiled by Gesner, this extensive collection of surgical works also contains a brief tract by him on the historical importance of surgery as well as a list of notable surgeons and their works from the time of Hippocrates. Nearly a third of the work is devoted to the six books of Tagault’s surgery (see No. 190). The sixth book, De material chirurgica, was written by Houllier (see No. 254). In addition to Compendium chirurgiae, several other surgical tracts by Santo (see No. 154) have been included by Gesner. Santo’s important tract on lithotomy is included, in which he describes his famous technique for the operation employing a lateral incision. Bolognini (see No. 128) was professor of surgery at Bologna where he achieved a great reputation for his achievements in anatomy and surgery. In De cura ulcerum exteriorum he describes the causes and means of curing a wide variety of external sores and ulcers. In De unguentis he discusses the merits, uses, and preparation of a large number of different kinds of salves and ointments. Biondo, a native of Venice, studied medicine at Naples and maintained a flourishing practice in Rome. In De partibus ictu sectis citissime sanandis, et medicamento aquae nuper inuento he explains how warm water may be employed in treating wounds; he was the first to disagree with Galen’s notion that warm water was harmful to wounds. De origine morbi Gallici deque ligni Indici ancipite proprietate is his brief tract on the history of syphilis and its treatment with guaiacum. Maggi was professor of anatomy and surgery at Bologna and the personal physician of Pope Julius II. Maggi strongly supported Pare’s opposition to the use of hot oil and cautery for treating gunshot wounds and performed a number of experiments to support his ideas. His major work, included here by Gesner, was first published in 1522 and went through a number of editions. In the work, he expresses his views and theories of wound management, includes recommendations and recipes for salves and ointments, and depicts in a series of six plates, the major instruments used in treatment of gunshot wounds. Gesner selected two of Ferri’s (see No. 303) several medical works for his Chirurgia. In his treatise on gunshot wounds, he espouses ideas of wound management that are counter to those of Pare and Maggi. He observed that balls might remain in the body for long periods of time with little or no adverse effects and also recommended ligation in cases of excessive hemorrhage. Ferri developed his own ball extractor and it is depicted in the text, along with instructions for its use. The second work, De carnuncula, is a brief work dealing with strictures and blockages of the urethra. Among the causes noted by Ferri are veneral diseases, especially syphilis. Lange, a native of Silesia, studied at Leipzig where he received a master’s degree in 1514. He studied medicine at Ferrara under Leoniceno (see No. 128), in Bologna under Berengario da Carpi (see No. 160 ff.), and received his medical degree at Pisa in 1522. He returned to his native country following his medical education and served as physician to four Electors for some forty years. He is perhaps best known for his Medicinalium epistolarum miscellanea (Basel, 1554) in which he spoke out against uroscopy in favor of diagnosis based on the patient’s symptoms. In the present book, he includes eleven of his brief essays. Several aspects of wound infections, treatment, and management are covered as well as essays on bloodletting, erysipelas, and enemas. Gesner has also included Galen’s De fasciis and Oribasius’ De laqueis and De machinamentis from Guidi’s Chirurgia (see No. 263). All three of these works are profusely illustrated with many wood blocks. Jacopo Dondi Dall’ Orologio was the first in several generations of a family noted for their contributions to astronomy, physics, mathematics, and medicine. Historians are uncertain about many details regarding the family’s life and works. However, Jacopo appears to have practiced in Chioggia, Venice, and a number of smaller Italian towns during his career. He was the author of several books and the present work is a list of what he considers to be the best of the ancient remedies for a wide variety of medical conditions. He quotes from twenty-seven authors and arranges the remedies alphabetically under the disease condition.

An earlier unauthorized abridgement had been prepared by Lycosthenus and was published as a quarto by Oporinus in 1551.  Simler (1530-1576), one of Gesner's friends and his first biographer, was professor of theology at Zurich where he also taught mathematics and astronomy.  Under Vesalius the second edition of the Fabrica is included with the date 1554.  Spach also listed this edition of Vesalius as 1554.  As expected there is a long entry for Gesner including Historia Animalium published in 1555.  Chirurgia of 1555 is included in the 4 pages of additions compiled by Gilbert Cognato and the inclusion of Vidius in the work is noted under Vidius as is Maggi.

This is probably the dedication copy of this work with Fugger's presentation inscription to his Latin secretary Hieronymus Wolf.  See entry for Book II.  There are 217 woodcuts of birds cut after paintings by Lukas Schan or Schroen (fl. 1526-1550) some of which survive as part of the Felix Platter collection in the Basle University Library. This suite of woodcuts contains the first naturalistic representations of the animal kingdom, and effectively heralds the birth of zoological book illustration. They are the archetypes of much subsequent animal illustrations, even into the 18th century. The third part, concerning birds, of Gessner's zoological encyclopedia.  The indices of names of birds are in 10 languages. Gesner's portrait  (7.1 x 9.9 cm) by Jos Murer, one of the principle illustrators of Historia animalium, is on the verso of the title page and shows him at 39 in 1555.

""The volume on birds was published in 1555, and contains 217 accounts of birds, illustrated with a woodcut for each species. The text includes external appearance, anatomy, distribution, habits, mythology and literature. Gessner included fabulous birds, but was not naive in this respect, and made it clear exactly what they were. He deserves the credit for having seen the need for a popular book on birds 'for the people', and was the subject of many laudatory accounts and bibliographies. However, there is no doubt that this monumental work had a great influence on writers in the coming centuries. Gesner tried to include every known animal, and these are arranged alphabetically. He is believed to have been the first person to make a collection of natural history objects for the purposes of study"" (Walters, 'A consice history of ornithology' pp. 26-27).

The First Printed Catalogue of a Portion of a Public Library 1575:
Hieronymus Wolf, humanist, and librarian to Johann Jakob Fugger, published Catalogus Graecorum librorum manu scriptorum Augustanae bibliothecae. Wolf's slim pamphlet of only 6 leaves listed 126 Greek manuscripts presented by Fugger to the City Library of Augsburg, Fugger's native city. It may be considered the first printed catalogue of a portion of a public library.

Pierre Berès suggests, in an offering of this copy, that this is the 17th century Parisian physician, René Moreau (1587-1656). Moreau held the chairs of medicine and surgery at the Royal College of Medecine in Paris. He was Dean of the Faculty from 1630-1631. 'Sa riche bibliothèque, composée de livres curieux et singulier, fut dispersée après sa mort' (NBG). He was the author of several medical works (see NBG 36 475-6); See Hirsch 4: 260 and Bayle & Thillaye 1: 492-493. Norman: 6: 374; 11: 372 offered a work by Moreau on bloodletting in pleurisy.  Watson had a copy of Spigelius/Casserius 1626-1627 ($32000) with the same signature.  My copy of Doni also has this signature. 

The extensive indices at the beginning of the book give the names of fish in Latin, Greek, German French, Spanish, Italian and English.

The present volume on fish and aquatic animals is a part of his encyclopaedia of plants and animals, the first systematic treatise of the Renaissance. The animals are described in alphabetical order. The Swiss author wrote several texts with illustrations on the fishes of Venice, England, and Germany, which he himself had observed or about which his friends had sent him information. He inserted articles and illustrations by Belon (1551), Rondelet (1554) and Salviani (1554-1558) in his texts. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Gessner was the chief authority on all vertebrate animals. In his preface to the readers of Liber IIII he makes the general statement that very few illustrations are not realistic; with the exception of the fabulous Equus neptuni from Belon's work, and a number of illustrations taken by Olaus Magnus (1555) (Gmelig-Nijboer, 1977). The terrifying drawings of whales of Olaus Magnus, like Balaena erecta (page 138) and Cetis diversis (page 248), are mentioned by Gessner as examples of seamen's fantasy stories. Despite this, the inclusion of these drawings was used by some later authors of textbooks on the history of science to perpetuate the myth that Gessner was an ardent believer in fabulous animals.","Gesner, Conrad1558-1.jpg","Gesner, Conrad1558-2.jpg",from Watson's 2019 copy,"Gesner, Conrad1558-3.jpg","Gesner, Conrad1558-4.jpg",E8,30000,24000,£15000: 3-1-00-$10000; 3-24-00-$5000; 4-16- 00: $9000,B & M,2578800,1867819

The Thierbuch combines Gesner's two books on quadrupeds, the viviparous and oviparous, first published in Latin in 1551 and 1554 respectively. These were translated into German by 'Conrad Forer (d. 1594); a few chapters were translated by Johannes Herold. Forer was a Swiss physician who became later a parson in the city of Winterthur.

A spectacular illuminated copy of first German editions of Gesner's 'Historia Animalium', in fine contemporary German colouring to the more than 1000 woodcuts. This work is a monumental encyclopaedia of the animal kingdom and the first systematic treatise on zoology of the Renaissance. It was 'the most authoritative zoological book between Aristotle and the publication of Ray's classification of fauna in 1693... it remained the standard reference book even as late as Linné [1735]' (Printing and the mind of man)./The 'Thierbuch' combines Gesner's two books on quadrupeds, the viviparous and oviparous, first published in Latin in 1551 and 1554 respectively. These were translated into German by Conrad Forer (d. 1594); a few chapters were translated by Johannes Herold. Forer was a Swiss physician who became later a parson in the city of Winterthur.

The woodcuts were cut after paintings by Lukas Schan, some of which survive as part of the Felix Platter collection in the Basle University Library. The German editions contain a further 24 woodcuts which appear here for the first time./The 'Vogelbuch', Gesner's history of birds, is an abridged translation of the 1555 Latin edition by Rudolf Heusslein, a Swiss physician. The woodcuts are the second important suite of ornithological iconography, being contemporary with those of Belon published the same year. They are the precursors of many of Aldrovandi's illustrations, many of which were copied from Gesner./The 'Fischbuch' was translated from the 1558 Latin edition by Conrad Forer. The woodcuts form the fourth great series of ichthyological illustrations, after Belon (1551), Rondelet (1554) and Salviani (1554), but are also the first general series of marine illustrations (including conchology), not confined to fish.//Wellisch 23/24.4; 25.5; 26.6; Nissen IVB 350 and ZBI 1552, 1555 (with erroneous collations); VD16 G1728; G1734; G1741.

Important edition  of this famous work on the domestic economy of the ideal ancient Roman and Italian Renaissance home, with a virtual tour, itself a tour de force of imaginative writing -- including building, furnishing and household management -- here with the first appearance of Gripaldi's very rich De Verborum Explicatione, a dictionary of architecture and related terms which more than doubled the size of the book. This work subsumed all previous in its encyclopaedic coverage, and is justly considered to be the first architectural  dictionary, and the earliest vocabulary of domestic economy. De Partibus Aedium (On the Parts of the House) presents, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms of the Renaissance household. The book served as a reference work for many wealthy Italians who sought to model their villas on the ancient estates (i.a. Daniello Barbaro's estate at Maser). Contains a glossary of words used by Vitruvius and Celsus. In many ways this edition is a technical dictionary with descriptions of medical, bibliographical and paper making terms.

","A Florentine of noble origin, Bonamici was a lecturer for forty-three years at the University of Pisa, first in logic, and then, from 1565 to 1603, in philosophy. He enjoyed great fame and authority in his day as one of the greatest and most learned peripatetics, and was highly regarded by the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In addition to being a scholar of philosophy and medicine, he was also a man of letters, and a member of the Florentine Academy. He published a work, De Motu that influnced Galileo.  He died on September 29, 1603.  Other possibilities for the signature on the title page are Giovanni Franceso Bonamici (1692-1759) and Francesco Buonamici (1596-1677) both architects. Library stamp of the Discalced Carmelites (Barefoot Carmelites) of Venice on verso.

De Partibus Aedium is not only a description of the construction of a villa from the ground-plan to its completion, but it also describes the manner to furnish and run every part of a country house. It forms an intimate source for our knowledge of Italian architecture and cultural life during the Renaissance. The work contains alphabetically arranged essays on every aspect of domestic economy, architecture and furnishings, including the plumbing and baths, the cellar with the wines and foodstuffs stored there, the kitchen and dining room (with all vessels and appliances), bedrooms, nursery, sickroom, armory, granary, etc. There are innumerable details on objects, implements, function, and decoration, from the kinds of ink and paper supplied in the library to the cosmetics in the women's quarters. Includes descriptions of whatever plants may be found in the garden, fish in the fishpond, birds in the aviary, and animals in the stable or private zoo.  Printed the year after Grapaldi's death, this is the last edition from the original publisher; it contains, in addition to the first appearance of the author's vocabulary (fols. 135-265), the outstanding woodcut portrait of the author (here printed for the first time), plus a new seven-page biography of Grapaldi by Ianus Andreas Albius). The index to the main work is now arranged in alphabetical order. Throughout, this is the most elegant and most accurate of the Ugoleti editions. This work is also significant for the study of papermaking history, cf. Jozef Dubrowski & John S.B. Simmons, Permanence of Early European Hand-made Papers in: Fibres & Textiles in Eastern Europe January / March 2003, Vol. 11, No. 1). 

The original edition was published at Parma by Angelo Ugoleto ca. 1494. Two reprints appeared in 1501 and 1506 and in Strasbourg in 1508.  The book continued to be published until 1618.  The portrait, biography and glossaries appear in this edition for the first time.


THE FIRST MODERN TREATISE ON DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE AND THE FIRST EDITION OF THE FIRST PRINTED ARCHITECTURAL DICTIONARY (ff. 135-264).
Focusing exclusively on “how the perfect home should be built, furnished and run” (Simon, Bib. gastr. 789), Grapaldi tours a villa and its grounds — the larder, dining room, kitchen, baths, nursery, armory, infirmary, pharmacy, gardens, fish pond, fountains, aviary…. THE LIBRARY COMES ALIVE (ff. 114-119) with its armillary sphere, chests of manuscripts, wall cupboards of books and entertaining asides on PAPERMAKING, INK AND COPIES ON VELLUM. There is much on food and wine. G.A. Albio added a biography of the author and a 3000 entry alphabetic subject index.

This first textbook advocating that physicians study anatomy, by the teacher of Vesalius, was first published in 1536. ( Hulst III: 4705) and revised by Vesalius in 1538.  Cushing, in writing about Vesalius, says of this 1539 edition, which was changed by Guenther but not by Vesalius,""This Basel edition of 1539 has textual and other changes from the edition of 1536, but since these were made by Guenther himself, and not by Vesalius, the book is not described."" (Cushing, p. 47.) By this time, Vesalius had edited the work for publication in Venice in 1538. Vesalius is mentioned twice in the present version, once in the text on page 30 and once in the introductory epistle to Ebulino, Archbishop of Cologne on a5. There is also an entry in the index for Vesalius for p. 30.  In the introductory letter, Guinther notes that he was assisted by Vesalius and Servetus.

Many of Vesalius’ additions were taken over, sometimes verbatim, by Guinther in his own revision of 1539, which included a new description of the neck and spine muscles.  O'Malley discusses some of these in detail in his 1964 biography of Vesalius.

Guillemeau was physician to 3 French kings, Charles IX, Henri III and Henri III, and son-in-law of Paré.  He is noted particularly for his contributions to dentistry, ophthalmology, and obstetrics. His Tables anatomiques, based upon his earlier Six tables anatomiques (1571; with Michel de Saint-Pierre), was intended for French surgeons unlearned in Greek or Latin. In later editions, the work was combined with Guillemeau's La chirurgerie françoise. According to Mortimer, Guillemeau's anatomical plates were copies in reverse of the engravings in the Venice, 1560 edition of Valverde's Anatomia del corpo humano, which in turn were copies, with additions, of the Vesalian anatomical woodcuts. The magnificent engraved title is an excellent example of Baroque architectural title design (1594). 

This is the copy offered by Weil 30: 61 (1962) for £245.  He identified Demours as the oculist to Louis XVIII and Charles X  but it is more likely that the date of (18)28 is Antoine Pierre Demours (1762-1836) son of Pierre Demours (1702-1795).  Demours fils was ophthalmologist to Ludwig XVIII and Karl X of Bavaria.  He published Traité des Maladies des Yeux in 1818. (P&C 04: $4750). See Albert 545-548.

FIRST EDITION.

Illustrated with 19 splendid copperplate anatomical engravings, a full-paged engraved portrait of Guillemeau at age 35 signed by A. Valleus, and a fine engraved title page, signed by Léonard Gaultier, with portraits of Hippocrates and Galen, an allegorical figure representing surgery, and four smaller figures, personifications of the four “temperaments”. 
Bound in 18th c. quarter calf and paste-paper boards, light wear at extremities. Internally a very fine copy with a few very light spots on a few text leaves and a short clean tear to lower margin of one leaf, no loss. Early ms. notes on several text leaves, and a small number in upper left corner of title. Excellent.
Provenance: With the attractive 18th c. ink stamp “ex-libris Clozier N°_” on the front pastedown and final leaf. This is presumably the 18th c. surgeon Jean-Philippe Clozier.


Jacques Guillemeau served as physician to no fewer than six kings of France, first as assistant to his mentor Ambroise Paré and then as official Royal Surgeon. Remarkably, Guillemeau performed autopsies on two of those six monarchs, Charles IX in 1574 (under the direction of Paré) and Louis XIII in 1610. Guillemeau was himself the son of a surgeon, and his own son, Charles (b. 1588) continued in this tradition, ably working alongside his father.
Most of Guillemeau’s anatomical plates are mirror-image copies of the engravings in the 1560 Italian translation of Valverde's ‘Historia’, which, as we know, were themselves mostly copies of Vesalius’s woodcuts. As the illustrations of Vesalius, and their subsequent reappearances in the work of Valverde and Guillemeau, make clear, the model of classicism became essential not only for the study of the human body, but also for the cultural and intellectual legitimation of illustrated anatomy textbooks. The printed anatomical body of the sixteenth century was not merely a representation of a lifeless cadaver, but a work of art, a sculpture, an artifact, a spectacle, and a curiosity—a sign invested with a thick accretion of meanings. By representing the classical body, fragmented by time, as re-enlivened through its evisceration—by bringing antiquity back to life on the engraved page—the illustrations of Valverde and Guillemeau helped fuse the sometimes-competing projects of humanism and empiricism, of art and science. They lent new authority to the study of anatomy, and they firmly established the body as a site of fascination, inquiry and knowledge.”(Aaron Wile)
The book is divided in 7 Books, beginning with a study of the skeleton. Ch. 2 covers the digestive and reproductive organs (and, in the case of female anatomy, the breasts) and the urinary system. Ch. 3 concerns the vascular system. Ch. 4 Upper thoracic cavity: heart, lungs. Ch. 5 The head. Ch. 6 The nervous system. Ch. 7 Muscles. The book concludes with a thirteen-page table enumerating and describing diseases.
A special note on Female reproductive anatomy and fetal development:
Plates III and IV in the second book of Guillemeau’s “Tables” are specifically dedicated to female anatomy, with emphasis on the reproductive organs. “Both father and son took a particular interest in obstetric surgery and medicine, and (Jacques) Guillemeau was one of a small group of Parisian surgeons who appear to have been summoned by noble or elite families to attend difficult deliveries… It is undoubtedly proof of Guillemeau’s high reputation that he was called to deliver Mlle Simon, daughter of the late Ambroise Paré, when she was in danger of dying from an acute hemorrhage during labor. There are even indications in some cases families would routinely have Guillemeau attend a birth, even if no complications were anticipated.”(Worth-Stylianou, Pregnancy and Birth in Early Modern France, p. 41)

Second edition in Latin of Guy de Chauliac's Chirurgia magna. Like the 1498 Latin editio princeps, the 1499 edition adds medical and surgical works by Leonardo Bertapaglia, Bruno da Longobucco, Lanfranc de Milan, Rolando, Ruggiero, Theodoricus and Bonaventura de Castello; unlike the earlier edition, it also contains treatises on the eyes by Jesus filius Hali and Canamusali de Baldach. Guy de Chauliac studied medicine and surgery in Montpellier and Paris, and served as the personal physician to Popes Clement VI, Innocent VI and Urban V. His Chirurgia magna, written in the early 1360s, remained a standard surgical text up to the time of Ambroise Paré. The work is a compilation of the best medical ideas of the time, containing very little original material and drawing heavily upon the classical Greek and Arabic medical writings; however, Guy often used his own experience as a basis for criticism of these canonical texts. The book's seven chapters cover a broad range of subjects, from cancers to wounds to dentistry. Of particular interest is Guy's insistence that surgeons study anatomy (""the surgeon who is ignorant of anatomy carves the human body as a blind man carves wood""), and his description, in his chapter on abscesses and tumors, of the Avignon plagues of 1348 and 1360, which he blamed upon the Jews and an evil conjunction of the planets. The book's preface (""Capitulum singulare"") is an essay on the general facts that Guy thought all surgeons should know, including the liberal arts, diet, surgical instruments and operating methods; it also contains a brief history of medicine in the form of notes on earlier physicians and surgeons. Although probably written in Latin, Chirurgia magna was first published in French (1478), with Italian, Catalan, Spanish and Latin editions soon following.

Third edition in Italian, the first in the 16th cent., preceded only by the incunable editions of 1480 and 1493.  Guy de Chauliac (c. 1300-1368), considered one of the great masters of the surgery, began his study of medicine in Toulouse before going to study in Montpellier, the center for medical knowledge in 14th century Europe. He was then in Paris between 1315 and 1320, and around 1325, he became a Master of Medicine and Surgery. After receiving his degree, he went to Bologna to study anatomy under Nicola Bertuccio, from whom he may have learned surgical techniques; subsequently he became pontifical physician of Clement VI in Avignon. Chauliac's seminal work on surgery, Chirurgia magna, was finished in 1363 in Avignon. In seven volumes, the treatise covers anatomy, bloodletting, cauterization, drugs, anesthetics, wounds, fractures, ulcers, special diseases, and antidotes. He describes surgical techniques such as intubation, tracheotomy, and suturing. Garrison-Morton: “The most eminent surgeon of his time; his authority remained for some 200 years … He distinguished the various kinds of hernia from varicocele, hydrocele, and sacrocele, and described an operation for the radical cure of hernia. Chauliac discussed the anatomy of the teeth and their eruption. He also listed the maladies to which the teeth are subject, and their cures, including hygienic rules which for the most part remain true today, He described the double-lever pelican and its method of use, he also records how surgeons were using botanic methods to prevent their patients from feeling pain during operations” [...] it is the greatest surgical text of the time”.

The importance of the Chirurgia lies not in its description of technical advances but in its systematization of surgery and its recognition of the responsibilities of the surgeon and the needs of his patients, which have not changed in the six hundred years since the work was written.... The Chirurgia is one of the landmarks in the history of surgery. With its 3,300 references to more than one hundred authors, including numerous quotations from Avicenna, Albucasis, Rhazes, Haly Abbas, Hippocrates, and Galen, it represented the most complete compilation of surgical material prepared to that date, and it remained authoritative in Western medicine until the seventeenth century. The book’s seven sections cover a broad range of subjects, from cancers to wounds and fractures to dentistry.

Title page with printer's device of a scholar under an olive tree in imitation of Henri Estienne's. Large medallion portrait of the editor Laurent Joubert repeated at recto of c2 and **8, over 50 detailed illustrations of surgical instruments.

First edition of Joubert's translation of the most comprehensive survey of surgical knowledge of the 14th century, written by the most influential surgeon of the time, bound here with a first edition of Joubert's annotations on the work. The Grande Chirurgie draws from no less than 88 authorities, most prominently Galen, as well as heavily from Arabic sources such as Avicenna. The work begins with a discussion of areas of knowledge Chauliac believed surgeons must have prior to successfully treating patients; the liberal arts including astronomy, dietary needs, surgical instruments, and the history of the profession. This is followed by seven tracts: on anatomy, tumors and abscesses and the airborne diseases which cause them, open wounds, ulcers, fractures and dislocations of the bone, pathologies that affect specific parts of the body such as leprosy, and finally a list of about 750 medical remedies and antidotes. It is prefaced by an extraordinarily comprehensive alphabetic index of diseases, medical conditions, and treatments.

Laurent Joubert (16 December 1529, Dauphiné, France - 21 October 1582, near Montpellier, France) was a French physician. He travelled to Montpellier at the age of 21 to study medicine, and became a student of Guillaume Rondelet, the chancellor of the Medical Faculty at the University of Montpellier. Soon after Rondelet's death in 1556, Joubert succeeded him as chancellor. He was later summoned by Catherine de' Medici, the queen consort of France, to be her personal physician.

Although, following Leland, Brito is often described as English, there seems no reason to doubt that the author of this work was the Franciscan friar, commended for his learning, met by Salimbene de Adam in Vienne and Lyon in 1249, and that his name denotes his origin in Brittany (DNB). The Vocabularium was his most important and influential work and provided explanations, derivations -- sometimes from the Greek or Hebrew -- and etymologies for the most difficult words in the Vulgate Bible. All were arranged in alphabetical order and, demonstrating his wide knowledge, were drawn from a range of classical, patristic and medieval writers. This dictionary had a wide circulation and was regarded as an essential scholarly tool: already in 1284 it was one of the three texts that Archbishop John Pecham instructed Merton College, Oxford to buy to be kept to be chained to a table in the library and thereby available for the instruction of poor and orphaned members of the founder's family. Although at least 130 manuscript copies survive we can find no record of one being offered for auction. The first printed edition was issued in Ulm around 1476 under the name Henricus de Hassia (Goff H-37).",,"HENRICUS de HASSIA [LANGENSTEIN, pseudo-]. [GULIELMUS BRITO]. Vocabularius Bibliae.

A Sammelband of two Biblical aids for clerical use: the only incunable edition of a dictionary of the Bible, and a handbook of examples of virtues and vices found in scriptures. UNPRESSED AND UNRESTORED, THIS COPY PROVIDES A VERITABLE SHOWCASE OF THE TRACES LEFT BY THE PRINTING PRACTICES OF THE ULM PROTOTYPOGRAPHER JOHANN ZAINER.
1) Vocabularius Bibliae: ONLY EDITION. The colophon’s attribution of the work to the important 14th-century theologian and scholar Heinrich von Langenstein is apocryphal; it is now attributed to the chronicler and poet Guillelmus Brito (Guillaume de Breton). The text is prefaced by a catchy 16-line poem promoting its utility.
With his older brother Gunther Zainer, Johann Zainer had learned printing with Mentelin in Strassburg; he then worked with Gunther in Augsburg. His move to Ulm ca. 1472 seems to have resulted from the influence of the Ulm town physician and humanist Heinrich Steinhöwel (d. 1478), who, lacking a local printer, had entrusted two of his translations (of Apollonius of Tyre and of Boccaccio’s tale of Griseldis) to the distinguished Augsburg printer in 1471. It would have been only natural that he should set the younger Johann up in business in Ulm. Johann Zainer’s first dated book (Steinhöwel’s Regimen wider die Pestilenz) was completed in January 1473. Steinhöwel’s financial backing enabled Zainer to assemble an impressive array of printing material, including woodcut borders, illustrative blocks, and several alphabets of initials. After the deaths of both Steinhöwel and his brother in 1478, Zainer’s press fell into financial difficulties, and he had to leave the city in 1493.
This large, fine copy of a handsome edition is noteworthy on several counts. First, the edition contains a very large assortment of Zainer’s lovely woodcut initials, which were carefully colored in red in the printer’s shop. Being a dictionary, the edition includes a nearly full set of Zainer’s 10-line alphabet (BMC 3a and 3b), onamented with rope- work and occasionally with hatching. It omits only the W and the Y, and one of the 5 or 6 versions of E, but, unusually for a Latin text, includes the K (for Kalendae). Remarking on the presence in this edition of 5 different initials E and 4 different S’s, Bolton suggests that these frequently used letters required several replacement blocks because the hatched lines were vulnerable to breakage (p. 51).
Claire Bolton stated that she chose Zainer for her remarkable case study of fifteenth-century printing practices “because he was a clumsy printer, leaving many marks on his printed pages” (p. 11). Three of these marks are evident in this edition: poor inking, frequent blind impressions of bearer type, and cloth impressions. Zainer was never as skilled a printer as his brother, and a critical eye can discern in this copy as in his other books relatively frequent examples of smudged type and of the inking of elements of the types and formes that should have been lift uninked. More unusual, and strikingly evident in this unpressed copy, is his often unnecessary use of bearer type. Lines of blind-impressed bearer type are found at the foot of all pages containing fewer than the full 34 lines, notably in the first quire and the final page. The shorter pages have up to 6 lines of bearer type, consisting of rows of paragraph marks as well as sorts (including lines of text from elsewhere in the quire: cf. Schäfer / von Arnim  nn   150, note 5). In fact, the Vocabularius Bibliae has the highest number of instances of bearer type of any of Zainer’s imprints (cf. Bolton, p. 135). Oddly, Bolton’s printing experiments showed her that bearer type was not needed for balancing the platen for pages that were “only three or four lines short of the standard,” and yet Zainer used it, liberally.
Finally, the unpressed condition of this copy makes it easy to see several cloth impression marks, long noticed in Johann Zainer’s imprints, which extend beyond the text block but usually not to the edges of the sheets of paper. Several theories for these marks have been proposed, but Bolton has proven through systematic experimentation that the impressions were made by linen cloths used to dampen the paper in preparation for printing (chapter 5). Through her rigorous analysis of the cloth impression marks in books printed by Zainer she was able to reveal aspects of his printing practice, notably the fact that he was still using a one-pull press throughout the 1470s (p. 191). While the leaves in this copy were not checked exhaustively, spot-checking of the first and last few quires reveals cloth impression marks on fols. 1/10, 2/3, 3/4, 3/5, 4/1, 26/6, 26/8, 27/6, 28/1, and 28/6.

2) Nicolaus de Hanapis: Third Eggestein edition and the third of four incunable editions. The work is a somewhat shortened version of Nicolaus de Hanapis’ Virtutum vitiorumque exempla, “`a Christian imitation of Valerius Maximus,’ in which examples drawn from Holy Writ are arranged under graduated subject-headings after the time- honoured manner of the pagan author” (Scholderer). This abbreviated version presents the subjects in alphabetical order. BMC’s original misattribution to Bonaventura is corrected in Scholderer’s lithographically reproduced manuscript notes.

36. Herodotus. Historiae libri novem. - Venice, Johannes and Gregorius de Gregoriis, de Forlivio, 8 March 1494.
Folio; 8 ll., 134 ll., 4 additional leaves with a calligraphic and rubricated manuscript index dated 1497; 2 blank ll. the incipit of text is surrounded by a large “early renaissance” woodcut border, white on black, and illustrated by a woodcut inset of a man Apollo?) laurel-crowned crowning Herodotus with laurel while he is writing; hand-colored blue initial. old calf (chamois), original leather ties partially preserved. Few small worm-holes in the first leaves. nice copy, with good margins. Third edition of Herodotus containing the first appearance of the famous and beautiful woodcut border considered “probably the most splendid of all examples of decorative art applied to book in the renaissance” (Lippmann). The woodcut, usually shaved to fit the page size, survives in our copy in a perfect condition and impression. The elaborate black background includes a cartouche at the top with a satyr and a ram, and at the bottom a mythological scene. the large vignette within the frame shows Herodotus receiving laurel. the debate about the attribution of these woodcuts is still open: the unknown “master of the border of the Herodotus” is sometimes connected with the Poliphilus master (Essling) or with Simon Perigrini (Pollard).  It appears in several other later works including a Paris edition of Boccaccio of Des nobles malheureux of 1538.

Born in the Persian-controlled city of Halicarnassus, Herodotus was the author of a nine-book account of the wars between the Greek states and Persia (490–479 B.C.E.) and of Persian gods and kings, geographies, and ethnic origins of conquered populations, enlivened by digressions on noteworthy personalities, local lore, rumors, and sex. On completion, it was the longest prose work in Greek up to its time and remains the earliest major historical narrative to have survived from antiquity. Herodotus’s historiai (investigations) were based on exhaustive research and far-flung travels throughout the Hellenic realm, the Persian Empire, and beyond to the Scythian Black Sea coast. In his later years, Herodotus became renowned for paid public recitations of his work-in-progress and was alleged to have gained both fame and fortune by extolling Athens at the athletic games in Olympia. Long considered the first true historian, Herodotus was, above all else, interested in telling a compelling story.

Lorenzi Valla (1407–1457), one of the most influential of the early Renaissance humanists, produced a number of corrected Latin translations of sacred and classical Greek texts, including Aesop’s fables and the histories of Thucydides (1452) and Herodotus (1457), both commissioned by Pope Nicholas V.

The 1494 edition of Valla’s translation of Herodotus’s Historiae, open here to its title page, is a rare instance of an early printed edition of an ancient text adorned by any illustration. Within the white-on-black woodcut frame is a central panel showing Herodotus crowned with laurel by Apollo in a fifteenth-century–style study. The scene below depicts the Near Eastern mother of the gods, Cybele, with her lover Attis and other figures and includes a loom bearing the initials S C P I, thus possibly identifying the designer of the woodcut as the obscure engraver Stefano Pellegrini da Cesena.","de Croÿ p. 84; Galloys F635 (1502 Aldus); Bentes II: 275 (1502 Aldus); Desmarets F1879 (1502 Aldus); Hohendorf F606 (1474); Petaviana 1722: F1640 (1474); Huls I: F2966 (1474), F2967 (1502 Aldus); Burmann I: F345 (1502 Aldus); Harley I: 4470  & III: 1176 (1475); Pellet F142 (1502 Aldus); Maittaire I: 48.191; Salthenius 306 (1502 Aldus); Emtinck III: 25.215 (1502 Aldine); Mortimer 1753: F60 (1502 Aldus),F69 (1475); De Crassier 1877 (1474); Mead F1598 (1502 Aldus); Folkes 2818 (1502 Aldus); de Selle 1843 (1474); Gaignat 2855 (1502),2857 & 2858 (1474); Askew 1915 (1502 Aldus),1916 (1475); Crevenna V: 100 (1474); Meyzieu 2181 (1474); Beauclerk I: 2304 (1502 Aldus); La Vallière 83: 4827 (1502),4828 (1474); Pinelli 1789: 7420 (1502 Aldus); Laire I: 338 (1474),364 (1475); Thott VII: F2114 (1502 Aldus); Loménie de Brienne 92: 412 (1502 Aldus); Fossi I: 770-771 (312 x 210); Mérigot 2950 (1475); Boutourlin 1805: 3038; Servais 2336 (1474); Caillard 1986 (1502 Aldus); Chenier 797 (1502 Aldus); Heath 2883 (1502 Aldus); Roxburghe 7493 (1502 Aldus),7496 (1475); Ebner 661b (1502 Aldus); Willett/Willett/Merly 1191 (1502 Aldus); Larcher 1699 (1502 Aldus); MacCarthy-Reagh 4279 (1475); Talleyrand 950 (1502 Aldus); Roscoe 297 (1475),298 (1502 Aldus),299; Hultman 101; Fonthill 2280 (1502 Aldus); Sykes I: 1379* (1502 Aldus); Meerman III: 8.73 (1474); Drury 2024 (1502 Aldus); Hibbert 3765 (1502 Aldus); Coulon 2800 (1502 Aldus);  Boutourlin Inc: 89 (1474); Hanrott II: 1286 (1502 Aldus),1288 (1475); Heber I: 3467 (1474); Heber VII: 2882 (1502 Aldus); Heber X: 1735 (1474); Kloss 2001 (this copy); Freeling 1343 (1474); Boutourlin 1839: 2125 (1474); Douce; Stowe House 2638 (1502 Aldus); Payne & Foss I: 2336 (1502 Aldus); Dawson Turner 53: 1545 (1502 Aldus); Bearzi 3092 (1502 Aldus); Hosmer 490 (1502); Corser III: 492 (1474); Desbarreaux-Bernard II: 885 (1502 Aldus); Firmin-Didot I: 675 (1502 Aldus); Sunderland 6102 (1474); Hamilton 995 (1474); Syston Park 910; Wodhull 1255 (1474),1266 (1502 Aldus); Ledeboer 708 (1502 Aldus); Brooke p. 673 (Pillone binding); Eugène Piot II: 2522; de Vinne 578 (1474); Holford II: 342 (1502 Aldus); Todd 230 (1592 Aldine); Gougy II: 630; Dyson Perrins 135 (310 x 211); Wilmerding II: 305 (1502 Aldus);","Provenance: ex libris “Georgius Kloss, m. d.

(Woodcut border slightly shaved at top, some pale marginal dampstaining at beginning and end, pale stain on several leaves in quires c and d, h2.5 and i3.4 browned.) 18th-century limp vellum, portions of ties preserved (some soiling). Provenance: marginalia throughout in an early hand (some cropped); acquired from Lathrop C. Harper, 1977.
 
This third edition, preceded by those of 1474 (Venice: Jacobus Rubeus) and 1475 (Rome: Arnoldus Pannartz), is celebrated for having one of the finest woodcut borders of the 15th century. The black-on-white border shows Renaissance ornament and two white-ground insets, the upper of a faun preparing to sacrifice a goat and the lower Hercules at the parting of the ways. It frames a larger cut of the crowning of Herodotus by Apollo and the incipit. Essling saw the hand of the Poliphili Master in these fluid cuts. HC *8472; BMC V, 345 (IB. 21058); Bod.-Inc.

","First collected edition of 80 Hippocratic works translated from Greek into Latin by Marco Fabio Calvo (d. 1527 in the sack of Rome).  The first edition of the Greek texts was published in 1526.  The work is dedicated to Clement VII.   Calvo was physician to Pope Clement VII and also wrote about ancient Rome.  'Hippocrates first established an empirical system of medicine based on a combination of bedside experience and a collation of the many individual data which then formed the basis of clinical teaching. The clinical descriptions of fevers, phthisis, peurperal convulsions, epilepsy and other disorders have remained classics and no such records were kept again for over a thousand years. 'The treatise on surgery includes treatment of dislocations and fractures, trephining the skull, descriptions of surgical instruments, rules on public health and diagnosis, a famous work on the brain, on the theory of the four humours, and many others. Laennec specifically acknowledges his debt to the Hippocratic writings in relation to his invention of the stethoscope. The most celebrated section of all is probably the ""Aphorisms."" 'The ideal of the humane and learned physician originates with Hippocrates, and the ""Hippocratic Oath"" still remains the classic expression of the duties, ethics and moral standards of the medical profession' (Printing and the mind of man 55)' 
This edition publishes the Latin translation from the Greek made by Marco Fabio Calvo, who had prepared his own Greek manuscript in 1512 by collating a fourteenth century manuscript in his possession with a twelfth-century codex which remains one of the oldest and most important Hippocratic manuscripts. Both manuscripts, along with Calvo's recension, survive in the Vatican Library. Greek text published in 1526 by Aldus utilised another version of the Hippocratic texts.  Calvo also published Aniquae Urbis Romae (ep 1527, 1532 & 1556).

The 14th century manuscript and both of Calvo's autograph manuscripts are illustrated in Rome Reborn, of which there is also an abbreviated online version.  Marco Fabio Calvo based his transcription and translation of the corpus on this fourteenth- century manuscript in the mistaken belief that it was of great antiquity. 

Calvo originally planned to publish a Greek edition as well as a Latin translation of the complete Hippocratic corpus and transcribed the whole Greek text from the older manuscript.

Marco Fabio Calvo's Latin translation of the Hippocratic corpus was completed in 1515 and printed at Rome in 1525, by Francesco Calvo, then ""apostolic printer"" to the papacy. The following year Marco Fabio deposited this holograph manuscript of his Latin translation in the papal library, so that it could serve as an archetype (official text) for future editions of his work. The papal library thus still served as a library of record, as it had for Lorenzo Valla 75 years before.",Hippocrates1525-3.jpg,Hippocrates1525-4.jpg,B1,50000,36000,£25000 ($50000),,2772550,2062319

Iowa: Leonhart Fuchs (see No. 241 ff.) was a brilliant student and received his baccalaureate degree at Erfurt, when only seventeen and a master's degree from Ingolstadt in 1521. He continued at Ingolstadt and three years later graduated in medicine. In 1535, after several years of practice and teaching, he became professor of medicine at Tübingen where he remained until his death. He was opposed to the study of Arabic writers on medicine arguing that the classic medical authors should be read and studied in the original Greek. As a result, he made many translations of the great classical authors and prepared numerous commentaries on their writings. The present volume is his commentary on Hippocrates' Aphorisms in which he includes not only his own commentary but often the comments and notes of Galen (see No. 36 ff.). The text of each aphorism is given in Greek as well as Latin and the commentary is in Latin.

First edition of Janus Cornarius's classic Latin translation of the collected works of Hippocrates, beautifully printed by Froben in Basel, the present copy used as printer's copy for Valgrisi's Venice edition in the same year 1546. Surviving examples of printer's copy, that is, the actual physical exemplar used by the compositor or compositors to set a new edition, are ""unique resources for insight into printing-house practices ... witnesses to how the production of a book was planned, and how it grew under the compositors' hands"" (Hellinga, Texts in transit, pp. 37-38). Examples from the first half of the 16th century, whether manuscripts or marked-up printed books, are quite rare, and examples prepared and used in different printing offices may reveal different practices.
In 1538, Cornarius had edited Froben and Episcopius's Greek edition of Hippocrates's works, which long remained the standard text. His translation for their present Latin edition also set the standard that was followed by all others: Erasmus called it a work of ""genius"". Several publishers in several countries reprinted it already later in the same year.
With a mostly marginal stain in the colophon leaf and a few others, occasional dirt, smudges and minor marginal stains or foxing, and a small corner torn off 1 leaf, but still in good condition and only slightly trimmed. The binding is tattered, lacking most of the backstrip and with chips and abrasions. P.G. Bietenholz & T.B.

UGO BENZI (c. 1370-1439), called Hugh of Siena, was Professor of Medicine at Siena, then at Bologna and at Parma, and appears to have given lectures at the Sorbonne. Returning to Italy, he was called by Nicholas III to Ferrara, where he took part in the celebrated Council of 1417. He was perhaps the best interpreter of the ancient medical writers amongst his contemporaries. His Consilia are of interest on account of their clinical reports.

Contains 83 consilia by Benzi and two by other authors.  The 1496-1499 edition provides another 27 consilia. Benzi's consilia are among the earliest written (1420-1438), but printed after those of Montagnana (1476), Antonio Cermisone d. 1441 (1476) and Ferrari da Grado, Giovanni Matteo d. 1472 (1480). The earliest on record are those of Taddeo Alderotti (fl. 1250). Later editions appeared in 1503 and 1518. Gentile da Foligno (1488), Baviera (1489).

Ugo Benzi was professor of medicine at Siena, Pavia, and Padua, and appears to have taught at the Sorbonne. The compilation of consilia was an innovation in Western medicine beginning at the time of Ugo Benzi. This increasing body of direct observation formed a counter to the authority of the texts of Hippocrates and Galen, and helped lead to the liberation of medicine from classical authority. Ugo Benzi’s consilia are especially important for the first accurate diagnoses of epilepsy, cancer of the nose and throat, asthma, and lipothomia.

There are 5 full page woodcuts, 2 of which depict the brain, ventricles and cranial nerves.  Smaller woodcuts in the text depict other organs including the sutures of the skull.  The woodcut of the brain is preceded by incunable editions of Albertus Magnus, Ludovicus of Prussia's (1498) and Johann Peyligk (1499) with schematic illustrations of the cerebral ventricles and the functions residing within them.  The ventricular plate appears here twice and is certainly the basis of Dryander's more refined illustration of 1536 and 1537.  This is a large copy with deckle edges on many leaves.
 It contains the most complete representation of all the viscera published up to that time. The five full-page woodcuts consist of two identical representations of the human head, an entire body, a hand with chiromantic markings and the internal organs of the thorax. The smaller cuts distributed throughout the text include plates of the stomach, intestines, eye and cranium. Even though by this time dissection had been practiced in Europe for about two hundred years, these illustrations, by an unknown artist, are schematic devices rather than drawings done at a dissection. They do not appear to have been intended to correspond to anatomical reality. For example a woodcut of the body includes the names of all the external parts but makes no attempt to equate the anatomical terms with the parts they describe. Woodcuts like these are more like a visual way of listing the main organs, such as a table in a modern book might indicate relationships.
Like most of his contemporaries, Hundt believed in the influence of the stars on the human body, and incorporated remarks on chiromancy into his text. He also subscribed to the Galenic notion of the seven-celled uterus. Hundt's Antropologia provides a clear picture of late fifteenth-century anatomical concepts prior to the work of Berengario da Carpi.","Rivinus 2540; Platner II: 2267; Guenz II: 4162 (1529 medical work); Wittwer I: Q440,Q1476a; Panzer 985; Baldinger 2394; Libri 1861: 3756; Davidson 1637;",Provenance: From the Library of the Brooklyn Academy of Medicine,"Magnus Hundt was born in Magdeburg in 1449 and began his studies in Leipzig at the age of 33, receiving a Baccalaureate in 1484. In 1487, the year he received his advanced degree, he was appointed dean of the Faculty of Arts, and in 1499 he became rector of the University. At some point in his career he is believed to have served as physician to Count Schlick of Joachimsthal. His interests went beyond medicine, and in 1510 he received a doctorate in theology and held a chair in same subject at the University in Meissen, where the University of Leipzig had relocated because of the plague. He died in that city in 1519. During his lifetime, Hundt, also known as Magnus Hund and Magnus Canis (""Big Dog"" in Latin), composed a book on grammar, commentaries on St. Augustine and Pierre Lombard, and diverse philosophical works.

Magnus Hundt's Antropologium, published in Leipzig in 1501, serves to explain the body not only anatomically and physiologically, but philosophically and religiously too. Humans were created in the image of God and represent a microcosm of the world as God created it. Antropologium contains 17 woodcut illustrations of human anatomy, one of which, the human head on the verso of the title page, is repeated once. The illustrations are schematic, rather than accurate depictions. Some of the smaller images first appeared, though often in a more crude form, in Johann Peyligk's Philosophie Naturalis Compendium (Leipzig: Melchior Lotter, 1499).

The series of woodcuts constitutes the earliest printed representation of the constellations. The woodcuts, attributed to Santritter, derive from medieval manuscript sources and depict figures in medieval European costume. The text is attributed to Hyginus the mythographer and based on Greek sources, particularly Aratos' Phaenomena. Blending myth and science, the work explains the basics of astronomy, the 42 constellations and the zodiac. The text was first published in an unillustrated edition in Ferrara in 1475.
Dowling: FIRST ILLUSTRATED EDITION of Hyginus’ “Poeticon Astronomicon”, illustrated with 47 half-page woodcuts of the constellations and the planets personified. The text is set in a pleasing Gothic. The text of Hyginus was first published in an unillustrated edition at Ferrara in 1475.The “Poeticon Astronomicon” (more correctly, the “Astronomica”) is an ancient Roman work on the constellations chiefly based on the work of the Greek scientist Eratosthenes (3rd c. B.C.). The work was traditionally attributed to the first century writer C. Julius Hyginus, the Director of the Palatine Library under the Emperor Augustus, but the extant text is now believed, based on stylistic analysis, to be an abridgement of Hyginus’ work made in the late second century. The fact that the order of the constellations in the poem follows precisely that of Ptolemy’s “Almagest” further strengthens the casgrapaldi
e for a second century date. A remarkable aspect of Hyginus’ text is his insistence on the use of astronomical models, in particular, a celestial globe, as an aid to teaching or explaining astronomical principles and phenomena, particularly for “discussions on the inter-relationships between the constellations and especially between the constellations and the celestial circles.”(Lippincott p.4)Like Manilius’ “Astronomicon” and Proclus’ “Sphaera” (a text that Hyginus sought to improve upon), the “Poeticon Astronomicon” was of special interest to early astronomers –including Copernicus- who desired accurate editions of ancient texts from which they might derive a clear understanding of the astronomical knowledge of the Romans and Greeks, thereby establishing a firm foundation upon which to undertake astronomy’s “renewal”.One of the chief interests in Ratdolt’s edition of Hyginus lies in the illustrations of the constellations, the first such illustrations to appear in a printed book. These images derive from medieval sources such as those found in manuscripts and paintings –though a specific source has not been identified. The figures appear in medieval European costume and, in the words of Redgrave, “There is a vigour and quaintness about these woodcuts which merit recognition.” Hyginus gives detailed accounts of the myths associated with each of the constellations, and these myths served as source material for artists in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, one of the most famous examples of the text’s influence being the splendid ceiling painted around 1511 by Peruzzi for Agostino Chigi in the Sala di Galatea of the Villa Farnesina (See Förster, Farnesina-Studien 1880, p. 40). In many instances these medieval European, often mythological, constellation figures differed notably from those used by Ptolemy and his Islamic successors ... Several stylistic conventions, first published in Ratdolt's woodcuts, endured for several centuries, both in the numerous editions of Hyginus and in the various maps derived therefrom.The Contents of Hyginus’ “Poeticon Astronomicon”Hyginus tells us that he intends to give a better description of the celestial sphere than Aratus had done in his “De Sphaera”. Book I gives a brief overview of the cosmography of the universe, the celestial sphere, the Earth and its zones, and the Zodiac. Book II is a compendium of myths related to the constellations, the five planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter) as well as the Sun, Moon, and Milky Way.Book III is Hyginus’ star catalogue. It is in this book that Ratdolt’s woodcuts appear. “Each constellation is described (in the same order as in Book II) in terms of its location relative to the surrounding constellations and the celestial circles, with some indications being given as to the overall shape and disposition of the figure. In addition, Hyginus provides a list of the positions of the stars relative to the figure itself, describing the placements in terms of ‘left’ and ‘right’ and ‘above’ and ‘below’, in line with the tradition of descriptive star catalogues. Moreover, he tends to list the stars from the top of a figure downwards (or from the head to the feet, regardless of the orientation of the figure within the sky). This is very different from the way the more mathematically oriented astronomers such as Hipparchus or Ptolemy describe the constellations.“Book IV returns to the subject of cosmology and to astronomical topics, such as the position of the constellations on each celestial circle, the unequal division of the night and day and the risings and settings of the constellations relative to the signs of the zodiac. He discusses the movements of the Sun and the Moon and the five planets and touches upon Pythagorean notions of the harmony of the spheres.” (Lippincott, Kristen “The textual tradition of the De Astronomica of Hyginus”, pp. 10-11)

Latude: (this copy): First illustrated edition and second edition for the text. These 47 woodcuts are the earliest printed representation of constellations and planets. These illustrations influenced celestial atlas imagery for over a century. They were designed by Johannes Lucilius Santritter, or under his supervision. Title printed in red on five lines on folio a2. The text, attribued to Hyginus (64 BC - AD 17), is based on Aratus' Phaenomena and mix physical knowledge and stellar legends. But, the star lists in the ""Poeticon astronomicon"" is in exactly the same order as in Ptolemy's Almagest, and it leads to the idea of a 2nd-century compilation. It was published for the first time in Ferrara in 1475 without illustrations. Collation : [a-f8, g8, without a1 blank]. Sheet a3 is signed b3. As in the British Museum's copy sheet d3 is here signed c3, but this is not the case of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. In our copy, the verso of folio g1 is signed g2, a difference with all the copies we can see on line. These two errors could be a sign of an early issue. The last copy at auction (New-York, Apr. 09, 2013) was sold for $ 40 000.

Council of Trent (1545-1563): Pope Paul III (1534-1549); Pope Julius III (1550-1555);  Pope Pius IV (1559-1565).  The northern Italian city of Trent was the venue of an ecumenical council at three meetings held in 1545-9, 1551-2 & 1562-3. It helped to define more precisely the doctrines of the Roman Church in opposition to those of the Reformation. This is evident in the Council's rejection of the protestant views on original sin and in the reaffirmati on of the doctrine of transubstantiation. Although papal autocracy was strengthened since the Council depended on the Pope's consent to validate decrees, the Council ultimately secured the future spaxiritual efficiency of the Roman Church, as when provision was made for the establishmnet of seminaries for the training of the clergay in every diocese.

The work presents the Ten Rules which until 1897 defined the books that should be banned.  Under each letter, books and authors are divided into three classes: authors condemned with all their writings; certain prohibited books of authors; and pernicious books by anonymous authors.  The principle of a list of forbidden books was adopted at the Fifth Lateran Council in 1515, then confirmed by the Council of Trent in 1546. The first edition of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, dated 1557 was published by Pope Paul IV in Rome. The 32nd edition, published in 1948 included 4000 titles. The Index was suppressed in  1966.

Class I: Books by heretical authors, all of whose writings are prohibited.
Class II: Individual prohibited books, classified alphabetically by author.
Class III: Anonymous prohibited books, classified alphabetically by title. 

During its first century of existence the Index librorum prohibitorum listed condemned books in an alphabetical sequence subdivided into the three classes of prohibition. For example, in the exhibited Lyon edition of the 1564 Index, under the letter P, authors of Class I were listed first by name, books in Class II were listed next by author, and anonymous works in Class III were listed last by title. Beginning in 1664, every book in the Index was listed in a single continuous alphabetical sequence, regardless of its class.

This is the first Plantin edition of the papal index.  Another edition with 119 pages was printed in 1570 with additional titles.
The present Catalogue of Prohibited Books supplements and repeats the Index published by the Council of Trent (1564). It contains three specific types of condemned literature: works of authors previously censored, books forbidden by the Index and anonymous writings antagonistic to Sacred Doctrine. Such forbidden works found to be extant were to be burned within three months; their printing, sale and circulation were to be prohibited in the future. The present index was compiled by Arias Montanus (1527-1598). It exerted considerable influence as it laid the foundation for the following Spanish Index of Quiroga and was among ""those expurging indexes"" which prompted the Areopagitica. This ""Antwerp Index was printed by Plantin, who had been designated ""prototypographus ""by Philip II, responsible for all local printers' oaths of fealty to the Crown and to the Church. Bound in with the Edict by Philip II of 15 February 1569 (= 1570 n.st.) in French, Dutch and Latin, in which Philip II of Spain forbids the printing, sale and circulation of Protestant heretical literature and reaffirms the earlier decrees formulated by his father, himself and the Council of Trent (1564). The Edict was formulated by the bloody Duke of Alva and was directed particularly against the circulation of anti-Catholic works in the Netherlands, where many Protestant refugees sought shelter. With an appendix imposed by the Duke of Alva on the Low Countries (1569). Sections in Latin (a large group of Bibles at the end), French, ""Duytsche verboden boeken"" (Dutch with a.o. Reynaert de Vos) and Spanish.
Authors listed: Agrippa., Gesner, Erasmus, Calvin, Zwingli, Rheticus, Henry VIII, Luther, Melancthon, Dolet, Servetus, Nicolas Udall, Rabelais, Robert Estienne, Thomas Platter, the Talmud.

The compilation and printing of this index was ordered by Philip II of Spain, in accordance with the precepts given by the Council of Trente. Plantin printed 750 copies of this apparently secret document for the king; not for sale, but to be distributed among censors, reliable printers and booksellers. The exclusive printing right for this work was accorded to the ''prototypographus regius'', by the Duke of Alba, with the warning not to change the text of the Index. In the struggle against the rising tide of Protestantism, the need for catalogues of forbidden books became obvious.

Ouvrage très rare, comme la plupart des livres du médecin et humaniste Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia (Regalbuto, 1510 - Palerme, 1580), surnommé « l’Hippocrate sicilien ».

La Iatropologia est un recueil de questions et disputes médicales dirigées contre la médecine arabe, concernant aussi bien la chirurgie que les épidémies ; la seconde partie est plus particulièrement consacrée aux blessures du crâne.  Après des études de médecine à Padoue, Ingrassia se rendit à Naples où il enseigna à partir de 1544. Il traduisit et commenta les traités de Galien, fit oeuvre de précurseur dans les domaines de la médecine légale et de la santé publique, et distingua le premier la scarlatine de la rougeole. On lui doit aussi, parmi d’autres découvertes anatomiques, l’identification du petit os de l’oreille appelé étrier. Agréable exemplaire en vélin d’époque.

Ingrassia (ca. 1510-80), after studying medicine at Palermo and Padua, became professor of anatomy and medicine at the University of Naples in 1544. He was called to Palermo in 1556 by the Spanish viceroy of Sicily as protomedicus. In this position, Ingrassia ""was concerned for the most part with problems of hygiene, epidemiology, and the general administration of Sicilian medicine. His activities included efforts to suppress quackery, to control the pharmaceutical trade, and to improve the conditions in hospitals Ingrassia was responsible for the establishment of one of the first sanitary codes and a council of public health. He was also a founder of the study of legal medicine Ingrassia is best known for his anatomical studies, admittedly based upon the methods and procedures of Vesalius, for whom he expressed the greatest admiration.""–D.S.B., VII, pp. 16-17. A pioneer in the study of forensic medicine, hygiene, surgical pathology, and teratology, Ingrassia also discovered the ""stapes"" and denied the existence of the inframaxillary bone. He was also the first to describe scarlatina and was probably the first to recognize chicken-pox as a separate disease. This rare work is concerned with wounds to the head and methods of treatment. It is a collection of questions and disputes, directed against the Arab medical tradition (but very much part of it). Fine copy.

This concilium is particularly important as it is the best evidence we have that Vesalius was a most expert surgeon as well as a great anatomist. Although treatment of empyema by surgery was referred to in classical times, it became unfashionable, and Vesalius seems to have been the first in modern times to revive the actual use of surgery for this illness. His concilium — which appears on pages 92-98 of the second part — was a remarkable piece of surgical writing for his time. Ingrassia’s reply to Vesalius, in which he congratulates him and declares him the first to operate for empyema, is found immediately following the concilium on pages 99-101. The same case also contains a consilium signed by Eustachius.

Abstract


Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia was born five centuries ago in Regalbuto, a small town in the center of Sicily. After his medical course in Padua, under the guidance of Vesalius and Fallopius, he gained international fame as a physician and was recruited as a Professor of human anatomy in Naples and later in Palermo. He is remembered as “the new Galen” or “the Sicilian Hippocrates.” He contributed to the knowledge of human anatomy through the description of single bones rather than the whole skeleton. In particular, he was the first to describe the “stapes,” the “lesser wings of the sphenoid” and various other structures in the head (probably the pharyngotympanic tube) as well as in the reproductive system (corpora cavernosa and seminal vesicles). He was also a pioneer in the study of forensic medicine, hygiene, surgical pathology, and teratology. As Protomedicus of Sicily, he developed the scientific culture in this country. During those years, he faced the spread of malaria and plague with competence and authoritativeness. Indeed, he was one of the first physicians to suppose that certain diseases could be transmitted between individuals, therefore, introducing revolutionary measures of prevention. He is remembered for his intellectual authority and honesty. Five-hundred years after his birth, his teaching is still alive. In this article, we survey the life and contribution of this pioneer of early anatomical study. Clin. Anat. 23:743–749, 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Isidore, évêque de Séville au VIIe siècle, a voulu rassembler dans ces ""Etymologies"" tout ce qu'il est nécessaire de connaitre. S'appuyant sur les auteurs de l'Antiquité, il a cherché à transmettre une culture classique alors en fort déclin.

Cette carte, de type appelé ""T-O"" montre les trois continents connus à l'intérieur d'un cercle, l'Asie occupant la moitié supérieure. Les chapitres scientifiques sont particulièrement intéressants. Isidore traite de mathématiques, d'astronomie, de médecine, de géologie, de botanique, de zoologie. Cet ouvrage a joué un rôle considérable dans la constitution du bestiaire médiéval. ""A cause de la structure des ""Etymologies"", qui rappelle celle de certaines bases de données, et préfigure les inventions futures du classement alphabétique, puis de la notion d'index, Isidore de Séville a été choisi comme saint patron des informaticiens et des internautes.

The books of greatest scientific interest deal with mathematics, astronomy, medicine, human anatomy, zoology, geography, meteorology, geology, mineralogy, botany, and agriculture.

Although the undated (ca. 1467) De sermonum proprietate, sive, Opus de universe of Rabanus Maurus (776–856) has often been cited as the first work with a section on medicine, current research suggests that the earliest possible date for this book is about 1474 which make the early editions of Isidore and the Vocabularis rerum of Zainer, the earliest printed works to discuss medicine as a separate discipline.","Van der Meer p. 22 (1499); Trichet du Fresne x2v (Basil); van der Linden 58: 85 (1577); Gras p. 119 (1577); Sallo p. 86 (Basel ? edition); de Thou  I: 267 (1577); II: 224 (1520); Barberini I: 578 (1473); Broeckhuysen Philol F17 (1520); Carpzov II: 105.52 (1577); de Witt 1701: F1261 (?ed); Bentes III: Human F34 (1520); Gude p. 380 (1578); Galloys F1372 (1577); Ch.

Hain and Klebs list the Mentelin edition first. The dating is said to be not after 1473 based on an ownership inscription in a copy in Bamberg.

This edition includes Isadore's De natura rerum (20 pages) after the third book, headed ""Liber Quartus"" before the regular Liber Quartus (De medicina).

Mentelin probably learned printing from Gutenberg and established the first press in Strasbourg where he printed the third bible and the first German bible.

Incorporated with the present edition of the Etymologiae by way of supplement, though not named in the table of contents, is an earlier treatise of Isidore's entitled De natura rerum, written at the request of Sisebut, king of the Visigoths, 612-621, and dedicated to him. It contains the sum of the physical philosophy of his time, and, being largely astronomical, is sometimes found in the MSS. under the title Liber de astronomia. In order to bring it into immediate connection with the corresponding section of the Etymologiae, it is placed immediately after the third book (devoted to the quadrivium, the last division of which is astronomy) and given irregularly the heading ""Liber quartus,"" the regular Liber quartus (De medicina) beginning twenty pages later. Two of the 48 chapters of which it is composed are wanting here, but by the subdivision of other chapters the [10]number is raised to 58. Zainer of Augsburg, the printer of the first edition of the Etymologiae, dated 19 November, 1472, followed it the next month with an edition of De responsione mundi et astrorum ordinatione ad Sesibutum regem, which is the work in question under another title. Printed with the same type and the same number of lines to the page, it was in effect treated as a supplement to the Etymologiae.

According to the testimony of a fellow printer, de Lignamine, in the ""Chronica summorum Pontificum,"" Rome, 1474, Mentelin as early as 1458 was printing at Strassburg 300 sheets a day. The third Latin Bible (1460-1461) and the first German Bible came from his press, but the first work to which he affixed his name and a date was the Speculum historiale of Vincent of Beauvais in 1473. He died in 1478.

Johannes Mentelin, sometimes also spelled Mentlin, (born around 1410 in Schlettstadt, today Sélestat; died December 12, 1478 in Strasbourg) was a pioneering German book printer and bookseller of the incunabulum time. In 1466, he published the first printed Bible in the German language, the Mentelin Bible.
 
In 1447, Johannes Mentelin gained the rights of a Strasbourg citizen. He was first a ""Goldschreiber"" (calligrapher and book scribe) by profession and worked in addition as an episcopal notary. Exactly when and where he learned the technique of book printing is not known. Since at the end of the 1450s, when Mentelin founded his Strasbourg printery, there was still no other place where printing was done besides Mainz, it is likely that he either got his knowledge directly there or through a middleman. Such a go-between might have been Heinrich Eggestein. It is suspected that he had been introduced to the trade of book printing during his stay in Mainz from Johannes Gutenberg. He did not set up his own Offizin (an old German term for a book printery) until the middle of the 1460s. Due to a lack of sources, the final clarification of this question must unfortunately remain unanswered for now. From the available data, it can however be concluded that Johannes Mentelin was the first book printer active in Strasbourg (and thus one of the first anywhere in Europe), even before Heinrich Eggestein.

The Mentelin bible of 1460 is the second earliest bible printed and was thought to be the first for many years.  In 1466 Mentelin printed the first vernacular bible in German.
 
The first printing which carries Mentelin's name is Augustine's Tractatus de arte praedicandi from the year 1465. However, it is assumed that Johannes Mentelin had already begun to print significantly earlier, probably even already in 1458. His oldest known printed work is a Latin Bible printed with 49 lines per page (""B49""), whose first volume is dated 1460. As Johannes Gutenberg's Bible was printed with 42 lines per page, Mentelin's had fewer pages and proved handier.
 
Johannes Mentelin quickly achieved business success, which made him a prosperous man. In 1466, he was even awarded a coat of arms by Emperor Frederick III. After about 20 years as a book printer, Mentelin died on December 12, 1478 in Strasbourg. He was buried in the cemetery of the (no longer existing) St.-Michael's-Chapel. His grave was later removed and is now inside Strasbourg Cathedral. His two daughters married the book printers, Martin Schott and Adolf Rusch. The latter, also called the printer with the bizarre R, took over the Offizin.
 
About 40 printed works are ascribed to Johannes Mentelin's Strasbourg Offizin. His printing and publishing list contained predominantly theological and philosophical works in Latin, whose purity of text was taken care of by scholarly proofreaders. Among others, works of Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Aristotle, John Chrysostom, Isidore of Seville and Albertus Magnus were issued. However, classical texts of antiquity (such as Virgil's Opera and the Comoediae of Terence) were also published. As the only German book printer, Mentelin printed Medieval court literature, such as Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival and the Jüngerer Titurel of Albrecht von Scharfenberg.
 
However, his first printing of a Bible in vernacular language stands out, the so-called Mentelin Bible, one of the first printed books in the German language. The Mentelin Bible was reprinted in the southern German region a further thirteen times by various printers up until the Luther Bible.

Known also by the title Sententiarum libri tres, this is “the first collection of medieval sentences or systematic body of doctrine and pastoral practice and was inspired by the works of [St.] Augustine and Gregory I” (New Catholic Encyclopedia); here in a later printing. The contents are dogma (book I), moral problems (book II), and pastoral practice and law (book III). Added to this edition are the saint's musings on the misery of the human condition, i.e., his Libellus soliloquiorum de angustia & miseria hominis.

An interesting aspect of the work is that in Book I, Chapter X (De Mundo) is the earliest systematic formulation of the concept of the macrocosm/microcosm.

Surrounding the black-letter type of the title-page is an elaborate single-element woodcut frame incorporating columns, urns, vines, and mythical figures. The text is printed in an interesting roman type with a number of modified gothic capitals. Some initial spaces with guide letters are found in the section of soliloquies.

For if a fine-bound, beautiful book is not read, then the elevation of the mind is of no use at all to the soul (non facit mundam animam). But this book, which is read alike, can lose its external beauty, but it raises and embellishes the soul (pulchram animam).""

'There are many and religious people who like to have a great many books neatly and beautifully bound and keep them shut up in their book-case, so that they themselves do not read them, nor do they lend them to others to read, unaware that it is of no use to possess books and not to read them, because of the hindrances of daily life.  For a neatly bound and covered book, if it is not read, does not purify the soul.'

John of Gaddesden (1280?–1361), was an English physician who wrote this treatise  in 1314 according to Cholmeley.  This is exactly contemporaneous with Mundinus' Anatomia.

John was born about 1280, and wrote in the early part of the fourteenth century. He took his name from Gaddesden on the borders of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire, where an ancient house, opposite that gate of Ashridge Park which is nearest to the church of Little Gaddesden, is shown as his. He was a member of Merton College (Wood), and a doctor of physic of Oxford. He began to study medicine about 1299, and soon attained large practice in London.

 That a *Forraigner compiling a Catalogue of men eminent in that faculty, acknowledgeth him a Writer of high esteem therein. By * one who hath made a List of Learned men, he is styled Johannes Anglicus. I am in∣formed that lately his Books have been printed in Italy in a Folio; No small Honour (I assure you) Seeing in Physick the Italians account all Tramountain Doctors but Apo∣thecaries in comparison of themselves. The first Treatise in his Book is termed *Rosa Anglica, The English Rose, and I doubt not, but as it is Sweet in the Title, so it is Soveraign in the matter therein contained. This John flourished in the year of our Lord 1320.

He treated a son of Edward I, probably Thomas of Brotherton, for smallpox. He was the first Englishman to be appointed physician to the English monarch (Edward II).

Between 1305 and 1307 he wrote a treatise on medicine, which soon became famous, entitled Rosa Medicinæ. He chose the name, he said, because as the rose has five petals, so his book has five parts, and adds that as the rose excels all flowers, so his book excels all treatises on the practice of medicine. The title was probably suggested by Bernard de Gordon's Lilium Medicinæ, which appeared at Montpellier in 1303, and is quoted in the Rosa.

Gaddesden's book is often spoken of as Rosa Anglica. It is filled  with quotations from Galen, Pedanius Dioscorides, Rufus of Ephesus, Hali Abbas, Serapion, Al Rhazes, Avicenna, Averroes, John of Damascus, Isaac, Masawaiyh (Mesuë), Gilbertus Anglicus, and from the Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum, but also contains a good many original remarks which illustrate the character of the author more than his medical knowledge. The book begins with an account of fevers based on Galen's arrangement, then goes through diseases and injuries beginning with the head, and ends with an antidotarium (a treatise on remedies). It contains some remarks on cooking, and innumerable prescriptions, many of which are superstitious, while others prove to be common-sense remedies when carefully considered. He cared for his gains, and boasts of getting a large price from the Barber Surgeons' guild for a prescription of which the chief ingredient is tree frogs (Rosa, ed. Pavia, p. 120). His disposition, his peculiarities, and his reading are so precisely those of the ""Doctour of Phisik"" in Geoffrey Chaucer's prologue that it seems possible that Gaddesden is the contemporary from whom Chaucer drew this character.

Many manuscripts of the Rosa Medicinæ are extant. It was first printed at Pavia in 1492, again at Venice, 1502, and at Pavia, 1517, and for the last time at Augsburg in 1595 (two volumes). It was translated into Irish.

Gaddesden was in priest's orders, and was appointed to the stall of Wildland in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 1 Aug. 1342. He died in 1361.

The best account of his writings is in John Freind's History of Physick, 1726, ii. 277-293. This account contains the error, repeated by John Aikin's Biographical Memoirs of Medicine, 1780, pp. 9-11, that he held the stall of Ealdland. The John de Gatesdone who held this stall was another person, and died before 1262.

The first work is the first printed medical treatise by an English author, an early 14th-century compilation dealing with fevers, various diseases and injuries, and remedies, drawing uncritically on ancient and medieval sources. ""Gaddesden . . . was the first major medical scholar to have been trained wholly in England, and the only Oxford-trained medieval physician to achieve recognition on the continent"" (ODNB). He is thought by some to have been the model for Chaucer's Doctour of Phisik, and both he and Bernardus de Gordonio are among the medical authorities cited in the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales. The second work, excerpted from the author's larger treatise De conservatione vitae humanae dating from the same period, deals with uroscopy and pulse reading as diagnostic tools. 

For epilepsy he recommends the patient to wear the head of a cuckoo around his neck. See Pemell. 1650 who recommended ""applying ‘a female pigeon (the fethers being first pulled off) unto the navell of the epileptick; for hereby the fit is abated, and the venomous vapours are drawn away"".

He also was professor at Montpelier and served as dean and chancellor of the faculty for many years.  He made the French translations of Rondelet.

Latude about 1574 edition: Un des rares livres de chirurgie écrit en français à la Renaissance . Il contient neuf études sur le traitement des blessures d'arquebuses et diverses questions de médecine et de chirurgie. On traitait alors les plaies d'armes à feu en les brûlant à l'aide d'un fer rouge ou d'huile bouillante. Laurent Joubert, tout comme Ambroise Paré, montre l'absurdité de telles pratiques, les balles d'arcquebuse n'étant pas venimeuses comme on le croyait alors. Joubert répond dans cet ouvrage à quantité de questions, telles que : A l'amputation d'un membre, est-il bon de le couper à la jointure, ou vaut-il mieux s'en abstenir ? Ou bien : Est-il possible qu'aucun prenne la pissechaude vérolique par l'accointance d'une femme qui soit bien nette de vérole ? 
Médecin ordinaire d'Henri III et d'Henri IV, chancelier de l'Université de Montpellier, Laurent Joubert a écrit tous ses ouvrages en français, à destinations des chirurgiens qui pour la plupart n'entendaient pas le latin. Pour la Biographie médicale, cet ouvrage ""renferme les préceptes les plus judicieux sur la nature et le traitement des plaies d'armes à feu. Joubert prouve qu'elles ne sont point produites par le venin, ni la brûlure, et conclut que tout se borne à la contusion et à la solution d'unité."" Cette troisième édition est la plus complète. On y trouve pour la première fois plusieurs textes, dont : Une ""apologie de Nicolas Poget contre Joseph Du Chesne touchant le problème, s'il est possible d'envenimer les balles d'arcbouse"" et la ""Question des huiles, s'ils doivent être nécessaires à la curation des plaies, ulcères, tumeurs, douleurs & autres maux externes que traite le chirurgien."" La première édition date de 1574, la troisième a été augmentée de plus de 150 pages.

Édition originale des Annotations. Elles seront ensuite publiées à la suite des éditions ultérieures de Laurent Joubert de La Grande Chirurgie. Cet ouvrage, publié un an après la mort de Joubert, comporte une longue dédicace, les annotations portant sur chacun des sept traités de Guy de Chauliac et l'interprétation des langues. Cette « inter-prétation des langues » est une sorte de glossaire en quatre parties : dictions anatomiques, dictions pathologiques, médicaments, instruments et opérations chirurgicales ; la dernière partie renferme les gravures qui représentent des instruments de chirurgie et qui ont été empruntées pour la plupart à Ambroise Paré. La Grande Chirurgie de Guy de Chauliac a été imprimée originellement en 1478 (Printing and the Mind of Man, 21 ; En Français dans le Texte, 28 ; Garrison & Morton, 5556 et 3666.83). C'était le premier livre médical de cette importance publié en français, écrit avec méthode et clarté, et regroupant toutes les connaissances médico-chirurgicales du XIVe siècle. Guy de Chauliac est considéré comme le plus grand chirurgien du Moyen Age. Laurent Joubert (1529-1583) fut professeur et chancelier de l'université de Montpellier, médecin de Henri III et du roi de Navarre. Pourvu d'une grande érudition et possédant d'indéniables qualités littéraires, Joubert écrivit plusieurs ouvrages, qui font partie des oeuvres médicales les plus importantes de la Renaissance.

","The Institutes has remained a resource for legal scholars over the centuries by presenting a more accessible, rationally ordered, and concise summary of the main concepts of Roman Law than the much larger and more comprehensive Digest; it was cited by the New York Supreme Court in a property law case as recently as 1805 (Online Resources, “The Medieval Law School”).

Justinian I (Flavius Anicius Justinianus), the nephew of Justin I, was proclaimed sole emperor and crowned along with his wife Theodora in 527.  His reign saw notable military successes, extending the territory of the Empire, and reuniting the East and West. But Justinian’s greatest legacy was as a legislator and promoter of the codification of Roman law.  The writings of the jurists were published as the Digesta of 533. The Codex, which compiled all of the extant imperial constitutions from the time of Hadrian, was published in 534. The Code was updated in a later work known as the Novellae in 556. The Institutes, Digest, Code and Novella together comprise what is known as the Corpus Juris Civilis, the Body of Civil Law.

Though largely forgotten for several centuries after the fall of the Western Empire, Roman law experienced a revival that began in Northern Italy in the eleventh century, blossomed at the university of Bologna in the twelfth, and spread throughout Europe. As a text studied at universities, copies of the Institutiones most often include extensive commentaries explaining the text copied in the margins.  Our copy was surely meant to be glossed in this way.  Only f. 31rv now includes an extensive marginal commentary added in the thirteenth century.  There are, however, brief notes in the margins: book 1 on f. 4 (partially trimmed); book 2, ff. 9-15; book 3, ff. 31v-37v; book 4, on ff. 37v-39.  Our text also includes interlinear glosses, noting variant readings (f. 1, “credendis” aliter credendam), expanding abbreviations, and adding brief explanations of words; a passage is marked “vacat” on f. 7.

Along with the Digest, Code and Novels, the Institutes is one of the writings known collectively as the Corpus Juris Civilis. Intended for students, the Institutes is an elementary treatise on Roman private law. Like its companion volumes, its subsequent influence on European jurisprudence is difficult to underestimate. It received a great deal of commentary during the medieval and early modern eras. The first significant commentator was Accorso (Accursius), a professor of law at the University of Bologna and a leading figure in the revival of classical jurisprudence. He examined every extant note and commentary when he prepared his epochal edition of the Institutes, Digest and Code. This massive effort eliminated much of the obscurity and contradiction introduced by earlier writers. His gloss on this edition, which superseded all previous attempts, was often cited as the Glossa Ordinaria or Magistralis. It remained definitive until its 1583 revision by Denis Godefroy. ","Fr.

This is a tall, attractive copy of an introductory textbook of Roman law, part of the ""Corpus Juris Civilis,"" or ""Body of Civil Law"" codified by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the sixth century A.D., and first printed by Gutenberg successor Peter Schoeffer in 1468. Born a barbarian, Justinian I (483-565) became the most famous of all the late Roman emperors, with a reign filled with great events and achievements. Above all else, he is remembered today as a legislator and codifier of the law. He took the Roman law, which he found in a very confused state at the beginning of his rule in 528, and immediately formed the first of a number of commissions and committees, the original fruit of which was the ""Codex,"" promulgated in 529. This was a simplification and clarification of the imperial ordinances passed during the middle and later empires. It was followed by the ""Digest"" of older Roman treatises, the ""Novels,"" setting forth additional constitutions of Justinian and later emperors, and the present ""Institutes,"" a textbook for use in training lawyers which is divided into three parts, discussing laws that relate to persons, property, and actions. The extensive gloss here is the work of 13th century Bolognese lawyer Accursio (ca. 1182-1263), who undertook the enormous task of compiling and arranging the thousands of commentaries on Justinian that had been produced over seven centuries. 

This copy was extensively annotated by a 15th century student or instructor. It also has a distinguished provenance: in the 18th century it was owned by Catdinal Loménie de Brienne at who's sale Michael Wodhull (1740-1816) bought it for £22.5.8.  Woodhul is counted by DNB as one of ""the most knowledgeable of English bibliophiles""; Dibdin described him as ""the present father of bibliography,"" and works from his library typically have, as here, Wodhull's bibliographic notations on the front flyleafi The book later passed into the possession of Michael Tomkinson (1841-1921), who made his fortune in carpet manufacturing before turning his attention to philanthropy, country sports, and collecting rare books and manuscripts. And owner Albert May Todd (1850-1931) was known as the ""Peppermint King"" because he became a wealthy man processing and selling mint extract and other essential oils from offices in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He assembled a first-rate collection of ornithological and other natural history books, handsomely bound classics, early printing, and fine bindings as well as a representative sampling of Western and Oriental illuminated material.

4. Michael Tomkinson Bookplate
Ken Tomkinson (1918-1985) came from a rich heritage of book collectors.

Michael was a major collector of books and Japanese antiquities. When Michael died his set of the four Shakespeare Folios was sold privately, while the remainder of his collection formed two sales at Sotheby's (April and July 1922).
