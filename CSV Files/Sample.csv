"Limoges, Pierre de OFM","Pierre de Limoges, OFM",," ",c1250-1306,,," ",De oculo morali,"A preacher's homiletic guide that uses the nature of eye and vision described in Alhacen's <i>De Aspectibus<i> as a basis for similes of the moral life.

","<i>De Oculo Morali<i> by Peter of Limoges is a Franciscan exemplum book; that is, a preacher's homiletic guide containing an anthology of illustrations and examples for homilies. Written late in the 13th century, this important training manual for preachers was produced in the hope making homilies interesting and relevant by making moral parallels and allegories to the principal aspects of Perspectiva‚Äîthe medieval study encompassing the eye, vision, and optics. Perspectiva originated with De Aspectibus, the Latin translation of Katib al-Manazir by the great Arabic scholar Ab≈´  øAlƒ´ al-·∏§asan ibn al-·∏§asan ibn al-Haytham, known as Alhazen in the Latin West. Much of the natural philosophy of vision in the Katib al-Manazir found its way into the De Oculo Morali, via De Aspectibus, becoming similes for the moral life. The book is important as it reveals what was commonly know from the Latin translation of ibn al-Haytham's Katib al-Manazir, giving one aspect of the depth and extent of its influence. More startling is what it shows a preacher's audience could be expected to be familiar with and grasp and, evidently, how common was a general understanding of vision and the eye.||<i>De Oculo Morali<i> is part of a wider tradition of exempla books and is similar to the <i>Lumen Animae<i> attributed to Berengar of Landora, Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela. The <i>Lumen Animae<i> uses natural history and source including Avicenna, Galen, Hippocrates, Pliny the elder, and Theophrastus of Eresus in the same way that the <i>De Oculo Morali<i> uses Alhazen and the De Aspectibus.||<i>De Oculo Morali<i> was widely copied, circulated, and used for more than two centuries. More than 160 manuscript copies still exist. By way of its popularization in homilies of the new natural philosophy in Perspectiva, it was responsible for the spread of perspectivist ideas to a much wider audience than any of the specialized texts of Peckham, Bacon, or Witelo.||The earliest printings appeared at Augsburg in 1475, 1476, and 1477. An edition of the Latin text, and an Italian translation based on it, appeared at Venice in 1496.
","The <i>De Oculo Morali<i> contains 15 chapters. 1: The anatomy of the eye; relating its seven components to the seven virtues. 2: Alignment of the type of eye component (soft or hard) with aspects of mercy and justice. 3: Enunciates the three types of vision: direct, reflected, refracted. Each with a lessened ability to convey veracity, and related to spiritual vision. 4: Claims that both intromission (species of objects coming into the eye) and extramission (vision rays leaving the eye) are required for sight. This is aligned with the requirement for the requirement of an individual‚Äôs cooperation with God‚Äôs grace. 5: The role of the single nerve behind the eye (after the optic chiasm) as the seat of vision. The brain is presented having an internal sense that acts as vision‚Äôs gatekeeper. 6: Explains 13 optical illusions, with moral and spiritual illusions being paired with physical and optical ones. 7: From the 12 ‚Äònatural properties‚Äô of the eye (such as the fact that it is spherical), Limoges builds a system of moral instruction. 8: Characterizes types of eyes with types of sin. 9: How the eyes incur more debt than other parts of the body. 10: Loss and damage to vision 11: Seven conditions necessary for vision in the instruction of students. 12: From the 12 ‚Äònatural properties‚Äô of the eye, develops instruction for priests. 13: The four appropriate objects of spiritual vision. 14: Beautiful visual experiences interpreted in spiritual terms. 15: Divine sight, the eye and vision of God.||Peter of Limoges is interested in aspects of vision beyond their utility for moral allegory. This is clear from Chapter 1 where he gives a description of the eye, together with a brief account of eye diseases and their treatment, as well as Chapter 3 devoted to vision. It is also apparent in the chapter on optical illusions where what was understood about refraction at the time is considered in detail. In general, though, the <i>De Oculo Morali<i> extracts and uses only the qualitative and descriptive aspects of Alhazen's <i>De Aspectibus<i>. Not surprisingly, none of its elaborate mathematics or optical experiments appears in the <i>De Oculo Morali<i>.","‚ÅÇùëª  <i>Peter of Limoges The Moral Treatise on the Eye<i>|Newhauser, R.G., translator|Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 2012||Optics for preachers: The De oculo morali of Peter of Limoges|Clark, D.

The later is particularly the case regarding the senses, including vision. Alexander's commentaries were  vastly influential, affecting later philosophers beginning in late antiquity through late medieval times, including and especially Plotinus and his theory of vision as well as several Arabic scholars. The Scholastic teaching on vision formed by Alexander's commentary on Aristotle's De Anima, was in continual opposition to Perspectiva after it arose, first appeared in print in the present edition, and finally ended with the publication of Fortunio Liceti's <i>De Luminis Natura<i> of 1640.||Girolamo Donato produced this, the first Latin translation of De Anima in 1495. Angelo Canini produced another Latin translation in 1546. As Donato points out in his Preface, Alexander's Greek text had long been influential and earned him the name 'The Commentator.' Donato's Latin made Alexander's assessment of and extension to Aristotle's teaching on the senses and the intellect available to a wide late medieval and early Renaissance readership.
","Alexander of Aphrodisias describes and advances Aristotle's theory of light and vision which, as stated by  Alexander, has its basis in the proposition that 'The proper sensible object of sight is colors.' Media between the eye and an object of color has the potential to be transparent. The eye gains access to colors when the intervening medium has that potentiality actualized. That is, the medium's potential transparency is made actual. The medium must be illuminated by light for this to take place. Alexander considers that colors and light set potentially transparent media in motion, bringing about the actualization of transparency, and as a result, color moves and tinctures light itself. He cites the example of a wall taking on the color of an opposing wall that is deeply pigmented. Alexander explicitly denies an 'efflux' or emission of any type; motion is transferred but there is nothing emitted. In this Alexander explicitly opposed the theory of the Atomists, who consider vision to take place when 'eidola' (spirit-images, idols)  were emitted by an object and entered the eye.||Alexander set out the full process of vision this way: A transparent substance is illuminated and becomes actually transparent and is acted upon by color, setting the transparent substance in motion which, in turn, acts upon the sense of sight. Light, therefore, takes on color from different visible objects, and is directed by these objects in a straight line to the organ of vision and transmits to the eye the very same affection which it received from the colored objects. Importantly 'Light' for Alexander (and for Aristotle) is not an emitted substance, rather it is 'the activity of what is transparent.' Stated in terms of Aristotle's four causes, light is the efficient cause, color the formal cause, the medium the material cause, and vision the final cause. The idea that color-motion moves in straight lines from object to eye is the first application of geometrical optics to Aristotelian vision theory and would later prompt medieval extensions involving vision by reflection and refraction. Additionally, Alexander's extension of the idea of color-motion allows him to account for other aspects of visual perception including motion, position, and shape by making a distinction between color appearance and perception.","‚ÅÇ <i>Alexander of Aphrodisias and his Doctrine of the Soul: 1400 Years of Lasting Significance<i>|Ke√üler, E.|Brill, Leiden, 2011, 101 pp, NB: pp 24-42.||<i>The History of Vision, Colour, & Light Theories<i>|Zempl√©n, G. √Å.|Bern <i>Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science<i>, 2005||‚ÅÇùëª Fotinis, A.F.|<i>The De Anima of Alexander of Aphrodisias: A Translation and Commentary<i>|Thesis, Marquette University, 1978.||Alexander of Aphrodisias on Vision in the Atomists|Avotins, I.|<i>The Classical Quarterly<i>, New Series, Vol 30, No 2, 1980, pp 429-454.||The Prefaces to the Greek Editions and Latin Translations of Alexander of Aphrodisias, 1450 to 1575|Cranz, F.E.|<i>Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society<i>, Vol 102, No 5, 1958, pp 510-546.",****,Alexandri aphrodisi enarratio de anima ex aristotelis institutione.

Euclid,Euclid,Euclid of Alexandria,Also Known As: Euclid of Alexandria,c295 BC,,," ",Elementorum Geometricorum Lib XV,"First appearance of all of Euclid's geometrical optics.","The first complete assemblage of the Euclidean texts, with printings of both Campanus of Navara's and Bartolomeo Zamberti's versions of the Elements. This edition begins with a Preface by Philipp Melanchthon, which censorship had often removed. The Campanus of Navara version of Books I-XV of the Elements was common in the late Middle Ages and Ratdolt used it in his editio princeps of 1482. In addition is the version of Bartolomeo Zamberti which he had based on a Greek text and so, he claimed, rendered a more accurate and faithful Euclid. Latin translations of Euclid's Optica and Catoptrica were first printed in Georgius Valla's massive compendium <i>De Expetendis et Fugiendis Rebus Opus<i> printed by Aldus at Venice in 1501, but this is the first edition of Euclid's collected works to contain them both. The <i>Optica<i> is a Latin translation of the first Greek work on vision and perspective--the earliest surviving text on optics and light in the western world. The <i>Optica<i> presents the phenomena of visible light and the Euclidian idea of vision rays emanating from the eye, comfortably aligned with and analyzed by geometry. It re-emerged as an important text in the 15h century for it use in the theory of linear perspective. The <i>Catoptrica<i>, a treatise on mirrors attributed by Proclus to Euclid, covers the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed by plane and spherical concave mirrors.
","This edition contains the Elements, Phaenomena, Optica, Catoptrica, Data, and the Opusculum de Levi & Ponderoso. The last work is of questionable authorship but Arabic sources attest to a Euclidian work on moving bodies. The Optica begins with 7 postulates which together detail the nature of the visual cone, with its apex at the center of the eye, its circular base out at the limit of vision, and its interior filled with straight rays, spaced equally within. vision takes place when rays fall on an object. From this basis, the subsequent 58 propositions define vision and aspects of visual perception including apparent size, acuity, motion, shape, judgements of distance--all based on the visual angle subtended by the viewed object. Each proposition is based on or proved with geometry. Some of the propositions arise from geometric astronomy, some deal with the practical matters of surveying and mensuration. All this can be considered a geometricization of the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by rays that emanate from the eye.||The Catoptrica begins with six postulates that establish vision as the result of straight vision rays, even when their course is altered by reflection. They also set down the equal-angle law of specular reflection, and the so-called cathetus rule regarding reflected object position and visibility in plane and spherical mirrors. The cathetus being the line passing through the object and perpendicular to the reflecting surface. The rule was held to be universally true until the end of 16th century. Thirty six propositions follow the postulates, established images positions in mirrors of various forms. The latter propositions establish image position using the cathetus rule, attempting to explain image anomalies (size, magnification, position) in curved mirrors. Like the Optica, the Catoptrica is entirely geometric; there is nothing physical or physiological in the material, aside from the fundamental assumption of rectilinear vision rays emitted from the eye, the propagation, direction, and interaction of which can be described entirely by geometry.","ùëª The Optics of Euclid|Burton, H.E., translator|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i>, Vol 46, No 5, 1945, pp 357-372.||ùëª <i>The medieval Latin traditions of Euclid's Catoptrica: A Critical Edition of De speculis with an Introduction, English Translation, and Commentary<i>|Takahashi, K.|Kyushu University Press, 1992, 373 pp.||<i>Campanus of Novara and Euclid's Elements<i>|Busard, H.L.L.|Franz Steiner Verlag, 2005, 535 pp, NB pp 1-46.||<i>From Sight to Light<i>|Smith, A.M.|University of Chicago Press, 2015, 457 pp, NB: pp 47-64.||Pseudo-Euclidean reflections in ancient optics: a re-examination of textual issues pertaining to the the Euclidean Optica and Catoptrica|Knorr, W.|<i>Physis<i>, Vol 31, No 1, 1994, pp 1-45.||Peripatetic and Euclidean theories of the visual ray|Jones, A.|<i>Physis<i>, Vol 31, No 1, 1994, pp 47-76.",****,Euclid Elementorum Geometricorum Lib XV,The Fifteen Books of Euclid's Elements of Geometry,1537,1525-1550,"Ancient author of geometry, taught at Athens and Alexandria.","BioSketch: c295 BC  Ancient author of geometry, taught at Athens and Alexandria.",9,1482,Late edition (First in 1482),,Basel,Johann Herwagen,Printed at Basel by Johann Herwagen,47.5649,7.6153,,,,,c 1/2 calf over speckled boards rebacked,Contemporary 1/2 Calf Over Speckled Boards Rebacked,Royal 4·¥º,2,"2¬∞ ",195,295,Format and Size:  2¬∞  295 x 195 mm,Royal 4·¥º 295x195 mm,295 x 195 mm,‚Ä†‚Å¥ a-z‚Å∂ A-Z‚Å∂ Aa-Cc‚Å∂," [ùü†] 1-587 [ùüô]",,"Marginalia , calculations, and notes throughout",,,,Collation: ‚Ä†‚Å¥ a-z‚Å∂ A-Z‚Å∂ Aa-Cc‚Å∂|Pagination: [ùü†] 1-587 [ùüô],https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bibliothecaopticoriaimages/1537 Euclid - Elementorum Geometricorum Lib XV - Images.JPG,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1537 Euclid - Elementorum Geometricorum Lib XV - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bibliothecaopticoriaimages/1537 Euclid - Elementorum Geometricorum Lib XV - Images.JPG|https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bibliothecaopticoriadescriptions/1537 Euclid - Elementorum Geometricorum Lib XV|http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10164527_00005.html,http://books.google.com/books/about/Euclidis_Megarensis_mathematici_clarissi.html?id=caGBGN29IIQC,17,,,,1/14/2016,EU 3700,"$4,100",Purchased From Binoche et Giquello,Binoche et Giquello,"$12,500","$12,500",Libreria Pregliasco,7/27/2021,"$4,100",Binoche et Giquello,12/9/2015,Elementorum Geometricorum Lib Xv,1537,Euclid 1537,2220.00,Johann Herwagen,"Herwagen, Johann ",2940.00,,4.00,2
"Fine, Oronce",Oronce Fine,," ",1494-1555,,," ",De Speculo Ustorio,"Textbook on mathematical optics and parabolic burning mirrors, with mathematical analyses and methods of construction. Part of Fine's effort to revive mathematics at the University of Paris.","Oronce Fine set out to revive mathematics in Renaissance France, specifically in the curriculum at the Coll√®ge de France. <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i> and other books were his effort to provide the necessary awareness of mathematic and provide students textbooks. This is the origin of and intention for his textbook on mathematical optics and parabolic burring mirrors, which included mathematical analyses and methods of construction. As Fine stats in the preface, his most important optical source for <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i> was Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i>. Though Fine likely had access to the <i>Perspectiva's<i> printing in 1535, it is known that he worked from a manuscript copy before the 1535 printing. His other optical source was an edited version of Alhazen‚Äôs <i>De Speculis Comburentibus<i> which had been printed in 1548. Fine's parabolic geometry comes from Georgius Valla‚Äôs <i>De Expetendis et Fugiendis Rebus Opus<i> of 1501 and from Johann Werner‚Äôs Libellus of 1522. Though not of original material, the <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i> was a carefully crafted  compilation of sections of select texts, comprising a much-need textbook on catoptrics. It was the first such book printed in France and like his other books was widely popular, esteemed for its careful presentation, straightforward Latin, and the excellence of its figures. <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i>, along with several other of his books, became widely used throughout Europe at universities in need of up-to-date textbooks. In this, Fine took advantage not only of his knowledge of optics and geometry, but also of the need and ability of students.||An Italian translation of <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i> appeared in 1587 as an appendix to a translation of another of Fine‚Äôs books, <i>Protomathesis<i>. Fine's Propositions 8 and 9 were repeated nearly verbatim in Giovanni Battista Della Porta's <i>Magiae Naturalis<i> of 1558.
","Fine's textbook has the intention of exercising mathematical analysis in catoptrics, of showing the superior nature of paraboloids as burring mirrors, and to show practical methods to make such mirrors. First, there are 12 definitions involving conic sections, then four postulates involving the laws of reflection. There follow propositions, proved using Euclid's Elements, culminating in Proposition 7, showing that incoming rays parallel to the axis of the parabola are all reflected to the same point, the focus. Proposition 8 shows a way to draw a parabola and Proposition 9 demonstrates a way to construct a parabolic burning mirror using the method in Proposition 8. Proposition 10 involves the hyperbolic conic section, though it is not named as such. ","‚ÅÇ Oronce Fine's De Speculo Ustorio|Ross, R.

"Lucretius Carus, Titus",Titus Lucretius Carus,," ",94-c50 BC,Hubert van Giffen,,Edited by Hubert van Giffen,De Rerum Natura,"Hubert van Giffen's edited text of 'On the Nature of Things' by Titus Lucretius Carus, presenting Epicurean natural philosophy.","Plantin's first printing of the text edited by the Dutch humanist Hubert van Giffen, professor of law in Strasbourg, Altdorf and Ingolstadt and advisor to Emperor Rudolf II. As with most copies, though printed in 1565, this copy 's title page  bears the date 1566; printed for purposes of marketing it at the Frankfurt book fair that year. In addition to the Lucretian poem, this edition also contains the original Greek text of Epicurus' Letter to Herodotus, in which he expresses his theories on Physics and Meteorics, various passages on Epicurus taken from the works of Cicero, and an extract from the Greek text of Thucydides on the plague of Athens. van Giffen dedicated the work to Johannes Sambucus (that is, J√°nos Zs√°mboky) Hungarian humanist, physician, philologist and historian. Zs√°mboky is the source for the editions' marginal philological notes and the very extensive final index.||Early printings of  <i>De Rerum Natura<i> vary widely in accuracy, detail, and emphasis--its manuscript tradition being uncertain. The oldest two manuscripts are of 9th century Carolingian origin. Another tradition is formed by Italian manuscripts all originating from Poggio Bracciolini's discovery in 1417 of a manuscript of Lucretius‚Äôs <i>De natura rerum<i> in  the library of a Swiss monastery. Thus, when printed edition began to appear, the result depended heavily on the editor, his available sources, the manuscript tradition he adhered to, and his background. There are 54 Renaissance manuscripts extant.||The editio princeps appeared at Brescia around 1473 and, like the editions that appeared in 1486 Verona and in 1495 at Venice, was filled with errors. A corrected Aldine quarto edited by Hieronymus Avancius appeared at Venice in 1500. The last Aldine edition appeared in 1515, printing a text edited by Andrea Navagero. It's text dominated printed editions for 50 years. The Parisian Aristotelian Denys Lambin (1520‚Äì1572) published a corrected text accompanied by a massive 300,000-word commentary In 1563. Though scholarly important, Lambin's work was impractically large and expensive. Its rival became this edition produced by van Giffen, which was better suited for general and student use. Both were used until the 18th century. In all, 30 editions were printed before 1600. Translations appear in French in 1650, in English in 1656 and 1680, in Italian in 1669, in Dutch in 1701, and German in 1784.","Lucretius adhered to the philosophy of Epicurus, who, writing 200 years before, advanced an atomism as the foundation of the natural world and, of a consequence, held that the gods cannot and do not influence the affairs of men. In its nearly 7500 lines, Lucretius's didactic poem has as its object the freeing of man from ignorance and the thralldom of religion and to provide guidance for a better lived life. It has six books. Book 1: The nature of atoms and the void; Rook 2: The properties and combinations of atoms in the diverse phenomena of the world; Book 3: The nature of the soul and its mortality; Book 4: The nature of our perception of the physical world, dreams, illusions and sex; Book 5: The history of the world and the development of mankind and a range of celestial and terrestrial phenomena; Book 6: A description of the great plague of Athens of 430 BC.||Book 4 begins with a long explanation of the physical nature of perception, including the idea of vision based on the ocular reception of simulacra emitted by viewed objects, and a list of and reasons for optical illusions. Though the senses, including vision, are presented as limited, Lucretius holds they are reliable enough to be the basis for behavioral choice.","Some problems in Lucretius‚Äô account of vision'|Sharples, R.W.|Leeds International Classical Studies, Vol 1, No 2, 2002, pp 1-11.||Titi Lucreti Cari De Rerum Natura Libri Sex|Bailey, C.|3 vols, Oxford, Oxford University Press, , 1947.||Lucretius: ‚ÄòDe Rerum Natura‚Äô IV, Godwin, J.|Aris & Phillips Classical Texts, 1986, pp 182.||A bibliography of Lucretius|Gordon, C.A.|St. Paul‚Äôs Bibliographies,Winchester, 1985, 323 pp.

","Egnatio Danti worked on his translations of the optics works of Euclid and Heliodorus at the end of his time in Florence.

"Mirami, Rafael",Rafael Mirami,," ",?-?,,," ",Compendiosa Introduttione alla prima parte della specularia,"An elementary consideration of the utility and properties of mirrors; fundamentally geometric  but larded with verse from Dante, Petrarch, Horace to support arguments.","Rafael Mirami's <i>Compendiosa<i> is a late Renaissance consideration of the utility and properties of mirrors. It is the product of the transition from the catoptrical optics of antiquity and its attempt to produce images from distant objects, to the development of dioptrical optics in the early 17th century that led to the telescope. Interestingly, and suggestive of late Renaissance humanism, Mirami's fundamentally geometric text is larded with verse from Dante, Petrarch, Horace to support his arguments. Glass developments in Venice early in 16th century made mirrors widely available and Mirami's work was written in hopes of elevating the intellectual study of mirrors, considering not only their manufacture, but also practical, astronomical, theoretical, and moral aspects; deemphasizing, if not ignoring, their use to amplify vanity or to produce visual tricks and 'lascivious use.' Mirami includes an elaborate Tavola that gives a schema of types of mirrors, their properties, their uses, and the types and place of images they produce.
","The <i>Compendiosa<i> has 25 chapters, each elaborating a different aspect of the phenomenon of reflection. Mirami begins by enumerating the fields of application of mirrors, among which astrology and philosophy; avoiding the usual parade of games and entertainments. In addition to its practical applications, Mirami deals with techniques of mirror making, problem related to images produced by mirrors, how images can be illusional or misleading. Columnar and pyramidal mirrors are considered, as well as how mirrors can multiply images. In the second part of the work, Mirami describes the application of mirrors for the construction of interior solar clocks by bringing the moving image of the sun to an interior space via mirrors. This work anticipated that of Athanasius Kircher and Emmanuel Maignan on catoptric meridians.","Corrispondenze ottico-prospettiche tra le opere di Maignan e di Borromini a palazzo Spada|C√†ndito, C.|<i>M√©langes de l'Ecole fran√ßaise de Rome<i>, Vol 117, No 1, 2005, pp 73-89.||http://www.nicolaseverino.it/Articoli/La meridiana a riflessione fu inventata da Raffaele Mirami.pdf||<i>Galileo's Glassworks: The Telecsope and the Mirror<i>|Eileen Reeves|Harvard University Press, 2008, 240 p.",****,"Compendiosa Introduttione alla prima parte della specularia, Ci√≤ e dell scienze de gli specchi.

"Porta, Giambattista della",Giambattista della Porta,Giovanni Battista Della Porta,Also Known As: Giovanni Battista Della Porta,c1535-1615,,," ",De refractione,"An analysis of refraction in spheres and its application to concave and convex lenses. Important advances in the use of geometric diagrams in optics. Also considers various theories of vision.
","Giambattista Della Porta's <i>De Refractione<i> has its beginnings in his earlier work, the second edition of the Magia Naturalis of 1589. An early version of the <i>De Refractione<i> must already have been underway, if not completed, since he mentions it several times in the Magia Naturalis. In the nearly 30 years that separated the first and second editions of the Magia, Della Porta's understanding of optics and his knowledge of existing works on the subject had grown; he cites earlier works liberally in <i>De Refractione<i>, mentioning Aristotle, Euclid, Galen, Ptolemy, Alhazen, Avicenna, Averroes, Bacon, Witelo, Peckham, and many others. And his manner of presentation changed considerably. The optical part of the Magia was a collection of descriptions of optical effects with only faint attempts at explanation, the <i>De Refractione<i> was based on geometry, with definitions, postulates, theorems, and proofs. His preface makes clear why he (re)wrote <i>De Refractione<i>:  'The circumstance which impelled us to write <i>De Refractione<i> was that we might see the matter covered briefly by our ancestors and become a more  satisfying treatise, so that rather than traces, the foundations of the art could be seen.'|<i>De Refractione<i> is important as a bridge between medieval Perspectiva and the imagining by dioptrics established by Johannes Kepler in 1604. As a prelude to his analysis of refraction in spheres, Della Porta undertakes an extensive analysis of spherical mirrors and this is perhaps the most important advance in <i>De Refractione<i>. It is also witness to the change in optics in the 16th century: a new interest in and insistence upon the use of experiments and observation of nature, and the need and value of constructing geometric models of natural phenomena. Though Della Porta reports many observations, ultimately, he was unable to construct a sufficiently encompassing geometric framework that would have led to a successful treatment of lenses. But even with that, De Refractione had considerable influence, if only because of its introduction of the camera obscura as a model for the eye and the acknowledged starting point this provide for Johannes Kepler.
","<i>De Refractione<i> is in nine books. 1: Refraction of light and vision at the interface of two media. 2: Refraction in the glass sphere. 3: Structure of the eye. 4: Vision as penetration of direct and refracted rays into the eye. 5: Perspective vision. 6: binocular vision. 7: Various issues from the optics, physiology and psychology of vision. 8: Spherical lenses. 9: Various issues on refraction including the rainbow, meteorological phenomena and so on.||De Refractione can be divided into three parts: books 1-2 develop a theory of refraction in spheres (64 pages), books 3-7 analyze the eye and a theory of vision (93 pages), books 8-9 give a  theory of lenses and their application (72 pages).||The work begins with a review of optical basics in the form of propositions and a description of Della Porta's instrument for measuring angles of refraction. His tables of values reveal that he must have actually built and used this device. The basic propositions are used to explain well-known phenomena, some explanations are successful (objects appearing bent when partially submerged in water, atmospheric refraction changing stellar positions), some are not (the position of fully submerged objects).  Before considering spherical refraction, Della Porta considers reflection in concave spherical mirrors and the images it produces; desiring to produce principles valid for refraction and spherical surfaces. The analysis of spherical mirrors is the most successful part of <i>De Refractione<i> and introduced the notion of the 'inversion point' (where reflected/refracted rays cross) as a method of image analysis. The porting of principles of spherical reflection to spherical refraction was erroneous and blinkered most of the later developments in De Refractione. Spherical refraction is applied to the analysis of the eye and the mechanism of vision, combining refraction with traditional ideas involving the visual pyramid and it composite rays and the crystalline humor as the seat of vision. It is here that Della Porta makes his observation that the pupil acts like the aperture in a camera obscura, creating an image that falls on the front surface of the crystalline. Della Porta's consideration of vision includes his somewhat confused theory of vision, including binocular vision. The last part of De Refractione attempts to apply the theory of the refractive sphere and the inversion point to convex and concave lenses and, unhappily, exhibits many instances of an ingenious carelessness on Della Porta's part, with even simple cases of refraction wrongly constructed. Geometry was used more as analogy than a demonstrative tool.

"Clavius, Christopher SJ","Christopher Clavius, SJ",Chrisoph Clau,Also Known As: Chrisoph Clau,1538-1612,,," ",Sph√¶ram,"10th edition of Clavius's commentaries on Sacrobosco's <i>De Sphaera Mundi<i>. Written for use in the Collegio Romano and thus entirely Ptolemaic and strictly anti-Copernican. 
","10th edition of Clavius's commentaries on Sacrobosco's <i>De Sphaera Numdi<i>.  This, the principal astronomical work of Clavius, was his commentary on the <i>Tractatus de sphaera<i>  written by the Englishman Johannes Sacrobosco (John Holywood),  professor in Paris in the thirteenth century. Sacrobosco  presented a simplified version of the second century Alexandrian astronomy of Ptolemy which gained wide popularity, attracted numerious commentators and glosses, and became the most-used astronomy textbook throughout the Middle Ages.||First published in 1570, this is the penultimate edition of Clavius's commentary on Sacrobosco and the last to appear before Galileo's <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> in 1610. The differences between this edition and the next are small but striking. Clavius would edit the work once more, just after the <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> appeared, and in it felt compelled to express some flexibility about the rigid adherence to Ptolemy and Aristotle. in the last edition of 1611, Clavius mentions discoveries such as those of the novae stars seen in 1570, 1600 and 1604 and also the comet of 1577 among others by Tycho Brahe; all indicating that, contrary to the Aristotelian doctrine, the celestial spheres were not incorruptible. Clavius acknowledges that Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus and the satellites of Jupiter showed that not everything was in orbit around the Earth and that the celestial orbits needed to be 'reformed'. ","Clavius sets out his view of then-contemporary astronomy, with his commentaries being far more extensive than the original text of Sacrobosco. Clavius presents a geocentric Ptolemaic astronomy, with the physically-real celestial spheres: seven for the five planets, the Sun and the Moon, one for the fixed stars,  three more to explain certain motions of the stars, and finally the sphere of the empyrean heaven. All with with Ptolemaic eccentrics and epicycles, centered on the Earth at the center of the universe. All allowing an accord with both the physics of Aristotle and a literal interpretation of the Bible.||In the edition of 1581 and repeated here, Clavius pays acknowledges the astronomical work of Copernicus, whom he calls 'the outstanding renovator of astronomy in our times whom posterity will celebrate and admire like a second Ptolemy.'  Nevertheless, though he recognized the great value of Copernicus as a source of observations, tables and calculations, he considered the theory of Ptolemy preferable to what he called the 'inventions' of Copernicus. Writing that many observations and the common opinion of philosophers disprove the heliocentric system, presents many observations and phenomena which prove that the Earth is at the center of the universe; the most important arguments were from Aristotelian physics.","Doctrine of the Sphere, In: <i>The Sun in the Church<i>|Heilbron J.L.|Harvard Universtiy Press, Cambridge, 1999 pp 51-62||The Tracts on the Sphere, In: <i>The Structures of Practical Knowledge<i>|Valleriani, M.|Springer, 2017, PP 421-474||Clavius and Mathematics in the <i>Collegio Romano<i>|Ud√≠as, A.|In: Jesuit Contribution to Science, Springer, 2015, pp 1-22.",****,In sphaeram Joannis de Sacro Bosco commentarius,Commentary on 'The Sphere' of John of Holywood.,1601,1600-1625,"German Jesuit teacher at the Collegio Romano, author of important texts in mathematics and astronomy.","BioSketch: 1538-1612  German Jesuit teacher at the Collegio Romano, author of important texts in mathematics and astronomy.",10,1570,Late edition (First in 1570),,Venice,Giovanni Battista Ciotti,Printed at Venice by Giovanni Battista Ciotti,45.4372,12.3346,,Latin,,,c vellum,Contemporary Vellum,Medium 8·¥º,4,"4¬∞ ",150,210,Format and Size:  4¬∞  210 x 150 mm,Medium 8·¥º 210x150 mm,210 x 150 mm,œÄ¬π a-b‚Å∏ (a‚ÇÇ signed as a‚ÇÉ) A-Z‚Å∏ Aa-Ff‚Å∏ Gg¬π‚Å∞,[ùüõùüö] 1-483 [ùüô],,Engraved portrait of Clavius on verso of front pastedown,"Owner's signature on title page.

Willebrord Snell famously annotated a copy.","Posthumous publication of a compendium of optics by Pierre de la Ram√©e and Friedrich Risner. Risner's library contained an unfinished manuscript of a book he and Pierre de la Ram√©e had begun previous to the publication of Risner's <i>Opticae Thesaurus<i> of 1572. The <i>Opticae Libri Quatuor<i> has a preface to the reader undoubtedly written by the editor and publisher, Nikolaus Krug, a teacher, mathematician, librarian, and school rector at Kassel. Krug notes that the text was the work of both Ramus and Risner: '... a common work, first begun and arranged by the promise and desire of the great Peter Ramus; Risner finished and corrected some parts, and only moved and formed others.' Ramus mentions the unfinished text in his will that funded a Professor of Mathematics at the Coll√®ge Royal. He nominated Risner for the position 'so that he will be able to finish the work on optics which we began by our common labors ...' Risner never finished the project and of the manuscript that Krug brought to the press, only the first book was in a complete state. Apparently, Risner contribution was limited to a few mathematical demonstrations and references to Alhacen and Witelo. Krug included a reprinting of Jean Pena's <i>De Usu Optices<i>, 'The Use of Optics.' as a preface to the four books of Ramus and Risner.||The <i>Opticae Libri Quatuor<i> summarizes the optics of Euclid and Aristotle, but particularly of Alhacen, and Witelo. It is the optics of the <i>Opticae Thesaurus<i> of 1572 with the details summarized or omitted and the mathematical demonstrations much reduced. It was, however abbreviated or incomplete, a useful summary of pre-Keplerian optics. Willebrord Snell considered it so and famously annotated a copy in the years 1611-1622.||Editions appeared in 1606 and 1615.
","The work contains the introduction 'De Usu Optices' from Jean Pena's <i>Euclidis Optica et Catoptrica<i> of 1557, and four books written by Ramus and emended by Risner. Book 1: On the Visible. Book 2: On Direct Vision. Book 3: On Vision Established by Reflection. Book 4: On Refracted Vision. Book 1 presents a medieval perspectivist account of light, color, and vision, mixed with Euclidian rays propagating in straight lines. Vision is the intromission of light and color species emitted by the visible object, made possible by the transparency of intervening medium which, in turn, is affected by light. Witelo's theory of images from pin-holes is given, along with a Euclidian account of light and shadow, and the Scholastic account of color as the mixing of light and dark, white and black. Book 2 is on direct vision and the intromission of species, including the cone of vision and various aspects of visual perception. These include color, size, shape, place, number, and motion. Book 3 is on reflection vision and covers basic reflection, true and false reflection (true images and illusions), plane and curved mirrors, convex and concave mirrors. Book 4 is on refracted vision and covers images from refraction, measurement of refraction, the rainbow, atmospheric refraction and meteorics. Book 1 is the longest and most complete, by far. The material is descriptive, with very little mathematics. Though there are extensive references to the <i>Opticae Thesaurus<i> of 1572, none of the elaborate material on the formation, placement, or size of images from mirrors is present.","Kepler‚Äôs optics without hypotheses|Dupr√©, S.|<i>Synthese<i>, Vol 185, 2012, pp 501‚Äì525.||Atmospheric Refraction and the Ramus Circle: Aspects of a Late Sixteenth-Century Dispute|Peoux, G.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 67, No4 , 2010, pp 457-484||Snellius' Notes on the Reflection and Refraction of Rays|Vollgraff, J.

Contains the earliest explanation of the operation of the pin-hole camera.","Francesco Maurolyco finished his <i>Photismi de Lumine et Umbra<i> in October of 1521 and the first two books of his <i>Diaphaneon<i> in January of 1522.  In 1554 he added a third book on vision to the <i>Diaphaneon<i> and by the end of 1567 had completed the entire work. Though these manuscripts circulated in a limited way for 50 years after they were written, they became widely known after the Jesuit Christopher Clavus from the Collegium Romano visited Maurolyco at Messina in 1574. Clavius was entrusted with the manuscripts of these and other works, in the hope of their being printed at Rome. Optics had gradually become more important at the Collegium Romanum by the end of the 16th century. Though Clavius would edit the <i>Photismi<i> and the <i>Diaphaneon<i>, the midwife of the Naples printing of 1611 was the Naples Jesuit Giovanni Giacomo Staserio. It was Staserio who convinced Clavius of the value and need for Maurolyco's optics work and it was Staserio who found a nobleman in Genoa to pay for the printing--Giovanni Battista Airolo, the dedicatee. The book appeared not long after Kepler's Ad Vitellionem of 1604 and Galileo's <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> of 1609 when optics assumed a critical part of natural philosophy throughout Europe.|Maurolyco fashioned his texts after the Euclidian model: a Spartan march of propositions, proofs, and demonstrations. They present the earliest explanation of the operation of the pin-hole camera, a theory of vision, a consideration of spectacles for correcting vision, and an explanation of the rainbow--albeit faulty. Maurolyco was the greatest mathematician to work in optics between Ibn al-Haytham in 950 and Johannes Kepler in 1604. He was the first to systematically consider illumination, dealt successfully with penumbral shadow, solved the problem of radiation through small apertures and images from pin-holes, attacked the problem of the rainbow, was the first to explore the geometry of radiation through thin lenses and so gained an understanding of visual theory that pointed to the cause and cure of near and far-sightedness. His extensive work in mathematics allowed him to bring a sophistication to optics beyond that of medieval times and bring a Euclidian clarity of structure to its presentation and demonstration. The <i>Photismi<i>||Editions appeared at Naples in 1611 and, with a slightly changed title, at Lyon in 1613. 
"," Francesco Maurolyco's <i>Photismi de Lumine et Umbra<i> has three topics: Illumination, pin-hole images, and reflections in curved mirrors. The work begins with four definitions and 6 postulates. From these foundations on the rectilinear propagation of light, Maurolyco develops 35 theorems. Theorems 1-21 deal with illumination, shadows, and penumbral shadows. Theorems 22-24 deal with images from small apertures. Theorems 25-35 deal with reflection and curved mirrors. Though theorems 1-21 are geometrically analytic, they are not quantitative so it would be inaccurate to describe them as dealing with photometry. However, they do consider the basic aspects of illumination and the projection of shadows in a qualitative way. Images from small apertures is analyzed using facing pyramids, bases formed by object and image and each apex coincident at point over the aperture. With an analysis of the angles involved, Maurolyco explains how the shape of the image changes with the distance from the aperture. The material on mirrors is entirely traditional, covering convex and concave mirrors, image inversion and burning mirrors.||The <i>Diaphaneon<i> is in three books. Book 1: On refraction. Book 2: On the Rainbow. Book 3: On the Eye and Vision. Book 1 begins with four postulates and presents 24 theorems on refraction and refracted images. This includes images displaced by refraction a plane interfaces, an approximate law of refraction, and ray paths in glass spheres. Book 2 is an unsuccessful attempt to analyze the rainbow based on reflection with a single raindrop. Book 3 is on the structure of the eye and the use of lenses to correct vision. The ocular anatomy is from Vesalius and the rest is traditional perspectivist vision with the crystalline humor as the seat of vision. In this context, Maurolyco investigates the convergence and divergence of rays in concave and convex lenses and, appealing to the requirement for ray symmetry on either side of the crystalline (with its assumed symmetrical lenticular shape), assumes that divergent light entering the crystalline, produced symmetric convergence exiting the crystalline and onto the optic nerve. He then reasoned that if the crystalline were wrongly shaped far or near-sightedness could occur, which could be correct by spectacles.||The commentary and editing by Clavius is particularly important in the Photismi, with evidence of changes and cancels made during the press run. In his letter to the reader, the printer makes clear that Clavius' additions, comments, and corrections have been set in italics.","‚ÅÇ Optics in Sixteenth-century Italy|Lindberg, D.|In: <i>Proceedings; Novita Celesti e Crisi del Sapere, Atti del Convegno Inernzionale de Studi Galileiani<i>, Istituto e Museo de Storia della Scienze, Florence, 1983, pp 131-148.||Francesco Maurolico, Giambattista della Porta and Their Theories on Refraction|Bell√©, Riccardo|In: <i>The Optics of Giambattista della Porta(ca. 1535‚Äì1615): A Reassessment<i>|Borrelli, A., Hon, G., Zik, Y., editors|Springer, 2017, 205 pp, NB: pp 172-184.||I Gesuiti e la pubblicazione dell'ottica di Francesco Maurolico|Bell√®, R.|<i>Bollettino di storia delle scienze matematiche<i>, Vol 26, 2006, pp 211-243||Geometry of Light and Shadow: Francesco Maurolyco (1494-1575) and the Pinhole Camera|Hon, G. and Zik, Y.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 64, No 4, 2007, pp 549-578.||Ptolomey, Alhazen, and Kepler and the Problem of Optical Images|Smith, A.M.|<i>Arabic Sciences and Philosophy<i>, Vol. 8, 1998, pp 9-44.||ùëª<i>The Photismi de lumine of Maurolycus : A Chapter in Late Medieval Optics<i>|Crew, H. translator|MacMillian, New York, 1940.||Bibliographic Analysis: <i>Edizione Nazionale dell'Opera matematica di Francesco Maurolico<i>|http://maurolico.elabor.biz/Maurolico/index.html",****,"Abbatis Francisci Maurolyci Messanensis.

","French translation of Giovanni Antonio Magini‚Äôs work on spherical burning mirrors. Magini's interest was practical and craft-based, as well as theoretical.  He presented large concave spherical mirrors to Jacopo Boncompagni (son of Pope Gregory XIII and Prince of Sora), to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (son Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma), and to the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, and  the Duke of Mantua. Spherical mirrors were of keen interest to Galileo as well. Indeed, Maginis' text was written at Galileo‚Äôs request in order to facilitate the Grand Duke‚Äôs purchase of Magini‚Äôs curved mirrors through the mediation of Galileo.||Ettore Ausonio had produced a widely circulated manuscript <i>Theorica Speculi Concavi Sphaerici<i> in which concave spherical mirrors were analyzed. Particular attention given to focusing properties. Magini saw this through the press, appearing at Bologna in 1602. It was this work that Magini had decided to edit and then completely revise and publish as his 'Brief Instructions' which appeared in 1611. In addition to this French translation that appeared in 1620, the Italian text was published again at Bologna in 1628. ","Magini brief text begins with methods for describing concave spherical mirrors and the effects that they can produced using the sun. Using laws of reflection, two 'fundamental principles' are presented that can be used to understand the operation of all mirrors and the determination of a focal point or the 'point of inversion.' Different image sizes and placements are described, based on position of object and viewing point, including number, magnification, and minification.  Application of a spherical mirror in the camera obscura is also described. The material is descriptive, with only geometry invoked in the demonstrations. Twelve woodblock images appear in the text.

"Kircher, Athanasius SJ","Athanasius Kircher, SJ",," ",1601-1680,,," ",Primiti√¶ gnomonic√¶ catoptric√¶,"Athanasius Kircher's very early work on the construction and operation of sundials that function by reflected light.","The <i>Primitiae Gnomonicae Catoptricae<i> is a very early work of Kircher's on the construction and operation of sundials functioning by reflected light. Interest in sundials had expanded greatly since the early Renaissance and Kircher's work is a summary of the developments made in this art in the previous century. Among the earliest being the <i>Compositio Horologiorum<i> of 1531 and the <i>Typus Universalis Horologiorum Muralium<i> of 1533, both by Sebastian M√ºnster. A work likely known to Kircher was Rafael Mirami's <i>Compendiosa Introduttione alla Prima Parte della Specularia<i> of 1582, in which reflective mural sundials were first described. By the time he wrote the <i>Primitiae Gnomonicae Catoptricae<i>, Kircher had studied horological works and had designed and built two mural sundials for churches.|For Kircher, solar horology was a part of optics and thought it part of the art of light and shadow. Light and its reflection are treated in a completely traditional Scholastic manner, with the elementary geometric aspects of Euclidian optics used as necessary. The material in the <i>Primitiae Gnomonicae Catoptricae<i> would be later reused in Kircher‚Äôs much large work, the <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae<i> of 1646.
","Kircher's <i>Primitiae Gnomonicae Catoptricae<i> is in two books. Book 1: On the Nature and Properties of Reflected Light. The book begins with 13 definitions that present a mix of scholastic teaching on light and reflection and the simpler parts of Euclidean geometric optics. The distinction is made between lux and lumen, between internal and propagated light. Lumen travels in straight lines that can be traced with luminous rays. The Cathetus Rule is used to locate rays after reflection from a mirror's surface. Ten theorems present the fundamental geometry of Euclidian reflection and an additional 11 theorems are devoted to the sun's path in the sky. The book closes with a consideration of the parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptical mirrors. Book 2: Methods of Constructing Sundials by Rays of Reflected Light. After describing the differences between sundials that work by shadow casting and those that work catoptrically, the book then presents 29 Problems. Each problem presents and solves various aspects of constructing sundials that operate by reflected light. The basis for most of these is the 'bow tie' projection of solar position onto a plane. The catoptrical sundials include those that reflect sunlight into a space and onto a surface, plane or curved, delineated to mark the time. Woodcut figures accompany the text.","<i>La Meridiana a Riflessione fu Inventata da Raffaele Mirami?<i>|Saverino, N.|http://nicolaseverino.it, 2007.||<i>Athanasius Kricher's Theatre of the World<i>|Godwin, J.|Inner Traditions, Rochester, 2009, 304 pp, NB: pp 198-206.",****,"Primitiae gnomonicae catoptricae hos est horologiographiae novae specularis.

Closely following Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i>, it states but does not use the sine law of refraction.","Pierre H√©rigone is actually a pseudonym for the Baron Cl√©ment Cyriaque de Mangin. <i>Cursus Mathematici<i> is his popular 5-volume mathematical encyclopedia, which appeared between 1634 and 1642 and in which he introduced his version and development of Fran√ßois Vi√®te's symbolic language. H√©rigone considered it useful in Pure and Mixed Mathematics and used it throughout the <i>Cursus Mathematici<i>. In this fifth and last volume, H√©rigone deals with optics, catoptrics, dioptrics and perspective, among other topics. With text in French and Latin, it closely following Kepler's Dioptrice, and states but does not use the sine law of refraction. H√©rigone text presents optics immediately before the influence of Descartes and, as stated in his preface, is part of his effort to present an encyclopedic summary of all knowledge with concision and accessibility. The latter is clear from his unusual arrangement of presenting his text in Latin and French, side-by-side. Though read and mentioned by Pierre Fermat, Charles Cavendish,  and Giovanni Borelli, and Isaac Barrow, the influence of H√©rigone's work was limited--it was soon eclipsed by Descartes'. Editions appeared at Paris in 1634-1637 and in 1644.
","H√©rigone's 5th volume covers optics, perspective, spherical astronomy, spherical trigonometry, theory of the planets, gnomics, and music. The 5th volume begins with the optics of Euclid, stating the definitions and elementary parts of geometric optics. The descriptions and proofs of the 61 propositions of geometric optics use H√©rigone's famous mathematical symbology. The presentation of the eye and vision is modern, borrowing the image of the eye from Scheiner's Oculus of 1619 and the description of ocular function from Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604. Euclid's catoptrics is then presented in 33 propositions, again presented and proved with the concision of H√©rigone's symbolic method. The topics include plane and curved mirrors and their focal points. The material on dioptrics is a paraphrase of Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> of 1611 and it is here that H√©rigone states the sine law of refraction--though it is not actually used in the text. The operation of single and multiple lenses are considered and their effect on vision. In all, the optics material involves 190 pages and is essentially a summary of traditional Euclidian optics and catoptric and modern Keplerian dioptrics and vision. Where geometric or trigonometric proofs are required, H√©rigone's symbolic methods are used.","Kepler's legacy: Telescopes and geometrical optics, 1611-1669|Malet, A.|In: <i>The Origins of the Telescope<i>, KNAW Press, Amsterdam, 2010, pp 281-300.||Pierre H√©rigone In: http://dictionnaire.sensagent.leparisien.fr||Keplerian Astronomy after Kepler: Researches and Problems|Applebaum, W.|<i>History of Science<i>, Vol 34, No 4, 1996, pp 451-504.||Symbolic language in early modern mathematics: The Algebra of Pierre H√©rigone (1580‚Äì1643)|Esteve, R.M.|<i>Historia Mathematica<i>, Vol 35, No 4, 2008, pp 285-301.",****,"Cursus Mathematici tomus quintus ac ultimus.

","Claude Mydorge's commentary, analysis, and notes on the 1630 edition of Leurechon's <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i>. This edition contains the original forward by Leurechon and a preface from the publisher of the edition of 1630, Rolet Boutonn√©, regarding Mydorge's notes. It is stated there that Mydorge's notes were in unpublished circulation for a number of years and then used without consent in earlier editions. Mydorge was eventually  prevailed upon to get them into print. The publisher of this edition, Anthoine Robinot, simply reprinted this preface; replacing  Boutonn√©'s name with his. There are notes labeled with the acronym D.H.P.E.M., signifying Denis Henrion, that had been added in 1627. To these are added 'examinations' by Mydorge, labeled with his D.A.L.G. This and subsequent editions contain three parts: The original 91 Problems, annotated and examined by Henrion and Mydorge; An additional 45 Problems on optics, geometry and mechanics perhaps by Mydorge; Seventeen short chapters on artillery and fireworks, probably by Jean Appier Hanzelet,  coming as they do from his <i>Receuil de Plusiers Machines Militaires<i> of 1620. The latter two section have their own title page.||The commentaries and explanations contributed by Henrion to the mathematical problems and by Mydorge to the optical ones added significantly to the value of the book. It was now a book of popular sciences, and the subsequent printings, editions, and enlargements demonstrate its popularity. Thirty editions in French appeared between 1624 and 1680. Jacques Ozanam began editing editions in 1694, adding material and changing the content to be more like an encyclopedia. Jean-Etienne Montucla and Edm√© Gilles Guyot were subsequent editors and by 1769 there were four volumes. Translations appeared in English, Latin, Dutch, and German. 
","This and subsequent editions of <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i> omit the dedicatory letter signed by H. Van Etten, though his note about 'Five or Six things' and a preface to the reader from the author which names some of his sources and the general nature of what he tried to accomplish is retained. This is followed by a table on contents titled 'Recueil de Principlales Faceties Mathematical Recreations Contained in the Booklet According to Problem Numbers'. The sections listed are: Arithmetic, Geometry, Optics and Perspective, Music, Cosmographical Matters. There follows the first section with 91 'Problems' in these various subjects. The camera obscura, burning mirrors and lenses, plane and curved mirrors, clear and colored looking-glasses, and the rainbow are presented in a rudimentary way. In early editions, the optical material is limited to display and demonstration, with the original text giving little or no explanation of the phenomena itself. Most of the problems involving optics and some involving mechanics have added 'examinations' by Claude Mydorge. The are usually detailed provide an explanation for the phenomenon described in the problem. There are a few problems in the second section devoted to optics and projection. These have a very different character than the original problems of section one--more detailed and  explanatory, rather than just presentational. The problems in the first section and their examinations, and the problems in the second section, never involve mathematics above the simplest geometry, thus maintaining their popular science character.",See Entry 80.,****,"Examen du livre des recreations mathematiques et de ses problems en Geometrie, Mechanique, Optique, & Catoptrique.

"Descartes, Rene",Rene Descartes,," ",1596-1650,"√âtienne de Courcelles (1586-1659)  Friend of Descartes, Arminian Greek scholar and translator.",,"Edited by √âtienne de Courcelles (1586-1659)  Friend of Descartes, Arminian Greek scholar and translator.",Specimina philosophi√¶,"The <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> is the Latin translation of Descartes' Discours de la Methode of 1637, except for its third essay La G√©om√©trie. The <i>Specimina<i> is responsible for the general accessibility and wide-spread advance of Cartesian natural philosophy.
","The Latin translation of Descartes' <i>Discours de la M√©thode<i> has its origins before the French edition appeared late in 1637; Descartes had written earlier to Marin Mersenne about preparing a Latin version himself. In 1638 Descartes gathered comments and objections from readers including Libertus Fromond of Louvain, Vopiscus Plemp, Pierre Fermat, Blaise Pascal, Gilles de Roberval, Jean-Baptiste Morin, and Alphonse Pollot. Most of these objections were written in Latin and so Descartes asked Mersenne to tell his other correspondents to write in Latin. Evidently, by summer 1638 Descartes was planning a second edition of the <i>Discours<i>, in Latin, containing the objections he had received and his answers. But this was set aside, and work began on a second edition in French, with Descartes making corrections and Mersenne acting as editor. But Descartes' publisher, Jan Maire, reported that the first French edition sold very poorly and that a second French edition was not economically practical; Mersenne stopped his editorial work and the project was dropped.||Printed versions of <i>La Dioptrique<i> and <i>Les Meteores<i> had circulated even before the complete <i>Discours<i> appeared in 1637 and not long after, a Latin translations of the <i>Discours, La Dioptrique<i>, and <i>Les Meteores<i> were circulating. Descartes obtained a copy and made corrections and changes intended for the second French edition. The Latin translation--titled <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i>--is traditionally attributed to Etienne de Courcelles, though the evidence is only indirect from Adrien Baillet, the biographer of Descartes. By 1644 Elsevier was publishing Descartes' <i>Principia Philosophiae<i> and proposed to publish the <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> as well. Jan Maire refused to sell the woodcuts for the figures to Elsevier, and so new (and poorer) ones were produced. Baillet states that the <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> appeared without <i>La G√©om√©trie<i> because Courcelles did not have mastery of the subject or that it was known that Van Schooten has already translated it.||The <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> was widely read, influenced natural philosophy profoundly, and marked the real beginning of Cartesianism. It was the <i>Specimina<i>, not the <i>Discours<i>, that was studied by natural philosophers for more than two centuries, was the fons et origo of textbooks for students, and it was here that Europe first read 'Cogito, ergo sum'. Editions appeared at Amsterdam in 1644, twice at Amsterdam in 1650, twice at Amsterdam in 1656, twice at Amsterdam in 1664, at London in 1664, at Amsterdam in 1672, 1677, 1685, twice at Amsterdam in 1692, and at Frankfurt in 1692. 
","The <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> contains Latin translations of two of the three essays Descartes wrote to demonstrate his new method of natural philosophy: La Dioptrique on optics and  vision, Les Meteores on atmospheric phenomena. La Dioptrique has three principal topics: 1, the nature of light and the laws of optics, 2, vision, and 3, dioptric improvement of vision. These are covered in 10 sections: nature of light, law of refraction, ocular anatomy, the senses in general, image formation in the eye, visual perception, quality of vision, figure of spectacles, microscopes and telescopes, methods for figuring lenses.  Les Meteores contains the correct explanation of the geometric aspects of the primary and secondary rainbows.","<i>A Bibliography of the Works of Descartes I & II<i>|van Otegem, M.|Quaestiiones Infinitae, Vol 37|Publications of the Leiden-Utrecht Research Institute of Philosophy, Utrecht, 2002, 780 pp, NB pp 29-37.||<i>Ren√© Descartes: Specimina Philosophiae, Introduction and Critical Edition<i>|Vermeulen, C.L.|Quaestiones Infinitae, Vol 53|Publications of the Leiden-Utrecht Research Institute of Philosophy, Utrecht, 2007.||ùëª<i> Ren√© Descartes: Discourse on Method, Optics, Geometry, and Meteorology<i>|Translated with Introduction by Paul J.

Like the earlier version, it is a detailed, geometrically practical guide to anamorphosis. That is, the production of distorted perspective images on plane or curved surfaces that require viewing points. As the Latin title implies, Niceron came to consider anamorphosis a type of natural magic or wonder-working. In his Preface to the reader, Niceron set out his plan for reworking the text of 1638: A section giving the principles of geometry followed by revised books one and two, and these followed by a section on a new scenographic instrument and an appendix on Light and Shadow. There was to be a second part containing revisions of books three and four of the 1638 text on catoptric and dioptric anamorphosis. Niceron worked on the Thaumaturgus Opticus for eight years after the publication of 1638 but his early death in 1646 prevented him from completing what was to be the second half of the work. His fellow Minim member Marin Mersenne edited the manuscript. Niceron's plan must have been fixed from the start, for the revised book one contains references to books three and four. The geometric prelude that precedes Book One is a close Latin translation of the French original. The reworked Books One and Two are considerable expansions of the originals, with more theorems, propositions, and detail.||Niceron had continued to work on practical anamorphosis and the <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i> since <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> of 1638, and so his experience had deepened the detail and examples he brought to the revised work was considerably richer. In 1638 the first two books were accompanied by 10 plates of figures, in 1646 by 35 plates. The last eight plates are devoted to Niceron's scenography and his appendix on light and shadow. The title frontispiece was drawn by Simon Vouet and engraved by Charles Audran. The portrait, executed by Michel Lasne, shows Niceron not long before his death.||With <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i>, Niceron's significant advances in perspective projection methods over his predecessors Salomon de Caus and Jean-Louis Vaulezard are more developed and reach a wider audience. Edited by Mersenne, it appeared posthumously in 1646 and edited by Roberval in 1663.
","Jean-Francois Niceron's <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i> begins with Geometric Preliminaries, followed by two books on anamorphosis, then a description of a scenographic instrument, and ends with an appendix on light and shadow. The Preliminaries set out geometric basics in 8 Propositions and two appendices. Book 1: Principles of Perspective. Describes a general method for the linear perspective of solid figures, included the complex cases where the figures contact the horizontal plane only along a line or at a point. The process is fundamentally geometric and presented in 12 axioms, 37 Propositions, and a synopsis. Each proposition is demonstrated with one or more figures. Examples of the process are give for several solid objects. Book 2: Planar Anamorphosis. Projections are introduced for distorting a regular image so that it appears undistorted only when viewed from a particular viewing point. The undistorted rectangular grid of the image is mapped into a grid distorted by projection. The process is presented in 12 Propositions accompanied by figures. The material in both books is presented with a brevity that requires close reading and careful reference to the many figures in the plates. The Universal Scenograph describes a device of Niceron's invention that allows by direct viewing the drawing of an object in linear or anamorphic projection. It operates as an optical-mechanical equivalent of Durer's perspective grid. The Appendix on Light and Shadow demonstrates techniques for drawing shadows in linear perspective. Interestingly, it includes not only umbral shadows from point light sources but also penumbral shadows from area light sources such as windows. Both the Universal Scenograph and the Appendix are accompanied by plates of figures.","Jean Fran√ßois Niceron: Perspective and Artificial Magic|DeRose, A.|<i>FME Transactions<i>, Vol  45, No 2, 2017, pp 215-226.||The Mathematical Treatment of Anamorphoses from Piero della Francesca to Niceron|Andersen, K.|In: <i>History of Mathematics: States of the Art<i>|Academic Press, San Diego, 1996.||The refractive anamorphic viewer of J.-F.

Algebra and geometry combined to give Analytic Geometry, in a language and explanatory style that produced a book of wide influence.
","Van Schooten knew Ren√© Descartes in 1632 and read his <i>La G√©om√©trie<i> while it was still unpublished. Like virtually all other readers of the original French text of La G√©om√©trie, Van Schooten found it difficult to understand. Nevertheless, he recognized its importance and so reworked the text, added clarifying explanations and commentaries, and translated the result into Latin. It was from Van Schooten's Latin text that Europe's mathematical community learned of Descartes's work.  In the decade following the appearance of the 1649 text, Van Schooten worked with other mathematicians to produce a two volume work containing greatly extended commentaries. This two volume work appeared in 1659 and 1651. It was from this edition that Leibniz and Newton would learn of Descartes's analytic geometry.||Descartes‚Äôs friend Florimond de Beaune wrote the introduction to the 1649 edition. Editions of the Latin text appeared in 1649, 1659, and 1683.
","Descartes's La G√©om√©trie is in three books. Book I applies algebra to geometry to solve many of classical construction problems in geometry; finding points, line lengths, and curves. Book II presents analytic geometry more fully, dealing with the algebraic expression of geometric curves, their use, and their manipulation. Part of this book deals with optics and the use of coordinate geometry to solve optical problems. It is here that Descartes the anaclastic surfaces now called Descartes' Ovals.  Book III takes up geometry construction problems again but in greater detail and with the full power of analytic geometry. Descartes formulates construction problems algebraically, solves the algebraic equations, and then interprets the solutions in geometric terms.||In Descartes's original text he claimed that 'Any problem in geometry can easily be reduced to such terms that a knowledge of the length of certain straight lines is sufficient for construction.' He showed how arithmetic, algebra, and geometry could be combined to solve problems. Descartes believed that the systematic application of algebra to what is now called coordinate geometry could produce solutions to problems that geometry alone was powerless to do. Algebraic coordinate geometry had a generality and mechanizing-like process that gave it great power. He used it, for example, to demonstrate procedures for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing line segments and for graphically determining roots of equations. The extreme concision and lack of explanation made the text difficult to follow; thus the value and influence of Van Schooten's translation, examples, and commentary.","<i>The Geometry of Ren√© Descartes<i>|Smith, D.E, and Latham, M.|Dover, 1954.",****,"Geometria a Renato Des Cartes Anno 1637 Gallice edita; nunc autem Cum Notis Florimundi de Beaune, In Curia Blaesensi Consiliarii Regii, in linguam Latinam versa, & commentariis illustrata, Opera atque studio Fancisci a Schooten, Leydensis in Academia Lugduno-Batava, Mathesoes Professoris, Belgice docentis.","Geometry by Ren√© Descartes, published in French in 1637; But now, with the notes of Florimond de Beaune Royal Counselor in the Court of Blois, translated into Latin and Elucidated by Commenarties, by the Effort and Care of Frans van Schooten of Leiden, Professor of Mathematics in the University of Leiden, Docent of Belgium.",1649,1625-1650,"French philosopher and mathematician.

Though citing and considering many authors, he accepts Cartesian optical ideas.","The origins of <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i> are manuscripts on optics and catoptrics  Mersenne left at the time of his death in 1648; the later less complete than the former. These works define the end of an arc of ideas that began with his <i>Quaestiones Celeberrimae<i> of 1623 and developed in his <i>Optica<i>  as part of  the <i>Universae mixtaeque geometriae mathematicae synopsis<i> of 1644. Mersenne was a committed Aristotelianism and attempted to accommodate the developments in Johannes Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604 with Scholastic teaching in optics. With the advent of Ren√© Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i> of 1637 and Thomas Hobbes' <i>Tractatus Opticus<i> (published by Mersenne in 1644), he established a synthesis of Cartesian and Hobbesian ideas. This is the  <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i>, which, unlike his earlier work, is not a compendium but rather a series of proposition that state what to Mersenne were the most likely explanations for light and optical phenomena. By 1648 and the writing of the <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i>, Mersenne had adopted Descartes' idea on the nature of light and vision. He does, however, present Descartes' sine law of refraction underpinned with Hobbes' analogy of light as physically moving lines or 'ray fronts.' Unlike the dogmatic Cartesianism that many would later adopt, Mersenne was flexible, always open to alternatives in natural philosophy, and prepared to present and weigh differing views.||Gilles Personne de Roberval is credited with editing Mersenne's manuscripts (which Roberval named <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i>), it is known that he had to do more than just edit. Even though Roberval hewed close to Mersenne's ideas, he added considerably to the text, filled many lacunae, and clarified many sections.||<i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i> marks the mid-17th century transition from Scholastic teaching on optics to an accommodation of the developments of Kepler and Descartes. It appeared in 1651 and 1663, often bound with the third edition of Niceron's <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i>, which was also edited by Roberval.
","Roberval's editing of Mersenne's <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i> has a preface from the publisher followed by two books. In a few initial sentences, the preface states the intention of bringing Mersenne's last optics thoughts into print. The next six pages are, strangely, devoted to a long posthumous defense of Mersenne against the charge brought by Jesuits that he had endorsed a method for squaring the circle. Book 1 is devoted to optics and presents 31 Propositions. The first 9 propositions present the sources, nature, and propagation of light, with luminous rays being the explanatory mechanism. Kepler's influence is very clear, including the inverse-square relationship of distance and illumination. Proposition 10 gives Mersenne's mechanico-ballistic explanation for reflection. Propositions 11-14 deal with illumination and primitive photometry. The power of sunlight is compared to that of candles by way of the inverse-square distance law. Propositions 15-21 deal with the camera obscura and its uses to produce images and assess light sources. Propositions 22 and 23 are on color and shadow. Propositions 24-31 discuss the eye, the process of vision, and visual perceptions. Book 2 is devoted to catoptrics and presents 16 Propositions. The first 5 are on the nature of reflection and a consideration of the various theories that have been proposed to explain the equal-angle law of reflection. Propositions 6-8 consider different types and forms of mirrors. Proposition 10 considers reflected rays and their paths to the eyes. Propositions 11-15 consider image formation by mirrors, magnification, blur. Proposition 16 is on burning mirrors.||The material is on the nature of light is Cartesian, but that on the physics of light is deeply tinctured by Hobbes' physics. The material on the eye and vision is taken directly from Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i>. The arguments or demonstrations of the propositions are by way of analogy; the only mathematics involved is elementary geometry. The material on catoptrics is on the nature and cause of reflection and the general properties of mirrors; it is not what would have been considered geometrical optics.","‚ÅÇThe Development of Mersenne's Optics|Cozzoli, D.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 18, No 1, 2010, pp 9-25.||Roberval ¬´√©diteur¬ª de Mersenne et du P.

Designed to entertain and instruct. The source for the arithmetical problems was Claude Bachet's <i>Problems Plaisans et Delectables<i> of 1612. The problems in geometry are in the Renaissance tradition of 'practical geometry'; geometry applied to surveying, mensuration, and fortification. Many of the other problems come from the tradition of secretes and natural magic, such as Girolamo Ruscelli's <i>De' Secretis del Alessio Piemontese<i> in the edition of 1615. Some of the problems in natural philosophy appear to be from works by Giambattista Della Porta, Girolamo Cardano, and Salomon de Caus. Renaissance books on conjuring and prestidigitation were a source for the <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i>.|Tradition has assigned authorship to the Jesuit Jean Leurechon, though there is little scholarly evidence for this.

Thirty editions in French appeared between 1624 and 1680. Denis Henrion and Claude Mydorge were contributors and commentators for editions between 1626 and 1639, adding significant value to the book.

He referred to this as 'physico-mathematics' and was his replacement for Scholastic teachings in natural philosophy. Optics was a life-long interest of Descartes, and his earliest study was that of refraction, written in 1619-1921. The first full expression of these and other ideas was his <i>La Monde<i>, nearly completed by 1633, but not published in his lifetime due to the shock created by the condemnation of Galileo in that year. <i>La Monde<i> set out Descartes' mechanical theory of light, described vortex celestial mechanics, and advanced a Copernican cosmography.||Criticisms and commentaries Descartes received after the <i>Discours<i> appeared in 1637 prompted him to consider a second French edition which would include objections and responses. But by 1639 the publisher Jean Maire reported that the book had sold poorly and a second French edition was not practical. In 1644 a Latin translation appeared, lightly edited by Descartes and lacking the <i>La Geometrie<i>. The Latin would sell well and begin the advance of Cartesian thought in Europe. The initial intellectual interest in Descartes' work was limited to the natural philosophy contained in the essays. Within 30 years, Descartes' physics was augmented with an experimental component, became part of the teaching curriculum in an ever-larger number of schools, and formed the basis of widely used textbooks. Cartesian physics would sweep aside Scholasticism and be dominant in Europe until the rise of Newtonianism in the first quarter of the 18th century.||This edition is a very close reprinting of the text of 1637, excluding <i>La Geometrie<i>. The latter had been found too technical for general reading, and a separate edition of a Latin translation of <i>La Geometrie<i> with commentary had by this time been produced by van Schooten, so it was not printed in this or subsequent editions. It is known that the edition of 1637 did not sell well, and the same was true for this edition. At the time of publisher Henry le Gras' death in 1662, there were still 480 copies unsold. Editions of the French text of the <i>Discours<i> appeared at Leiden in 1637 and at Paris in 1658, and twice in 1668.

"Du Hamel, Jean-Baptiste CO","Jean-Baptiste Du Hamel, CO",," ",1624-1706,,," ",Astronomia Physica,"A work on the nature of light and colors and planetary astronomy. Unimpressed with Descartes or Gassendi, the presentation on light and color is strictly Aristotelian.  All in the form of a classic scholastic dialog.
","Jean-Baptiste Du Hamel's work on light and color is a summary of then-current theories of Gassendi and Descartes set against traditional Aristotelian teaching. 'Modern' theories are considered, explained, and found wanting. His work on planetary astronomy has its root in his early <i>Elementa Astronomia<i> of 1643 and considers: the nature and motion of celestial bodies; various theories of the motion of the earth, moon, and sun; the fixed stars; and various aspects of practical observational astronomy. Both the optical and astronomical material is presented in the form of a Galilean dialogue involving Simplicius (expressing the views of La Chambre), Meander (expressing the views of Descartes), and Theophilus (the views of Honor√© Fabri).||Though Du Hamel had a considerable reputation during his life--first secretary and historian of the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences--his works of this type were of little influence, being essentially summaries and reactionary defenses of Aristotelianism. Nevertheless, and for that very reason, the <i>Astronomia Physica<i> marks and documents the mounting struggle against Cartesianism in France.||Editions appeared in 1660 and again in the <i>Operum Philosophicorum<i> of 1681.
","Du Hamels' work is in two books. Book 1: On Light and Color; Book 2: On the Nature and Motion of Celestial Bodies. The book on light and color (60 pages) has four chapters. Chapter 1: On the Nature of Light; Chapter 2: On the Motion of Light; Chapter 3: On the Cause of Light; Chapter 4: On the Nature and Diversity of Color.||Chapter 1 presents the Peripatetic theory of light with the distinction between lux and lumen, the Epicurean theory of Gassendi in which light is an effluvium continuously emitted by luminous objects, and the Cartesian in which light an impulse in an aetherial substance that fills the plenum. All are rejected and the Aristotelian theory is defended. Chapter 2 presents light diffusing from all points on a luminous object, until it strikes an opaque surface and is reflected, or a transparent surface and is refracted. Various laws of and mechanisms for refraction are presented. Chapter 3 briefly examines the Aristotelian causes of light and the nature of vision. Chapter 4 presents a color theory similar to La Chambre, with color being fixed and innate and the distinction between real and apparent colors is incorrect. The number and sequence of colors is also discussed.||The material is presented in the form of a Galilean dialogue involving Simplicius (expressing the views of La Chambre), Meander (expressing the views of Descartes), and Theophilus (the views of Honor√© Fabri). The arguments made by Meander are, by far, the weakest. The presentation is entirely descriptive, no mathematics of any kind is used.||Appended at the end of Book 2 are a series of papers by Petit on the solar eclipse visible from Paris on 14 November 1639, on magnetic dip, and on the system of the world.","De kleurtheorie van de Aristotelianen en de opvattingen van De la Chambre, Duhamel en Vossius in de periode 1640‚Äì1670 (in Dutch)|MacLean, J.|<i>Scientiarum Historia<i>, Vol 10, 1968, pp 209-225.",****,"Astronomia Physica seu de luce, natura, et motibus corporum caelestium libro duo.

Bound with Bourdin's larger but similar works on geometry and military fortification, with an expanded, separately-titled, 25-page section devoted to optics.","Third, considerably expanded posthumous edition of Bourdin's <i>Le Cours de Math√©matique<i> has its origin in a course he taught at the Coll√®ge de Clermont beginning in 1636. Its content was informed by the Jesuit's Ratio Studiorum. Existing student notes reveal a very modern pedagogy based on images and figures. Bourdin drew and etched the figures used in the course, had them printed, and distributed them to his students to lighten the note-taking burden and assure accuracy. The etchings and notes form the basis for <i>Le Cours de Mathematique<i>. The course presents a brief introduction to several fields of Mixed Mathematics appropriate for engineers: Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Mechanics, Optics, and Cosmography. Each is presented by a plate of figures accompanied by numbered notes that are topic outlines and references to figures. Unlike previous editions, Bourdin's material on geometry and fortification is not separated from the main text, but a new, separate 25-page section on optics is added.||It is over optics that in 1640 Bourdain began to famously tangle with Ren√© Descartes, principally over Descartes' plenum of subtle matter, and the mechanisms of reflection and refraction. Editions of <i>Le Cours de Math√©matique<i> appeared in 1641, 1645, and in 1661. 
","Pierre Bourdin's <i>Le Cours de Mathematique<i> presents a brief introduction to several fields of Mixed Mathematics: Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Mechanics, Optics and Vision, and Cosmography. Each is presented by a plate of 9 figures, each figure demonstrating a fundamental element and accompanied by numbered notes that are topic outlines with references to figures.  The coverage is of the greatest possible concision and is clearly designed to support a course of lectures that would provide necessary detail. The separate section on optics presents figures and notes for: The eye and ocular anatomy, Laws of Vision, Visual Perception, Vison by Direct, Reflected, and Refracted View, Spectacles and Optical Instruments, Keeping Good Vision, Mechanism of Vision and Formation of Images, Perspective View, Camera Obscura and Telescopes, Magnifiers, Plane Mirrors, Convex and Concave Mirrors, Anamorphosis Mirrors, Burning Mirrors.

"Voss, Isaac",Isaac Voss,Isaac Vossius,Also Known As: Isaac Vossius,1618-1689,,," ",De lucis natura et proprietate,"The nature of light and refraction. Adhering to image formation ideas from Witelo and Alhazen rather than those of ray propagation of Kepler. Famously accused Descartes of plagiarism by presenting a manuscript of Snell that shows the sine law of refraction.
","Isaac Voss' <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> has its origins with Voss' study of the optical phenomena reported by  Pomponius Mela involving, the sea, the atmosphere, and the rising sun. In his commentary on Mela of 1658, Voss added an extended note offering an explanation for the phenomena. In doing so he set down several controversial claims that departed significantly from generally accepted ideas. The most bumptious of which was that refraction does not take place only at the interface between two media of different densities, but rather continuously throughout a medium. The denser the medium, the more pronounced the continuous refraction. The most important and detailed response to Voss' claims was from Pierre-Daniel Huet, Voss' friend, colleague in philology, and cleric-scholar from Caen. Huet objected to Voss claims about the atmosphere and how it refracts, but most strenuously to the claim that refraction is continuous in a medium. The <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> is essentially an extended reply to Huet's objections. In it, the treatment of optics is based on visual perception and images, rather than Keplerian ray propagation. That is, from visual phenomena Voss deduces physical phenomena, rather than the other way around. Though an anti-Cartesian, Voss was not an Aristotelian--he had developed his own peculiar ideas regarding optics.||The <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> contains Voss' recounting of his examination of a manuscript of Willebrord Snell and that he discovered the sine law of refraction before Descartes and its appearance in his La Dioptrique of 1637. This alone made the book popular. Though widely read, the book's collection of extreme differences from Keplerian and Cartesian optics generated wide-spread negative reaction among Cartesians. One was the publication in 1664 of <i>De Natura Ignis, Lucis et Colorum Dissertatio<i> by Andr√© Graindorge, a close acquaintance of Pierre-Daniel Huet. Voss would publish a response in the form of the Appendix <i>ad Scriptum de Natura et Proprietate Lucis<i>, added at the end of his <i>De Nili<i> of 1666.
","Isaac Voss' <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> has 32 Chapters. Chapters 1-4 cover the theory of light, presenting and dismissing both Cartesian and Gassendian ideas, maintaining instead that light is a type of luminous fire. Chapters 5-13 consider non-corporeal rays of light and their motion in vacuum. Chapters 14-23 presents Voss' ideas on continuous refraction, and refraction in air, water, glass objects. It is in chapter 16 that Voss recounts what he learned from examining a manuscript of Willebrord Snell and in chapter 18 that atmospheric refraction is considered. Chapters 24-28 are on color, which is presented as an entity separate from light, the intrinsic 'sulfurous quality' of an object. Chapters 29-32 cover various aspects of visual perception including the appearance of coronae, the apparent size of objects, what refraction does to solar and lunar observations, and refraction in general.||Voss adheres to image formation ideas from Witelo and Alhazen rather than those of ray propagation of Kepler, emphasizing the continuity of optical phenomena that take place throughout a transparent material, and not at (just) its surface. That is, Voss contends that light is continuously interacting with the transparent medium through which it travels, and so refraction is continuous, as appearances in some visual experiments seem to support.","‚ÅÇ A View from the Mountaintop: The Development of Isaac Vossius' Optics, 1658-1666|Dijksterhus, F.J.|In: <i>Isaac Vossius (1618-1689) between Science and Scholarship<i>, Brill, Leiden, 2012, pp 159-187.||De kleurtheorie van de Aristotelianen en de opvattingen van De la Chambre, Dulianiel en Vossius in de periode 1640-1670|MacLean, J.|<i>Scientiarum Historia<i>, Vol 10, 1968, pp 209-225.",****,De lucis natura et proprietate,On the Nature and Properties of Light,1662,1650-1675,"Dutch scholar, linguist, libraian, and book collector on a grand scale.

"Niceron, Jean Francois OM","Jean Francois Niceron, OM",," ",1613-1646,"Gilles Personne de Roberval (1602-1675) French mathematician, founding member of the French Academy of Sciences.",e,"Edited by Gilles Personne de Roberval (1602-1675) French mathematician, founding member of the French Academy of Sciences.",La Perspective Curieuse,"Roberval's editing of the final, augmented text on anamorphosis produced by Niceron and overseen by Mersenne.","Jean-Francois Niceron's <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> is a detailed, geometrically practical guide to anamorphosis. That is, the production of distorted perspective images on plane or curved surfaces that require special mirrors or viewing points. For Niceron, optics as an illusionist art, rather than a science of light and vision. As the title implies, Niceron considered anamorphosis a type of perspective, engaging the question of visual representation and the reliability of the visual sense. In his Letter to the Reader, Niceron lists the great developers of and contributors to the science of perspective but notes how few books on the subject do little more than display figures and scenes, without showing in detail how they were produced. He states that his goal is to remedy that for readers of French and that the title, Curious Perspective, could also have been Artificial Magic--'The one that produces for us the most beautiful and admirable effects, bringing about the art and industry of man.' He cautions new readers not to skip the initial material on geometry or the initial drawing exercises. Published when he was 25, Niceron had been working on anamorphosis (direct, catoptric, and dioptric) since he was 18 and a novice in the Order of Minims, and so the work is that of a practitioner with a deep understanding of geometry, not that of just a theoretician. With La Perspective Curieuse, Niceron makes significant advances in perspective projection methods from his predecessors Salomon de Caus and Jean-Louis Vaulezard. This is particularly the case for spherical projection; without Niceron's technique, interior dome work would have been beyond the ability of virtually all painters. This aspect of Niceron's work also affected the design of instruments, such as astrolabes and globes. La Perspective Curieuse was an acknowledged influence on Emmanuel Maignan's Horographia of 1648 and Charles Plumier's l' Art de Tourner en Perfection of 1749.||The plates were engraved by Joan Blanchin, based on Niceron‚Äôs drawings. Editions appeared in 1638 and edited by Roberval in 1651 and 1663. Niceron's Latin translation, <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i>, edited by Mersenne, appeared posthumously in 1646 and edited by Roberval in 1663.
","Jean-Francois Niceron's  <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> begins with a Geometric Preliminaries, followed by four books. The Preliminaries set out geometric basics in 7 Propositions. Book 1: Principles of Perspective. Describes a general method for the linear perspective of solid figures, included the complex cases where the figures contact the horizontal plane only along a line or at a point. The process is fundamentally geometric and presented in 15 Propositions, each demonstrated with one or more figures. Examples of the process are give for several solid objects. Book 2: Planar Anamorphosis. Projections are introduced for distorting a regular image so that it appears undistorted only when viewed from a particular viewing point. The undistorted rectangular grid of the image is mapped into a grid distorted by projection. The process is presented in 7 Propositions accompanied by figures. Book 3: Anamorphosis with Cylindrical and Conical Mirrors. Five Propositions and figures present the method for generating a doubly-projected grid. The rectangular grid of an image is mapped onto the projection and an undistorted view is presented only the appropriate mirror. Niceron gives practical advice on metal-casting for mirrors and instructions for their polishing. Book 4: Dioptric Anamorphosis. Five Propositions give the method for generating a projected grid that separate and distorts an image into several pieces. The projection depends on the nature of the intended facetted, dioptrical viewer. The rectangular grid of an image is segregated and distorted according to projected grid and reveals an assembled and undistorted image when viewed with the required facetted dioptric element. The material in all four books is presented with a brevity that requires close reading and careful reference to the many figures in the plates.","Roberval ¬´√©diteur¬ª de Mersenne et du P.

","Like many natural philosophers of the time, Robert Boyle was interested in color. For some years he had conducted various experiments involving light and color, recording the results in various forms and places. Pressed by friends, he returned to these separate pieces of years earlier and assembled them into an essay for private circulation, eventually appearing in print.

These experiments were not limited to strictly optical phenomena, but, being a chemist, often involved the changing, appearance, and disappearance of colors in various chemical experiments.

An edition revised by John Hoofnail appeared at London in 1738.
","Robert Boyle's <i>Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours<i> is a monologue addressed to 'Pyrophilus' and contains three parts. Part I is presentation of then-current knowledge about color and has five chapters covering Boyle's method and reason for experimentation, the general lack of experimental information about color, review of then-current color information and properties, the distinction between real and apparent colors, size color hypotheses rejected by Boyle. Part II presents an extended study and assessment of White and Black in two chapters. Here Boyle rejects the old idea that color arises from the mixing of white and black, properties of whiteness drawn from objects in nature, properties of blackness including it heat-holding properties. The part ends with a description of 15 experiments conducted on whiteness and blackness. Part III presents the results of 50 experiments related to color, including color perception, optical and prismatic colors, colors in chemistry, pigment colors, color from adding colored lights.||Boyle briefly summarizes the color theories of the Scholastics, Neoplatonists, Epicureans, and the Cartesians--and finds them all wanting. Importantly, his own idea is that color is light itself that has been modified in some way. He is aware of the vast array of color phenomena involving optics, chemistry, natural history, color in gems, phosphoric colors, and color phenomena that appear to be purely perceptual, and cannot conceive of a theoretical mechanism to explain them all. But his is more certain about his notions regarding whiteness and blackness: whiteness being produced by the surface of an object that consists of tiny surfaces the reflect most incident light into many directions, and blackness being produced by a surface that does not reflect light but absorbs it. Several of his experiments are conducted to demonstrates these ideas, particularly those involving the heating of black surfaces in sunlight. Importantly, Boyle considers whiteness and blackness a result of reflection and absorption, and not as primitives of color that are responsible in some fashion for their generation.||The text includes an appendix of observations Boyle made with a diamond that was said to be phosphorescent.","‚ÅÇ On Reading Boyle's 'Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours'|Kuehni, R.G.|<i>Color Research and Application<i>, Vol 18, No 3, pp 193-196.||Isaac Newton: The Rise of a Scientist 1661-1671|Lohne.

Part I is presentation of then-current knowledge about color and has five chapters covering Boyle's method and reason for experimentation, the general lack of experimental information about color, review of then-current color information and properties, the distinction between real and apparent colors, size color hypotheses rejected by Boyle. Part II presents an extended study and assessment of White and Black in two chapters. Here Boyle rejects the old idea that color arises from the mixing of white and black, properties of whiteness drawn from objects in nature, properties of blackness including it heat-holding properties. The part ends with a description of 15 experiments conducted on whiteness and blackness. Part III presents the results of 50 experiments related to color, including color perception, optical and prismatic colors, colors in chemistry, pigment colors, color from adding colored lights.||Boyle briefly summarizes the color theories of the Scholastics, Neoplatonists, Epicureans, and the Cartesians--and finds them all wanting. Importantly, his own idea is that color is light itself that has been modified in some way. He is aware of the vast array of color phenomena involving optics, chemistry, natural history, color in gems, phosphoric colors, and color phenomena that appear to be purely perceptual, and cannot conceive of a theoretical mechanism to explain them all. But his is more certain about his notions regarding whiteness and blackness: whiteness being produced by the surface of an object that consists of tiny surfaces the reflect most incident light into many directions, and blackness being produced by a surface that does not reflect light but absorbs it. Several of his experiments are conducted to demonstrates these ideas, particularly those involving the heating of black surfaces in sunlight. Importantly, Boyle considers whiteness and blackness a result of reflection and absorption, and not as primitives of color and responsible in some fashion for their generation.||The text includes an appendix of observations Boyle made with a diamond that was said to  be phosphorescent.","‚ÅÇ On Reading Boyle's 'Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours'|Kuehni, R.G.|<i>Color Research and Application<i>, Vol 18, No 3, pp 193-196.||Isaac Newton: The Rise of a Scientist 1661-1671|Lohne.

"Voss, Isaac",Isaac Voss,Isaac Vossius,Also Known As: Isaac Vossius,1618-1689,,," ",Ad Scriptum de nature et proprietate lucis,"A rebuttal to critics and clarification of the ideas regarding light and refraction presented in the <i>De Lucis Natura<i> of 1662.
","Isaac Voss' <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> has its origins with Voss' study of the optical phenomena reported by  Pomponius Mela involving the sea, the atmosphere, and the rising sun. In his commentary on Mela of 1658, Voss added an extended note offering an explanation for the phenomena. In doing so he set down several controversial claims that departed significantly from generally accepted ideas. The most bumptious of which was that refraction does not take place only at the interface between two media of different densities, but rather continuously throughout a medium. The denser the medium, the more pronounced the continuous refraction. The most important and detailed response to Voss' claims was from Pierre-Daniel Huet, Voss' friend, colleague in philology, and cleric-scholar from Caen. Huet objected to Voss claims about the atmosphere and how it refracts, but most strenuously to the claim that refraction is continuous in a medium. The <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> is essentially an extended reply to Huet's objections. In it, the treatment of optics is based on visual perception and images, rather than Keplerian ray propagation. That is, from visual phenomena Voss deduces physical phenomena, rather than the other way around. Though an anti-Cartesian, Voss was not an Aristotelian--he had developed his own peculiar ideas regarding optics.||The <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> contains Voss' recounting of his examination of a manuscript of Willebrord Snell and that he discovered the sine law of refraction before Descartes and its appearance in his <i>La Dioptrique<i> of 1637. This alone made the book popular. Though widely read, the book's collection of extreme differences from Keplerian and Cartesian optics generated wide-spread negative reaction among Cartesians. One was the publication in 1664 of <i>De Natura Ignis, Lucis et Colorum Dissertatio<i> by Andr√© Graindorge, a close acquaintance of Pierre-Daniel Huet. Voss would publish a response in the form of the <i>Appendix ad Scriptum de Natura et Proprietate Lucis<i>, added at the end of his <i>De Nili<i> of 1666.
","Isaac Voss' <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> has 32 Chapters. Chapters 1-4 cover the theory of light, presenting and dismissing both Cartesian and Gassendian ideas, maintaining instead that light is a type of luminous fire. Chapters 5-13 consider non-corporeal rays of light and their motion in vacuum. Chapters 14-23 presents Voss' ideas on continuous refraction, and refraction in air, water, glass objects. It is in chapter 16 that Voss recounts what he learned from examining a manuscript of Willebrord Snell and in chapter 18 that atmospheric refraction is considered. Chapters 24-28 are on color, which is presented as an entity separate from light, the intrinsic 'sulfurous quality' of an object. Chapters 29-32 cover various aspects of visual perception including the appearance of coronae, the apparent size of objects, what refraction does to solar and lunar observations, and refraction in general.||Voss adheres to image formation ideas from Witelo and Alhazen rather than those of ray propagation of Kepler, emphasizing the continuity of optical phenomena that take place throughout a transparent material, and not at (just) its surface. That is, Voss contends that light is continuously interacting with the transparent medium through which it travels, and so refraction is continuous, as appearances in some visual experiments seem to support.","‚ÅÇ A View from the Mountaintop: The Development of Isaac Vossius' Optics, 1658-1666|Dijksterhus, F.J.|In: <i>Isaac Vossius (1618-1689) between Science and Scholarship<i>, Brill, Leiden, 2012, pp 159-187.||De kleurtheorie van de Aristotelianen en de opvattingen van De la Chambre, Dulianiel en Vossius in de periode 1640-1670|MacLean, J.|<i>Scientiarum Historia<i>, Vol 10, 1968, pp 209-225.",****,Appendix Ad scriptum de nature et proprietate lucis,On a Letter Concerning the Nature and Properties of Light,1666,1650-1675,"Dutch scholar, linguist, libraian, and book collector on a grand scale.

"Tacquet, Andr√©",Andr√© Tacquet,,"Also Known As: Simone Lorenzo Veterani ",1612-1660,"Simone Lorenzo Veterani ",e,"Edited by Simone Lorenzo Veterani ",Opera Mathematica,"Posthumous editing and publication of a set of teaching manuals for the Jesuit schools. One, of 70 pages, is devoted to optics and, being practical rather than theoretical, uses geometrical-optics and experiments to present propositions on optics, perspective, projections for astrolabes, and the catoptrics of plane and curved mirrors. ","Andr√© Tacquet taught at the Flemish Jesuit school in Louvain from 1644 until his death in 1660. His <i>Elementa Euclidea Geometriae Planae et Solidae<i> of 1654 and <i>Arithmeticae Teor√≠a et Praxis<i> of 1656 were famous and tremendously successful textbooks; the <i>Elementa<i> saw more than 30 editions and was translated into English. This demonstrated success as a textbook writer had the Jesuit General Goswin Nickel request Tacquet to write a broader <i>cursus mathematicus<i> suitable for use in Jesuit schools. This meant an elementary exposition of Mixed Mathematics, used by a large number of beginning students, supporting the courses taught at Louvain and other Jesuit schools. Tacquet's response was to write an extensive series of teaching manuals covering arithmetic, geometry, statics, optics, astronomy and cosmography, ballistics, and military architecture. Of these only those on arithmetic and geometry were published in his lifetime; the others were unfinished. Some of these were, in turn, edited and assembled by Simon Laurent and published as the <i>Opera Mathematica<i>. He included Astronomy, Practical Geometry, Optics, and Catoptrics. Though Tacquet's text refers to a work on dioptrics, it was never found.||In keeping with his charge--and his own interests--Tacquet's approach to all aspects of Mixed Mathematics was practical and rarely ventured into theory. The geometric treatise on cyclinders and rings rejects Cavalieri's indivisibles--points make lines, lines make planes, planes make solids--for something more Archimedean: a method of exhaustion. Which led, via Blaise Pascal, to the development of infinitesimals. The treatise on astronomy--the largest by far, and probably the most complete at the time of Tacquet's death--presents but does not embrace Kepler's planetary elliptical orbits since he thought them as being of little practical  importance. For the same failure of practicality, he does not present arguments either for or against Copernican cosmography since he finds them merely statements of what is or is not probable.  Practicality is also the byword for the optics material.||An aspect of Tacquet‚Äôs pedagogical style is his unwillingness to present 'explanations' that he considers to be mere suppositions and not demonstrations. Another is his presentation of competing explanations but failure to discriminate between them or plump for one. These are seen in the treatise on astronomy and on optics.||A long summary and review of the <i>Opera Mathematica<i> appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Vol 3, No 43, January 1668. Editions appeared at Antwerp in 1668, 1699, and 1707.
","Tacquet's <i>Opera Mathematica<i> contains a treatise on astronomy in 8 books, a summary of practical geometry in 3 books, a treatise on optics in 3 books, a treatise on catoptrics in 3 books, and brief treatise on military architecture.  The first book of optics covers the appearance of things; that is, the nature of visual perception. Tacquet presents hypotheses that are actually what he considers to be statement of fact, followed by propositions that are presented as direct consequences. The result is an eclectic hybrid: light travels in straight lines, but objects 'project images that are captured by the eye' and produce perception. Position, size, and shape are governed by simple geometric optics and an appeal to the authority of Euclid, Alhazen, and Witelo. The appearance of circles, cones, and spheres (including the phases of the moon) from various view are described in this way. The second book of optics is on simple linear perspective, projection scenography, and anamorphosis. The third book of optics is on 'projective astronomy.' This covers dialling and the construction of astrolabes.||The first book of catoptrics covers basic reflection, presents the equal-angle law of reflection, its Cartesian and Witelian explanations, and its application to various mirrors. Tacquet believed the law of reflection could be also considered a consequence of a more general law: 'nature always acts along the shortest path.' The second book of catoptrics considers plane mirrors and their images. The third book of catoptrics considers curved mirrors and their images. This includes spherical parabolic, elliptical, and hyperbolic mirrors. Though its generality had been disproved by Kepler, Tacquet kept the 'Ancient Principle' of the cathetus for locating reflected images; a principle he considered 'the most fruitful in all of catoptrics', even though by his own experimentation he found cases involving spherical mirrors where it did not properly locate images.||Some of the Propositions involve experiments that range from simple, common visual observations to more elaborate investigations, particularly in optics. Physical optics is only touched upon, but the geometric optics is detailed, analytic, and accompanied by elaborate figures.","Jesuit Science in the Spanish Netherlands|Vanpaemel, G. H.

"Lass√®re, Michel OFM-CAP","Michel Lass√®re, OFM-CAP",Ch√©rubin d'Orl√©ans,Also Known As: Ch√©rubin d'Orl√©ans,1613-1697,,," ",La Dioptrique Oculaire,"The most exhaustive treatise on lens making in the 17th century. Comprehensive regarding the telescope, it includes microscopes, opera glasses, optical pantographs, and binocular instruments, all delt with from first-hand experience.
","The origins of Ch√©rubin d‚ÄôOrl√©ans‚Äôs <i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> are clear from his letter to the reader.  He was captivated by Galileo's <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i>, was inspired by the possibilities of optical instruments, and came to desire the approbation of the learned. He knew his own mathematical abilities and sought to study dioptrics. Later, he began his optical work, wanting to reduce theory of dioptrics to practice. That is, he would design and make optical instruments admired by natural philosophers. This desire is clear from the subtitle of the work: The Theory, The Practice, and The Mechanics of Oculars. Theory is used to envision instruments, their properties, and their function. Practice is used to design and make the dioptric parts of instruments. And Mechanics guides their actual construction.||Ch√©rubin worked on the dioptrics manuscript from 1665 to 1668 and which, presumably, Capuchin modesty kept him from publishing. But it was read by the bishop of Tulles, Louis de Rechignevoisin de Guron, who circulated it and received positive responses. Ch√©rubin was then sent to Paris to meet Guron's friends and have the work published. There, Ch√©rubin met Colbert, to whom he dedicated the work. The frontispiece half-title was drawn by Jean le Pautre and engraved by Gerard Edelinck.||In the 'Order and Plan of the Author', Ch√©rubin makes clear that his theory and principles come from his own experiments and those of Kepler, whom he 'found more to conform with his own findings'. Ch√©rubin follows Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> of 1611 very closely and draws from it extensively. Additionally, only his own experimentation and practice is reported; nothing is presented that he himself has not performed, examined, constructed, or practiced. This grounding in practice is an aspect of <i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> that made it so important to optical instrumentation in the late 17th century. Another important aspect was Ch√©rubin's insistence on the coupling of vision and optics; the best instruments would not result from considerations of light and lenses that excluded vison, and central to this was Ch√©rubin's commitment to idea of the superiority of binocular vision. Several binocular instruments are described.||Though microscopes are considered, <i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> is essentially a complete manual on telescope making. It is remarkable for its coverage: principles of telescope operation; lens design; principles for lenses spacing; lens grinding, figuring, and polishing; equipment necessary for lens working; proper lens apertures for best viewing; mechanical details of tubes, mountings, aiming, and instrument use; and a cataloguing of observations made with his instruments including selenography, sun spots, planetary observations, and comets. Ch√©rubin's manual was the most detailed, exhaustive treatment of lens making in the 17th century and was referenced and cited for more than 50 years. One of his lens lathes was taken up and perfected by the great Italian lens maker Giuseppe Campani. Ch√©rubin is cited in Robert Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738.
","<i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> is in three parts. Part 1, on the eye and vision, is in 5 sections, 52 pages. Section 1: The eye and vision in general. Sections 2 and 3: Direct Vision. Sections 4 and 5: Refracted Vision. Part 2, on refraction and the telescope, is in 12 sections, 110 pages. Sections 1 and 2: Refraction at spherical surfaces. Section 3: Convex lenses for telescopes of the first type. Section 4: Concave lenses and telescopes of the first type. Section 5: Convex and concave lenses and telescopes of the first type. Section 6: Convex lenses and telescopes of the second type. Section 7: Multiple lenses for telescopes of the second type. Section 8: Magnification of small objects. Section  9: Microscopes. Section 10: Catadioptric telescopes using reflection and refraction. Section 11: Binocular telescopes. Section 12: Lens design and specification. Part 3-Practice, on the construction and use of telescopes and microscopes, is in 12 Sections, 173 pages. Part 3-Mechanics, on lens making, equipment, and mechanics, is in 6 sections, 75 pages. Section 1: Lens forming, grinding, and polishing by hand. Section 2: Lens forming, grinding, and polishing with a 'guided' hand. Section 3: Lens forming, grinding, and polishing by simple machines. Section 4: Lenses by machines guided by hand. Section 5: Making accurate concave lenses. Section 6: A universal method for spherical surfaces.||Part 1 presents the optical properties of the main parts of the eye and their function, following Kepler. This is supplemented with material from Christopher Scheiner‚Äôs <i>Oculus<i> of 1619 and <i>Rosa Ursina<i> of 1632.||Part 2 presents the theory of telescopes. Lens analysis is based on Kepler's approximate law of refraction. Foci for convex, concave, biconvex, biconcave, and meniscus lenses are given, and Kepler's result for the interaction of two convex lenses is extended and used to consider Keplerian telescopes with up to 5 lenses. Ch√©rubin labels Galilean and Keplerian telescopes the first and second type, respectively. Part 2 also presents the analysis of multiple lens microscopes. In general, Part 2 builds on and extends the theory of lenses in Kepler's Dioptrice, with analysis limited to paraxial rays.||The first section of Part 3 presents the use of optical instruments and reports the observations Ch√©rubin made with them, including sun spot projection and lunar mapping.||The second section of Part 3 presents lens making. Cherubin gives (and used) three ways of making lenses: with a 'free and flowing hand' using only handcraft, with a 'constrained but flowing hand' using a mechanical tool, and with 'a machine that guides the hand.' such as with a lathe. The level of elaboration and detail in this Part is remarkable, covering every aspect of glass preparation, grinding, polishing materials and methods, mould use, and elaborate drawings and instructions for lathes and other tools.||The material clearly reflects Ch√©rubin's experience in lens making. He does not believe that a good lens can be made by machine alone--some handcraft is always required--and scoffs at the 'speculative mechanizers' struggling to make lenses of hyperbolic figure, citing the difficulty in just working with spherical surfaces.","<i>Descartes and the hyperbolic quest: Lens making machines and their significance in the seventeenth century<i>|Burnett, D.G.|American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 2005, pp 107‚Äì121.||Kepler's legacy: Telescopes and geometrical optics, 1611-1669|Malet, A.|In: <i>The Origins of the Telescope<i>, KNAW Press, Amsterdam, 2010, pp 281-300.||<i>Scientific Instruments of the 17th & 18th Centuries and their Makers<i>|Daumas, M.|Holbrook, M., translator|Portman, London, 1989.||<i>Prism and Lens Making<i>|Tyman, F.|Adam Hilger, London, 1942, pp. 1-10.||Lens Making for Scientific Instrumentation in the Seventeenth Century|Bedini, S.A.|<i>Applied Optics<i>, Vol 5, No 5, 1966, pp 687-694.||<i>The Quest for Perfect Vision: Ch√©rubin d‚ÄôOrl√©ans‚Äôs Optical Instruments and the Development of Theories of Binocular Perception in Late Seventeenth-Century France<i>|Gallay, A.|Mphil Dissertation, University of Cambridge, 2013, 34 p.",****,"La Dioptrique Oculaire, ou La Theorique, La Positive, et La Mechanqiue, de L'Oculaire Dioptrique en toutes ses Especes.","The Dioptric Ocular, or the Theory, Practice, and Mechanics of the Dioptric Ocular in all its Forms.",1671,1650-1675,"French Capuchin, oculist, teacher.

"Barrow, Isaac",Isaac Barrow,," ",1630-1677,,," ",Lectiones optic√¶ & Geometric√¶,Elaborate development of the theory of optical images. Includes preliminaries on the nature of light and color and a full mathematical treatment of images formed by mirrors and lenses.,"Isaac Barrow's optics work has its origin in his growing interest in natural philosophy while studying at Cambridge and was expressed in his thesis on the insufficiency of Descartes' geometrical optics--that is, the shortcomings of the mechanical basis for optics. Continental Cartesianism had evolved elaborate mechanical models for light's rectilinear propagation, reflection, refraction, and double refraction; all deduced from a mechanical model of light's nature. Though Barrow considered it necessary to present the briefest summaries of these theories in his lectures, he considered them all hypothetical and inconsequential, since, regarding light's nature, 'proofs cannot be given.' Thus, aside from some material in the first two <i>lectiones<i>, Barrow does not deal with the nature of light. His lectures deal narrowly but completely with optical images, their formation, their size, their placement.||The optical lectures were developed between 1664 and 1669, fulfilling the requirement of the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics, to which Barrow had been appointed in 1663. In 1669 Barrow resigned the Lucasian Chair in favor of Isaac Newton and would have left the lectures unpublished, but John Collins, fellow mathematician, urged him to publish, to which he finally agreed. The work of seeing a manuscript through the press was left to Collins and Isaac Newton. In was in this way that Newton edited and corrected Barrow's lectures for print. The <i>Lectiones Opticae<i> presented a modern theory of images in spherical mirrors and lenses, the location of focal points including those for thick lenses, and a derivation of the radius of the rainbow.||The audience for Barrow's Lectures was small--the mathematics presented was daunting for all but the very learned. Within its small audience, the Lectures were well received. They formed the most advanced treatise on geometrical optics then available and would form the basis and beginning point for Newton's own, later Optical Lectures. References to Barrow's <i>Lectiones Opticae<i> were later made and some of its developments used by Christiaan Huygens, Jakob Bernoulli, David Gregory, Jean-√âtienne Montucla, and Robert Smith.||Barrow's <i>Lectiones Opticae<i> appeared at London in 1669, and again together with the <i>Lectiones Geometricae<i> in 1674, edited by Whewell in 1860, and a translation into English appeared in 1987.
","Barrow's elaborate development of the the theory of optical images is presented in 18 Lectures.  1: Nature and propagation of light. 2: Laws of reflection and refraction. 3: Application of the laws. 4 & 5: Refraction at a plane surfaces. 6 & 7: Reflection at spherical surfaces. 8 & 9: Reflection at convex spherical surfaces. 10: Reflection at concave spherical surfaces. 11 , 12, & 13: Refraction at spherical surfaces. 14: Thick lenses. 15: Images of extended objects. 16: Images of line objects. 17: Curvature of images of lines. 18: Images of line objects by refraction at spherical surfaces.||In lectures 1-3 Barrow presents a hybrid theory of light that combines corpuscular emission with mediumistic pulses, giving him six hypotheses or axioms on which he based his geometric optics: linear propagation, emission from every point on a luminous surface, normal incidence is a special case for reflection and refraction, reflected and refracted rays are coplanar with the incident ray and surface normal, equal angle law of reflection, and sine law of refraction. Barrow invokes 'ray fronts' of Thomas Hobbes, as used by Emanuel Maignan, to derive the laws of reflection and refraction. The heart of the material is in lectures 4-13. He first presents what came to be known as 'Barrow's Principal for Image Location': an image is located at that place from which rays entering the eye appear to diverge. He then establishes his new and fundamental analysis tool: the oblique pencil of rays. With these tools, and often elaborate geometrical analysis, Barrow establishes methods for determining image locations produced by mirrors and refactors with the eye both on and off the optical axis. This allows him to determine the image point after any collection of reflections and refractions at plane and spherical surfaces. All this, in turn, is applied to lenses and focal points and image locations for single or multiple thin and thick lenses. The same method is used in a derivation of the primary rainbow radius and an elegant solution to Alhazen's Problem.||The analysis throughout is detailed, elaborately geometrical, and tediously complete.","‚ÅÇ The Optical Lectures and the Foundations of the Theory of Optical Imagery|Shapiro, A.E.|In: <i>Before Newton: the Life and Times of Isaac Barrow<i>, Feingold M., editor|Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990, pp 105-178.||ùëª <i>Isaac Barrow's Optical Lectures<i>|Fay, H.C. translator, Bennet, A.G., editor|The Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers, London, 1987, 243 pp.||The Works of Isaac Barrow|Hill, A.|Riker, New York, 1845, Vol 1, 628 pp, NB: xxxix-xli.",****,"Archimedis Opera: Apollonii Pergaei Conicorum Libri IIII.

","At the end of his preface to the first French edition of the <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> 1671, Jacques Rohault mentions that he was 'preparing a Latin version in favor of foreigners, in whom I dare promise myself a fairly favorable reception.' But Rohault never publish a Latin translation. The first was this very close translation produced by the Geneva physician TheÃÅophile Bonet which appeared at Geneva in 1674 (this edition). It was reprinted at London and Amsterdam in 1682, at Amsterdam in 1691 and 1700 and at London in 1691 with notes by the Franciscan Antoine Le Grand, at Amsterdam in 1708 and Cologne in 1713 with notes by both Le Grand and Samuel Clarke. For use at English universities, Clarke made a second Latin translation that appeared at London in 1697 and preprinted in 1702, 1710, and 1718. It was into these editions of his Latin translation of Rohault that Clarke added every more numerous and lengthy notes, augmenting, supplanting, and eclipsing Cartesianism with Newtonianism.
","Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> is in four parts. Part 1 is in 35 chapters and covers principles of physics, nature of matter, motion and its analysis, forms of matter, heat and cold, the senses of taste, smell, and hearing, and finally the eye, optics, and vision. The Cartesian principles of extension, divisibility, motion, and rest are used to deduce general laws of statics, dynamics, and--via ballistic conceptions  of reflection and refraction--optics. Part 2 is in 29 chapters and covers cosmography, astronomy, selenography, the planets and their movements, the fixed stars, and finally the competing theories of the sun and planets. Rohault plumps for the Copernican as the most rational. Part 3 is in 17 chapters and covers geology in general, including the Earth and things that are part of it, such as the atmosphere, the seas, metals and minerals, fountains, winds, fogs and clouds, rain and hail, snow and frosts, lighting, and finally the rainbow. Part 4 is in 26 chapters and covers anatomy, muscles and movement, blood and circulation, digestion and breathing, and finally maladies and disease.||The optics material covers 115 pages and though patterned closely after Descartes' essay La Dioptrique, it is fully empirical with experiments, demonstrations, and observations reported to test theory and hypothesis. The topics include: the nature of light, color, transparency and opacity. Direct, reflected, and refracted light are demonstrated as well as the simpler forms of image formation by mirrors and lenses. Descartes theory of vision is presented in full. All the optical topics are treated in an elementary but thorough manner. Thus, for example, the focusing properties of spherical convex lenses are demonstrated, but nothing is said of spherical aberration.||Experiment receives a double role: on the one hand, it is shown how it discriminates between conjectures pointing to the ones that are empirically confirmed; on the other hand, it is a powerful pedagogical tool that can convince the reader of explanations given and laws stated.","Rohault's Cartesian Physics|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Cartesian Empiricisms<i>, Springer, 2013, pp 203-226.||Rohault's Traite de Physique and its Newtonian Reception|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Proceedings of the 4th International Conference of the ESHS<i>, 2010, pp 389-394.||The experimental physics of Jacques Rohault|Spink A.|<i>British Journal for the History of Philosophy<i>, Vol 26, No 5, 2017, pp 850-870.||The Study of Early Scientific Textbooks|Sarton, G.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 38, No 3/4, 1948, pp 137-148.||Motion and God in XVIIth Century Cartesian manuals: Rohault, R√©gis and Gadroys|Milani, N.E.|<i>Noctua<i> Vol 2, Nos.1-2, 2015, pp 481-516.",****,Jacobi Rohaulti Tractatus Physicus.

Experiments are presented to show the superiority of binocular vision and the resulting requirements for instruments. Methods for the design, construction, testing, and use of binocular microscopes, telescopes, 'binoculars', and spectacles are given.
","In his <i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> of 1671, Ch√©rubin d'Orl√©ans noted the inferiority of monocular vision and refuted the notion that it is more natural and efficacious to use one eye. Aside from questions of stereoscopy, he considered binocular vision superior: with both eyes open, the pupils are larger and 'more rays enter the humors of the eye'--though he does admit that vision is more distinct with one eye. In his Preface to <i>La Vision Parfaite<i>, Ch√©rubin continue to insist that vision is more powerful when both eyes are used, and that to this end binocular optical instruments need to permit the visual axes of the two eyes to converge to a single point on the viewed object, rather than be parallel. He also states in the Preface that he had resolved to make a binocular microscope and because he had succeeded beyond his expectations, he had 'determined to make it the principal subject of the present work.'  <i>La Vision Parfaite<i> describes the first binocular microscope and though it never explicitly considers the potential for stereopsis that binocular vision affords, sections of the book would later be cited by Robert Smith in his <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738 in this regard and by Charles Wheatstone in his work on stereoscopic pictures in 1853. <i>La Vision Parfaite<i> had a reception that ranged from politely cool to antagonistic and prompted Ch√©rubin to write a second part, defending his ideas.||The first part of <i>La Vision Parfaite<i> appeared in 1677. A Latin rendition of the French text of the first part appeared in 1678. A second part appeared in 1681.
","<i>La Vision Parfaite<i> is in four parts. Part 1, by far the longest, is in three sections. Section 1 presents a theory of binocular vision, emphasizing the convergent optical axes of the two eyes. This is followed by descriptions of five experiments with results that support the theory. Section 2 presents refutations of opinions and ideas opposed to the binocular theory, including: parallel optical axes, dominance of one eye, and alternating suppression. Finally, a consideration of why previous binocular systems with parallel axes fail, and what principles are required for proper binocular instruments. Section 3 details the requirements for a binocular telescope, including the optical and mechanical features that are required.   A consideration of binocular vision and optical instruments. Experiments are presented to show the superiority of binocular vision and the resulting requirements for instruments. Methods for the design, construction, testing, and use of binocular microscopes, telescopes, 'binoculars', and spectacles are given.||Part 2 is in two sections. Section 1 is a detailed description of the construction of a binocular microscope including the optical and mechanical components. Section 2 describes the construction of what would now be called binoculars. Part 3 is in three sections. Section 1 describes the construction of spectacles based on the binocular theory of vision. Sections 2 and 3 consider some of the visual effects of binocular vision. Part 4 is in two sections. Section 1 is a manual for the design and construction of the lenses required for  binocular optical systems. Section 2 describes a binocular drawing machine for use by artists.","<i>The Quest for Perfect Vision<i>|Gallay, A.|Dissertation|University of Cambridge, 2013, 34 p.||The disparate histories of binocular vision and binaural hearing|Wade, N.J.|<i>Journal of the History of the Neurosciences<i>, Vol 27, No 1, 2018, pp 10‚Äì35.",****,La Vision Parfaite: ou Le Concours Des Deux Axes de la Vision en un seul point de l'object.,"Perfect Vision: or, The Convergence of the Two Axes of Vision on a Single Point of An Object.",1677,1675-1700,"French Capuchin, oculist, teacher.

It then seems likely that  Abraham Woodhead of University College was attracted to the subject and some of Cooper's ideas and so reviewed and prepared the manuscript which was left at his death. Obadiah Walker likely found the manuscript among Woodhead's papers and, as he did with several other of Woodhead's works, saw it through the press with 500 copies printed.","There are 51 experiments and demonstrations, accompanied by explanations; 41 devoted to convex lenses, 10 devoted to concave lenses. These are followed by considerations of image position. The language is idiosyncratic: 'glass' is used rather than 'lens'; 'prospective' rather than 'telescope'; 'conical' and 'circumferential' rays rather than 'convergent' and 'divergent'. After a brief, qualitative consideration of refraction, the analysis considers convex lenses: their focal points, operation of multiple lenses, and generation of images. Though the analysis is detailed, it is not mathematical, with geometry invoked only occasionally, and the results expressed descriptively but very concisely. The whole work having the format of a laboratory note book or journal and not a finished treatise--a technical brown study, as it were.

Disputations are presented which consider the old and new views of Aristotle, Gassendi, and Descartes.","Du Hamel's <i>Philosophia Vetus Et Nova<i> has its origins in the general course he taught at the Coll√©ge du Plessis in the 1660s and 1670s. By the late 1670s, the alarm caused by the rise of the teaching of Cartesian mechanical philosophy in France prompted church, school, and king to attempt to stem the tide. French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert ordered DuHamel's course material to be published as a textbook for colleges. It would be widely used for 25 years. Though generally a reactionary, DuHamel's work in natural philosophy was characterized by accommodation of old and new ideas, producing a mix of the Peripatetic and the Cartesian. Thus, De Hamel's text presents modern natural philosophical phenomena and concepts supported by an eclectic blur of Descartes' mechanical analogies and metaphysics, and Scholastic forms and distinctions. For many of the details regarding phenomena and concepts, Du Hamel refers the reader to Jacques Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i>.||Published in four volumes, the <i>Philosophia Vetus Et Nova<i> was a universal course in philosophy covering logic, metaphysics, moral philosophy, and general and special physics. All material is presented in the form of disputations.||Editions appeared at Paris in 1678, 1681, 1682, 1684, 1687, at Nuremburg in 1682, at London in 1685, at Amsterdam in 1700, and at Venice in 1704, 1730, 1736. This edition of 1682 is a reprinting of the first of 1678.
","<i>Philosophia Vetus Et Nova<i> is in four volumes. Vol 1 covers logic, metaphysics; Vol 2 covers moral philosophy; Vol 3 covers general physics; Vol 4 covers special physics. All material is presented in the form of disputations. Special Physics is in three parts, Part 1: The Earth and the Heavens covered in 3 Tracts; Part 2: On Living Bodies and the Senses including meteorics and the rainbow covered in 4 Tracts; Part 3: Animate objects and senses covered in 3 Tracts.||The rainbow is described in Chapter 11, Tract 2, Part 1. After a brief consideration of the nature of refraction, the explanations of Descartes and Mariotte of the rainbow are given, with light refracted by and reflected in rain drops and color resulting from light mixing and interacting with water. Vision is described in Chapters 5-7, Dissertation 3, Tract 1, Part 3. The ocular anatomy is from Christoph Scheiner and the visual process from Descartes. Finally, aspects of perception are considered, including perceptions of distance and size. Optics and the nature of light is described in Chapters 5-10, Dissertation 4 of Tract 1, Part 3. The nature of light is described in Scholastic terms, including the transmission of visual species. Reflected light is treated with Euclidian geometry and refracted light with Descartes' ideas and used to describe the action of lenses. Rays are traced through lenses to show how telescopes and microscopes produced magnified images. Finally, some color phenomena are presented from Mariotte's and Boyle's books on the subject. Color is described as disturbed or mixed light, having interacted with water or glass. In all cases, the treatment is elementary but thorough and contemporary, and is often a hybrid of Aristotle, Gassendi, and Descartes.","The Moment of No Return: The University of Paris and the Death of Aristotelianism|Brockliss, L.|<i>Science & Education<i>, Vol 15 No 2-4,  2006, pp 259‚Äì278.",****,"Philosophia Vetus Et Nova.

"Dechales, Claude Francois Milliet SJ","Claude Francois Milliet Dechales, SJ",," ",1621-1678,,," ",Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus,"Second edition of the <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> of 1674; a complete course of Mixed Mathematics expressly meant for teaching, it became a popular, widely-used textbook.
","The origin of Dechales' <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> was his long experience in teaching Mixed Mathematics, from which he had acquired not only an understanding of the audience for such material but also skill in its presentation. In his Preface, Dechales gives the reason for writing the <i>Cursus<i>: He wanted to produce a work for young students that would be used for self-study, that did not presume a previous knowledge of mathematics, and from which they could learn without the need for a teacher or guide. Dechales' purpose informs the content, style, and order of the work. Most of what he considered necessary in mathematics is presented in the first 400 pages of Tome I. In the rest of the work, geometry and the laws of proportions are used most often, along with a little trigonometry. The presentations are clear, sufficiently detailed, and often accompanied by figures which, though relatively simple wood-cuts, are important to the material. No derivations are given, only statements of results or facts, and though advancing no novelties of his own, Deschales exercises considerable discernment, presenting what he held to be the best of the then-current theories and formulations of the topics covered. He presents (and defends), for example, Galileo‚Äôs theory of motion, but generally rejects Cartesianism.||The second, posthumous edition was overseen by Father Aim√© Varcin, who has been entrusted by Dechales' brother to bring the Cursus back into print. Among the papers in Dechales' estate was an incomplete draft of a history of mathematics. Varcin reworked this and it appears as the 108-page Tractatus Proemialis at the start of Volume 1 of the second edition. Apart from some small additions by Varcin, the second edition is essentially a reprinting of the first, using the same wood blocks for the figures.||That the work was entirely self-contained and gave presentations of great clarity helped make it popular and widely used. It was, for example, still used as a textbook at the University of Upsala early in the 18th century.||Dechales' <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> was reviewed--in the form of a summary--in the Transactions of the Royal Society in Vol 9, No 110, Jan 1675, pp 229-233. Editions appeared 1674 and posthumously, slightly expanded to 4 volumes, in 1690.
","A complete course of Mixed Mathematics expressly meant for self-study and as an aid to teaching. It covers practical geometry, arithmetic, plane and spherical trigonometry, mechanics, statics, geography, magnetism, military architecture, hydrostatics and fountains, optics, music, pyrotechnics, astrolabes, dialling, astronomy, calendars, algebra, method of indivisibles, and conic sections.||Optics takes up 385 pages of volume 2, presenting Tracts 18-21 covering Optics, Perspective, Catoptrics, Dioptrics, and lastly a Mechanical Digression. The Optics tract is in three books: Suppositions and Vision; Binocular vision; Propagation of Light. The Perspective tract is in six books: Fundamentals; Iconographic projection; Sceneographics; Aspects of linear perspective. The Catoptrics tract is in four books: Plane mirrors; Convex mirrors; Concave mirrors; Cylindrical mirrors. The Dioptrics tract is in two books: Refraction and individual lenses; Combined lenses. The Mechanical Digression covers image locations, refracted colors, and aspects of meteorological phenomena.||The material includes: The eye's structure and function, monocular and binocular vision; the nature, propagation, reflection, and refraction of light; plain and curved mirrors and the images they produce, lenses and multiple lenses and the magnified images they produce; the operation of microscopes and telescopes. Dechales deals only briefly with physical optics, giving reasons for reflection and refraction, and most often in very short sections titled 'Digressio Physica.'  Most of the material is geometric optics and the fundamental quantity is the luminous ray. Dechales gives a competent overview of geometrical optics and images but never presents anything as densely mathematical as Barrow's Optical Lectures. However circumscribed by the intended purpose and audience, Dechales' presentations are remarkably clear, and along the way he introduces the term 'virtual image' as companion to 'real image' and so clarifies the physical meaning of image, uses pencils of rays to qualitatively analyze the position and size of images in lensed optical systems, and accurately describes the operation of the magic lantern.||Though dependent on many sources for his material, Dechales rarely cites them. Dechales' optical material includes some that comes from uncited works by Christoph Scheiner, Bonaventura Cavalieri, Gilles Personne de Roberval, James Gregory, and Francesco Eschinardi.","Images: Real and Virtual, Projected and Perceived, from Kepler to Dechales|Shapiro, A.E.|In: <i>Inside the Camera Obscura ‚Äì Optics and Art under the Spell of the Projected Image<i>|Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Preprint 333, 2007, pp 75-95.||<i>A Philosophical and Mathematical Dictiionary<i>|Hutton, C.|London, 1815, Vol I, pp 395-396.",****,"R.P.

The section 'Optica,' though elementary, is detailed and elaborately geometric.
","Ozanam declares in his Preface his reason for writing the dictionary: Mathematics and the sciences had advance to such an extent, and their application to many aspects of commercial, intellectual, and military life was so extensive, that a general dictionary of terms and concepts was necessary. He makes it clear that the work is the compilation of a dictionary of the term of Mixed Mathematics. It contained definitions from algebra and geometry in addition to general notions of the disciplines which are founded on mathematics, such as naval architecture and music. It ends with an index which allows for the dictionary to be used for consultation, placing it in the tradition of scientific dictionaries. Ozanam's dictionary was acknowledged by Harris in his <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> of 1704. Editions appear at Paris and Amsterdam in 1691, and an English translation and abridgement by Joseph Raphson appeared at London in 1702.
","The <i>Dictionnaire Mathematique<i> is a collection of long, descriptive essays containing definitions of terms and solved problems in a wide range of subjects in Mixed Mathematics. The section 'Optica' (50 pages) includes: optics, perspective, gnomics, reflection, and refraction. The treatment, though elementary, is detailed and elaborately geometric. Each section begins with terms and their definitions, followed by exemplifying problems. The demonstrations and proofs for the problems are particularly clear, with highly detailed and careful diagrams. The sections on optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics reference and follow Pierre Rohault's textbook. Each of these sections ends with several problems, nominally involving the topic at hand, but which are elaborate demonstrations of the use of mathematics.","Jacques Ozanam (1640‚Äì1718)|C√†ndito, C.|In: <i>Distinguished Figures in Descriptive Geometry and Its Applications for Mechanism Science: From the Middle Ages to the 17th Century<i>|Springer, 2016, 248 pp, pp 223-248.",****,"Dictionnaire mathematique, ou, IdeÃÅe generale des mathematiques.

He wrote this work at the end of his long career, writing in his Preface that ""I have shaken off the yoke of school and am not subject to the words of teachers,"" and so he had time to write.
","Volume 1 contains Logic, Volume 2 contains Metaphysics, and Volumes 3-5 are devoted to Physics. Volume three is in three tracts: On the vegetative soul in 12 chapters, On the sensitive soul in 49 chapters, and On the rational soul in 6 chapters. The material on the eye, color and vision occupy chapters 25-29 (30 pages) of the second tract. The anatomy of the eye is essentially Galenic, with the lens placed in the center of the eye surrounded by spherical tunics.  The only influence of Plater and Kepler is the account of the retina as the receiver of light. Visual spirit is brought from the brain. The material on Color is classical, with no influence of Descartes or Newton, and is considered a separate entity from light but like it, radiated from objects to be received by the eye. The last two chapters deal with vision and its function. Vision is defined to be motion of animal spirit to the brain from the retina, having been impressed by rays entering the eye from the viewed object. Direct and reflected vision are briefly considered, as is the manner in which two eyes generate a single perceived object.||The presentation is entirely descriptive and is in the form of Scholastic Disputation, with point, counter-point, objections, and resolutions.","Dictionnaire Historique Biographique et Bibliographique|Barjavel, C.-F.-H.|Tome Premier, A-F|Capentras, 1841, 591 pp, NB: pp 60-61.",****,"Antiqua priscorum hominum philosophia, evidentibus demonstrationibus.

"Hartsoeker, Nicolaas",Nicolaas Hartsoeker,," ",1656-1725," A. Block",,Edited by  A. Block,Proeve der deurzicht-kunde,"Ameldonck Block's Dutch translation of Nicolaas Hartsoeker's <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> of 1694. The last chapter include reports of Hartsoeker's extensive observations with a microscope of his own construction, including his famed description of spermatozoa.
","Hartsoeker's <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> is his first publication and the culmination of 20 years of lens grinding and instrument making, including not only time as an independent craftsman but also his years working in the Paris observatory. It is also the first expression of his developing work in natural philosophy. Hartsoeker was living in Paris at the time he wrote <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> and had acquired a European reputation for lens-craft and instrument making. Unlike most other European lens makers, Hartsoeker made no secret of his craft and the <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> gives long, detailed descriptions of all aspects of lens making. Beyond the technical details of lens-craft, he includes his notions regarding the nature of light and the reasons for and processes of reflection and refraction, and his telescopic and microscopic observations and their interpretation. Given the range of material covered, the work's title is, perhaps, too diminutive.||Hartsoeker's treatment of technical details is thoroughly mathematical, written in the style of textbook, and his practical and mechanical descriptions are informed by his long and deep experience. His natural philosophy is significantly more speculative and, particularly when interpreting his own telescopic and microscopic observations, opened a door for considerable criticism. The interpretations he gave to some of his microscopical observations were influenced by 'animalculist' beliefs. It is in this regard that he makes his famous conjecture, provided with an accompanying and equally famous figure, that a tiny, preformed human resides in a spermatozoon.||This Dutch translation appeared at Amsterdam in 1699. The translator provided his own Preface and explains that Hartsoeker's book is so 'lucid, veracious, and judicious' that he translated it for those wishing to learn lens-craft who did not read Latin or French. The¬†cover illustration by Jan Luykens; an engraving by Jan Goeree shows Hartsoeker‚Äôs long telescope with a wooden tube, hoisted on a mast. To the left side is another tubeless telescope with the objective lens being hoisted onto the mast of the large wooden telescope.
","The <i>Essay Dioptrique<i> contains 10 chapters. Chapter 1: nature and origin of light rays. Chapter 2: opaque and transparent bodies. Chapter 3: rectilinear light rays. Chapter 4: on reflection and refraction. Chapter 5: the radiant point. Chapter 6: the eye. Chapter 7: vision. Chapter 8: making glass lenses. Chapter 9: proper use of lenses. Chapter 10: observations made with telescopes and microscopes||Hartsoeker considers light a fiery liquid, one of the two substances that make up all matter. Opaque or transparent bodies are made up of the second substance; its particulate arrangement allowing, or not, the passage of light at a finite speed that depends on the body's density. Mechanical forces are invoked to explain reflection and refraction, and these same forces, varying with different rays, cause different colors as 'they strike the organ of vision.' Color are produced by the interaction of rays with materials, culling some rays, enhancing others; thus the color appearance of objects. The material on ocular anatomy is contemporary and that on vision is Keplerian.||The material on lens making is very detailed and includes: the proper chemical composition of glass; glass forming and its difficulties; glass types; grinding, figuring, polishing, and testing lenses. Hartsoeker describes grinding lenses in metal forms, rather than turning on a lathe. The construction of spectacles, telescopes, and microscopes are also described in detail, including examples of the calculations necessary to determine lens radii, spacing, and size. The last chapter include reports of Hartsoeker's extensive observations with a microscope of his own construction, including his famed description of spermatozoa.","The Natural Philosopher and the Microscope: Nicolas Hartsoeker Unravels Nature's 'Admirable ≈íconomy'|Abou-Nemeh, S.C.|<i>History of Science<i>,Vol 51, No 1, 2013, pp 1-32.||Images and Ideas: Leeuwenhoek's Perception of the Spermatozoa|Ruestow, E.G.|<i>Journal of the History of Biology<i>, Vol 16, No 2, 1983, pp 185-224.||Constructive thinking: a case for dioptrics|Dijksterhuis, F.J.|In: <i>The Mindful Hand: Inquiry and Invention from the late Renaissance to Early Industrialization<i>|Koninkliijke, Amsterdam, 2007, 468 pp, pp 59-82.||<i>A Certain Instrument to See Far: Four Centuries of Styling the Telescope Illustrated by a Selection of Treasures from the Louwman Collection of Historic Telescopes<i>|Louwman, P.J.K., Zuidervaart, H.J.|Wassenaar, 2013, 256 p.",****,"Proeve der deurzicht-kunde, in het Frans beschreeven van de Heer Nicolaas Hartsoeker, en vertaald door A.

","A brief text on the measurement of light, arising in part, from the need to be able to produce reliable ratios of different amounts of light. At the start of the 18th century there were instruments that made it possible to determine such ratios of temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure; but not for light. Jean Fran√ßois-Marie describes a simple way to make such a determination, using attenuation to extinction.

","In his 'From the Author to the Reader', Jean Fran√ßois-Marie describes in the utility and importance of the thermometer, barometer, and the hygrometer for measuring temperature, pressure, and humidity.

The instrument is an opaque tube through which a source is viewed. Multiple glass plates are placed in the tube until the source cannot be seen.

"Huygens, Christian",Christian Huygens,," ",1629-1695,"Burchard de Volder, Bernard Fullenius",e,"Edited by Burchard de Volder, Bernard Fullenius",Opuscula postuma,"A printing of edited manuscripts left by Huygens after his death including, most importantly, the Dioptrica. The collection also includes Huygens' commentaries on figuring and polishing lenses, a dissertation on coronae and parahelia, tracts on motion and centrifugal force, and a description of Huygens' planetarium or orrery.","When Christiaan Huygens died in 1695, he bequeathed to the University of Leiden his workbooks, papers, and letters. In his will he requested that Bernard Fullenius Jr (friend and government official) and Burchard de Volder (famed natural philosopher at the University of Leiden) prepare for publication the manuscripts of his Dioptrics, his Laws of Percussion, his Dutch treatise on lenses, and anything else that they felt worth printing. Fullenius and de Volder acted as editors and produced the <i>Opuscula Postuma<i> of 1703. The editors invoked the help of 'curators and councilors' whom they list before their own Preface.||Unlike the other the material, the manuscript for the <i>Dioptrica<i> was in a state ready for publishing at the time of Huygens' death. He had worked on it nearly constantly for more than 30 years; always promising to publish but never doing so. He had carefully ordered and numbered the pages, had them copied, and personally corrected the copy. There was little for the editors to do but see the manuscript through the press.||Unlike the Trait√© de la Lumi√®re, his later work which was narrowly concerned with the nature and propagation of light, the <i>Dioptrica<i> dealt only with mathematical geometrical optics, practical lens craft, and optical instruments. The first part of the <i>Dioptrica<i> dates from around 1652 and contains Huygens earliest work on refraction and lenses. The second part which deals with spherical aberration dates from around 1665. This section was considerably revised when Huygens read of Newton's discovery of chromatic dispersion in 1672. The third part on telescopes and microscopes was written 1685.||The influence of the <i>Opuscula Postuma<i> was limited, since many of the most striking advances that Huygens had made and recorded in the <i>Dioptrica<i> had subsequently been made by others and published earlier. This was the case with both Isaac Barrow in his <i>Lectiones Optic√¶<i> of 1674 and William Molyneux in his <i>Dioptrica Nova<i> of 1692. However superseded its content may have been  by the time it was published, the <i>Dioptrica<i> revealed the workings of one of the 17th century's most singular talent in optics. Interestingly, the anonymous editor of Isaac Newton's <i>Optical Lectures<i> of 1729 claimed that the appearance of Huygens's <i>Dioptrica<i> in the <i>Opuscula Postuma<i> in 1703 was one of the factors that overcame Newton's famed refractory reluctance to publish his Opticks--which finally appeared in 1704. A second edition of the <i>Opus Postuma<i> appeared in 1728.
","Huygens' <i>Dioptrica<i> is in three parts. The first is a tract on refraction and the telescope, the Tractatus de Refractione et Telescopiis; the second is on spherical aberration, the De Aberratione Radiorum a Foco; and the third on practical telescopes and microscopes, the De Telescopiis et Microscopiis. The <i>Dioptrica<i> contains much original work. In the first part Huygens uses the sine law of refraction to establish fundamental characteristics of lens imaging for paraxial rays. In the same part, and more importantly, he derives his theorem on the unchanged image formed by a system of lenses when the eye and object are interchanged. This theorem was a great analytic power and would later be (re)discovered by Smith and presented in his <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738.||In the second part, Huygens presents his theorem and practical embodiment of a lens doublet which overcomes spherical aberration using only spherical figures. In the third part, telescope magnification is shown to be the ratio of object-to-ocular focal lengths. This section also contains considerable material on physiological optics, the efficacious functioning of telescopes and microscopes, and describes a 'simplified eye': the eye modeled with concentric hemispheres of different radii. The Dioptrica and Huygens work on meteorological optics of coronas and halos take 370 of the collection's 430 pages.","Some of Huygens‚Äô Contributions to Dioptrics, with Notes|Southall, J.P.C.|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i>, Vol 6, No 5, 1922, pp. 461-475.||<i>Lenses and Waves<i>|Dijksterhuis, F.J.|Kluwer, 2004, pp 213-253.||Christiaan Huygens' great treasure|Yoder, J.G.|<i>Tractrix<i>, 3, 1991, pp 1-13.||Huygens's Dioptrica|Jan Dijksterhuis, F.J.|<i>De zeventiende eeuw<i>, Vol 12, No 1, 1996, pp 117-127.||<i>Christiaan Huygens, Oeuvres compl√®tes.

"Harris, John",John Harris,," ",1666-1710,,," ",Lexicon Technicum,"An encyclopedic dictionary that briefly defines words or describes concepts in what ranges from single sentences to essays. The emphasis is on mathematics and science.
","John Harris, Secretary of the Royal Society from 1709, was the first lexicographer to distinguish between a word-book, that is a dictionary, and a subject-book, that is, an encyclopedia. Harris' work is a hybrid, with entries varying in length from those typical of dictionaries to those of encyclopedias. It is also the first English encyclopedia presenting entries in alphabetical order. In his Preface, Harris makes clear his intention to provide a reference work of high utility, focusing on the 'arts and sciences' and to do more than just explain words, he wanted to explain the arts themselves. Harris's work was focused primarily on the mathematical sciences and their application. This emphasis was due, in part, to Harris's own background, the contributors he managed to assemble, and what he felt was missing in existing dictionaries. This content gave the work a unique and general appeal and, as Harris hoped, the reader would find the book 'useful to be read carefully over, as well as to be consulted like other Dictionaries occasionally.'||A review of the work, extending to the unusual length of four pages, appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1704. The <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> was long very popular, enduring through at least 1744 as the main rival of Ephraim Chambers's <i>Cyclopaedia<i>. Harris's Lexicon greatly influenced other dictionaries, providing material which was incorporated to increase the modernize the scientific and mathematical content of general dictionaries in England including The New World of Word by Phillips and Kersey, the anonymous <i>Glossographia Anglicana Nova<i>, the <i>Dictionarium Britannicum<i> of Nathan Bailey, and <i>New General English Dictionary<i> of Thomas Dyche and William Pardon. It is also clear that the <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> influenced Ephraim Chambers's <i>Cyclopedia<i> and Diderot's <i>Encyclop√©die<i>. The second volume of Harris' encyclopedic dictionary is mostly mathematical and astronomical tables, intended to serve as a small mathematical library.||Volume 1 of the <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> appeared in five editions: 1704, 1708, 1716, 1725, and 1736. Only the edition of 1704 included the list of subscribers. Volume2 appeared in three editions: 1710, 1723, and 1736. The final publication of the two volumes of the <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> was in 1736 and was the first time the two volumes were edited and issue simultaneously. A supplement was published in 1774, labeled Volume 3. It is not known who edited the work after Harris' death in 1719.
","John Harris's encyclopedic dictionary had an emphasis on mathematics and science, though it included topics from the humanities, arts, law, commerce, music, and heraldry. The contributors were recognized experts and generally produced essays that presented the latest contemporary information. Though considered a technical lexicon, this did not mean machines or manufacturing. It meant, rather, mathematics and its applications such as navigation, dialling, shipbuilding, architecture, fortification, optics and perspective. The second volume is mostly mathematical and astronomical tables, intended to serve as a small mathematical library.||The material on light and color is from Newton's 1672 letter in the Philosophical Transactions--Harris mentioning that the Opticks of 1704 came to late to hand be be studied and extracted carefully. The article on the Rainbow is by Edmond Halley. Additionally, there are articles on Optics, Optic Glasses, Optic Nerve, Reflection, Refraction in glass and air, Foci real and virtual, Colour, Eye, and Vision. The material related to physical optics is entirely Newtonian. The geometric optics material is contemporary, detailed, and analytic.","‚ÅÇ John Harris's <i>Lexicon Technicum<i>|Bradshaw, L.E.|In: <i>Notable Encyclopedias of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries<i>, Kafker, F.A., editor, Voltaire foundation, 1981, pp 107-123.||<i>Encyclopaedic Visions: Scientific Dictionaries and Enlightenment Culture<i>|Yeo, R.|Cambridge Universtiy Press, 2001, 341 p.||Diction and Dictionaries in the Diffusion of Scientific Knowledge: An Aspect of the History of the Popularization of Science in Great Britain|Layton, D.|<i>British Journal for the History of Science<i>, Vol 2, No 3, 1965, pp 221-234.",****,"<i>Lexicon Technicum<i>: Or, an Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves.

"Poliniere, Pierre",Pierre Poliniere,," ",1671-1734,,," ",Exp√©riences de Physique,"A manual of 100 experiments in natural philosophy; given is great detail, the results are explained with equal care. Experiments 84 through 100 deal with light and color.
","Poliniere first gave physics lectures at the College d'Harcourt at Paris in the mid 1690s and their success had them repeated in other colleges and in subsequent years. Poliniere was one of the first academic lecturers to incorporate demonstrations of physical principles. His lectures became demonstration/experiment based and their written form produced a kind of manual or list of experiments. Widely used and very popular, editions appeared in 1709, 1718, 1728, a posthumous edition based on manuscript notes in 1734, and a reprinting in 1741. King Louis XV himself attended the course given in 1722--according to the preface of the posthumous edition. The successive editions reveal a growing certainty about and reliance on experiment; first, simply to demonstrate principles, but eventually to discover them. The second edition of 1718 both introduces Newton's ideas regarding color, but also shows the lingering hesitancy about reliance on experiment. By the time of the third edition, Poliniere had become completely convinced of the soundness of the experimental method as the basis for physics. The experiments, their results, and conclusions drawn from them are now presented without the caution and hedging found in the earlier editions; he now asserts that the principles of physics can be discovered directly and reliably by experiment.","A manual of 100 experiments in natural philosophy; given is great detail, the results are explained with equal care. Experiments 84 through 100 deal with light and color. This includes: colors in chemical solutions and materials; refraction, prismatic colors, the rainbow and its production; burning mirrors; vision; lenses of convex and concave figure; camera obscura; spectacles and optical instruments; and phosphor. The treatment is Cartesian, elementary and qualitative, but very clear in presentation.","‚ÅÇ The Notion of Experimental Physics in Early Eighteenth-Century France|Home, R.W.|In: <i>Change and Progress in Modern Science<i>|Reidel Publishing, 1985, pp 107-131.||Poliniere and the teaching of physics at Paris: 1700-1730, Hanna, B.T.|In: <i>Eighteenth-Century Studies Presented to Arthur M.

"Scheuchzer, Johann Jakob",Johann Jakob Scheuchzer,," ",1672-1733,,," ",Physica,A summary of physics for the general reader. The earliest presentation of Newtonian optics in Germany.,"Second edition of Scheuchzer's <i>Physica<i>. It presents a summary of late 17th century natural philosophy for the interested lay reader. Like Bernard Nieuwentyt, Scheuchzer felt that the natural world directly reflected the work and presence of God. Though he presents a compendium of natural philosophy, it is explicitly grounded in his religious beliefs. His preface makes clear his idea of the relation between physics and scripture. Physics is based on experience and reason, not on authority. Though the Bible does speak about certain natural facts, it is not a complete textbook on natural knowledge and cannot be used to decide controversies in physics. Still, he says 'it is uncontrovertible that any time that [the Bible], in the representation of spiritual and celestial things, speaks about the nature and properties of natural things, this saying has to be taken as divine and infallible.' However tictured with religion, Schenchzer work usually avoided such questions, and simply reported the results of works in natural philosophy. He is careful and detailed to cite the authors from he draws his material. He makes no original contributions of his own.||The second and subsequent editions of Scheuchzer‚Äôs <i>Physica<i> differ from the first, principally by  their changes to the original chapter on light and an entirely  new  chapter, some thirty pages long, devoted to Newton's theory of prismatic colors. Scheuchzer cites the <i>Optice<i> of 1706, the Latin translation of Newton's <i>Opticks<i> of 1704, and brings to the wider German public the first description of  Newton‚Äôs discoveries. Scheuchzer's <i>Physica<i> was cited by Goethe in his <i>Geschichte der Farbenlehre<i>, as an example of how Newton's color theory came to be accepted in Germany. Scheuchzer's summary of Newton's optics was  widely-known in Germany--the publication  history of Scheuchzer‚Äôs compendium  attests to its popularity--and  was  probably  the  chief  source  for the  dissemination  of Newton‚Äôs  optical theories in Germany after 1711. The only earlier reference was much shorter reference in Chrisitan Wolff's <i>Der Anfangs-GruÃànde Aller Mathematischen Wissenschaften<i> textbook of 1710.||Scheuchzer's <i>Physica<i> is the earliest of a series of works that brought Newtonian optics to Germany early in the 18th century. These include Johann George Hoffman‚Äôs <i>Kurtze Fragen  von  den Natiirlichen Dingen<i> of 1719, which fully accepts Newton‚Äôs  color theory, and Johann Matthaes Barth‚Äôs <i>Physica Generalior, oder kurze Satze von denen natiirlichen Korpern √ºberhaupt<i> of 1724, which describes and explains it. Editions of Scheuchzer's <i>Physica<i> appeared in 1701, 1711, 1721, 1729, and 1743.

","In his Forward, Scheuchzer cautions against adhering to one school of thought, mentioning Aristotle, Plato, Epicurus, Descartes, and Gassendi. Further, he argues for a mix of both sense-data (experiments) and reason, neither excluding the other. He cites Descartes as an example of reasoning without data. Scheuchzer holds that experiments, observations, and mathematics are required for natural philosophy, while hypotheses should be avoided.||The body of the <i>Physica<i> is in two parts and follows the traditional separation of <i>Physica Generalis<i> from <i>Physica Particularis<i>. Part 1 contains 37 chapters, dealing with the general aspects of natural philosophy: Mater and its properties, Motion of several types, Nature of Light. It is here that Scheuchzer devotes twenty-nine pages to a detailed summary of the <i>Optice,<i> including descriptions of the principal experiments and the precise reproduction of Newton's mathematical  tables  and  calculations. And though the section on motion presents several theories, the laws of motion from Newton's <i>Principia<i> have pride of place.||Part 2 contains 38 chapters dealing with particular aspects of natural philosophy: The heavens and planets, Air, Fire, Heat and Cold. Plants, Animals, and Man. In the chapters on astronomy, Scheuchzer discusses the geocentric and heliocentric systems of the universe and presents a extensive array of data about the planets and stars. Though he holds with the Copernican system, he does explain the Ptolemaic and Tychonian systems. He also gives, in  detail, the arguments both for and against the heliocentric system. His discusses Kepler‚Äôs planetary laws and how they are supported by Newton. In the chapters on the earth, he focuses on natural phenomena above, on, and beneath the its surface. This material is treated as a natural historian would,  describing and classifying a wide range of specific phenomena. There is a natural history of the waters, winds, stones and an especially detailed consideration of minerals. Animals and Man receive a briefer and more traditional treatment.

","By the time these notes were produced (1713) The University of Parma had been staffed with a mixed Civil and Jesuit faculty for more than a century. Jesuits taught theology, philosophy (logic, natural philosophy, metaphysics), mathematics, and humanities. The Civil faulty taught law and medicine. These notes are for a course in optics given by one Padre Becano, SJ. The title <i>Institutiones Optice sive de Oculo Naturali<i>  show the intention of the text is to study the eye and vision. Just enough geometric optics is covered to allow for a consideration of ocular optics and the function of simple optical instruments. The text is accompanied by 20 leaves giving 63 very carefully hand-drawn figures. The text is in a small, round hand, in brown ink.
","The material centers on the eye and its function, the nature and characteristics of vision, and how simple optical instruments can aid vision. The ocular anatomy is that of Felix Plater and Kepler, but not yet that of Scheiner. Anatomy is covered just sufficiently to show how the eye forms images. Refraction and its role in the function of lenses is presented, along with the principles of focus, magnification, and images. The only material on geometric optics is simple ray-tracing through lenses. No physical optics is presented. The aspects of vision covered include size, position, motion, and binocular view.

","First edition of the first teaching compendium of natural philosophy in Castilian. Tosca wrote for his students, and the style and clarity of the books benefited from his long practice in teaching. The nine volumes are meant to cover all of mathematics and philosophy: I Arithmetic and Geometry, II Algebra and music, III Trigonometry and conics, IV Statics and Hydrostatics, V Civil and Military Architecture, VI Optics and Meteorics, VII Astronomy, VIII Geography and Navigation, IX Gnomics and Astrology. Tosca's textbooks were widely used and responsible, in part, for the introduction of modern science in Spain. The volumes of the first edition appeared at Valentia: V 1: 1707; V2: 1709; V3: 1710; V 4-5: 1712; V 6: 1713; V 7-9: 1715. The entire set was reprinted in Madrid in 1727 and 1757. Later in the century, Benito Bails would produced an equally comprehensive compendium, <i>Elementos de Mathem√°tica<i>, in which he acknowledged Tosca's work and its place in Spanish intellectual history.
","The first teaching compendium of natural philosophy in Castilian. Volume six contains five sections on optics and meteorics, treatises XVIII - XXII. Section I Optics: general considerations and definitions; nature and propagation of light; nature of colors; transparent and opaque bodies; view and vision; eye-function; perception of size and shape; binocular vision. Section II Perspective: principles, iconographic and orthographic projection; methods for representing objects in various orientations; linear perspective; perspective of light, shadow, and reflected bodies; perspective of curved surfaces. Section III Catoptrics: general considerations an definitions; plane mirrors and their properties; convex and concave mirrors; cylindrical mirrors; spherical mirrors, caustics; simple rules for placing images from mirrors. Section IV Dioptrics:  refraction and its effects; cause and properties of refraction; location of refracted images; refractive glasses and their properties; combining refracting bodies; convex lenses, concave lenses; refraction and the generation of colors. Section V Meteorics: the sea and the wind; atmosphere and clouds, all type of precipitation; lighting; lights generated in the air; the rainbow; other forms of light; comets.||Though the basis is essentially Cartesian, Tosca also cites Grimaldi, Kircher, Scheiner, Zahn, Dechales, Rheyta, Zucchi, but not Huygens (1690) or Newton (1704). The wave and corpuscular theories of the nature of light are presented, but each is considered unproven. But Tosca presents experiments that support the wave hypothesis and he invokes the the analogy to sound propagation as also supporting the wave hypothesis. Color theory follows Pardies and is a hybrid of Aristotelian and Cartesian. The material is detailed, descriptive, and presented with mathematics no more advanced than geometry.","El ""Compendio Mathem√°tico"" del padre Tosca y la introducci√≥n de la ciencia moderna en Espa√±a|Cu√©llar, M.R.|In: <i>Actas del Segundo Congreso Espa√±ol de Historia de la Medicina<i>,  Vol 1|Salamanca, 1965, pp 325-359.||<i>La introducci√≥n de la ciencia moderna en Espa√±a<i>|L√≥pez Pi√±ero, J.

"Wells, Edward",Edward Wells,," ",1667-1727,,," ","The Young Gentleman's Trigonometry, Mechanicks, and Opticks","An elementary textbook of natural philosophy with an extensive section on optics with extensive figures.
","Among the unwearying output of Edward Wells, was a three-volume course in Mixed Mathematics. The topics included Arithmetick and Geometry; Mechanicks, Opticks, and Trigonometry; and Astronomy, Chronology, and Dialling. Wells's purpose was to provide textbooks written in simple language that could be use by student and craft practitioner. His audience required an emphasis on the practical application of knowledge and though the material is mainly descriptive, geometry is used extensively. In optics, for example, Wells foundation is vision and his preface states that he wishes to be about not 'only explaining the Manner of Vision in a Geometrical Way, but also by the same Principles teaching how to supply or remedy the several Defects of the Sight, by the Help of proper Instruments, such as Spectacles.'||Wells's texts were standbys, widely used in England and America in the first half of the 18th century. The three volumes appears between 1712- and 1714. Between 1718 and 1736 parts of the books were reissued separately: The <i>Young Gentleman's Astronomy, Chronology, and Dialling<i> issued in 1718, 1725, and 1736; The <i>Young Gentleman's Arithmetick and Geometry<i> issued in 1723, and <i>The Young Gentleman's Trigonometry, Mechanicks, and Opticks<i> issued in 1731.
","The optics section (74 pages) includes: elementary geometrical optics, ocular anatomy, euclidean-geometric visual perception; reflection, plane and spherical mirrors and the images created; refraction, lenses of convex and concave figure and the images created; the magic lantern, microscope, and telescope; and perspective. The optics material is complete in elementary essentials, geometry-based, and accompanied by 66 figures.","The teaching of elementary geometry in the seventeenth century|Kokomoor, F.W.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 11, No 1, 1928, pp 85-110.||The Book Collections of Early American College Libraries|Kraus, J.W.|<i>The Library Quarterly<i>, Vol 43, No 2, 1973, pp 142-159.",****,"The Young Gentleman's Trigonometry, Mechanicks, and Opticks.

Contains the queries in the <i>Opticks<i> of 1704, those new in the <i>Optice<i> of 1706, and eight new ones dealing with the aether.","See Entry 228. The Opticks would have vast influence, particularly in the form of its Latin translation that appeared in 1706 and this, the second English edition, each with additional Queries. Newton's fundamental propositions of the chromatic heterogeneity of white light and varying chromatic refrangibility was generally accepted by the time this edition appeared. The corpuscular theory of light's nature, proposed in the Queries, would set the terms of the debate with the wave theory of light for all of the 17th century. The Queries were renumbered in this and subsequent editions. English editions of the <i>Opticks<i> appeared in 1704, 1717, 1721, 1730, and 1931.

","See Entry 228. The second English edition of the Optics contains the original 16 Queries of the Opticks, the 7 added in the Optics of 1706, and 8 new ones. The 8 Queries new in the second English edition are placed after the original 16 and are number 17-24. The 7 Queries new in the Optice of 1706 are here numbers 25-31, and adds extensively to Queries 10 and 11. The Optice also provides an addendum describing luminescent light sources. Queries  25-31 were new in the Optice and deal with double refraction and, perhaps most importantly, the nature of space, the plenum, the aether, and luminous corpuscles. Query 31, new in the Optice, is the longest of all, by far, and deals with gravitational attraction and ends with Newton's remarkable paragraph linking the development of natural and moral philosophy.. Queries 17-24, new in the second English edition, deal with the Newton's idea of the aether or subtle, particular matter and its interaction with heat and light. Also new in the second English edition is reference to the ""mercurial light"" of Hauksbee's experiments.","‚ÅÇ Preface and Introduction|Cohen, I.B. and Whittaker, E.|In: <i>Opticks, Sir Isaac Newton<i>|Dover, New York, 1952, pp ix-lvii.||Les Queries de l'Optique|Koyre, A.|<i>Archieves Internationales d'Histoire des Sciences<i>, Vol 13, 1960, pp 15-29.||The methodological origins of Newton‚Äôs queries|Anstey, P.R.|<i>Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science<i>, Vol 35, 2004, pp 247-269.||Sir Isaac and the ingenious Mr. Hauksbee|Guerlac, H.|In: <i>M√©langes Alexandre Koyr√©: L'aventure de la science<i>|Hermann, Paris, 1964, pp 228-253, NB 250-253.",****,"Opticks: or a Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light.

"Rohault, Jacques",Jacques Rohault,," ",1618-1672,"Samuel Clarke (1675-1729) English philosopher and cleric, correspondent, translator.",t,"Translated by Samuel Clarke (1675-1729) English philosopher and cleric, correspondent, translator.",Physica,"Fourth edition of Samuel Clarke's Latin translation of Jacques Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> of 1671, a complete textbook of Cartesian-based natural philosophy. Fully empirical, with numerous experiments and observations reported to test theory and hypothesis. Cartesian optics includes the nature of light, color, transparency and opacity.","At the end of his preface to the first French edition of the <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> of 1671, Jacques Rohault mentions that he was 'preparing a Latin version in favor of foreigners, in whom I dare promise myself a fairly favorable reception.' But Rohault never publish a Latin translation. The first was this very close translation produced by the Geneva physician TheÃÅophile Bonet which appeared at Geneva in 1674. It was reprinted at London and Amsterdam in 1682, at Amsterdam in 1691 and 1700 and at London in 1691 with notes by the Franciscan Antoine Le Grand, at Amsterdam in 1708 and Cologne in 1713 with notes by both Le Grand and Samuel Clarke. For use at English universities, Clarke made a second Latin translation that appeared at London in 1697 and preprinted in 1702, 1710, and 1718 (this edition). It was into these editions of his Latin translation of Rohault that Clarke added every more numerous and lengthy notes, augmenting, supplanting, and eclipsing Cartesianism with Newtonianism.||Clarke's translation was one of the most widely used textbooks in Europe in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The influence of Clarke's translation and his notes rested on the way it introduced and propagated Newton's physics among all those who were not keen on mathematical details of physical processes, but interested in the new explanatory quality of Newtonian physics. This is a reprinting of the third edition of 1710, the last Clarke produced in his life time, and contains half-again as many notes as the previous edition, now comprising nearly one-fifth of the book, and eight additional plates of figures. This was the third and last revision and extension that Clarke made of his notes and since by this time the <i>Optice<i> of 1706 had appeared, it was heavily referenced in the optics section.","Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> is in four parts. Part 1 is in 35 chapters and covers principles of physics, nature of matter, motion and its analysis, forms of matter, heat and cold, the senses of taste, smell, and hearing, and finally the eye, optics, and vision. The Cartesian principles of extension, divisibility, motion, and rest are used to deduce general laws of statics, dynamics, and--via ballistic conceptions  of reflection and refraction--optics. Part 2 is in 29 chapters and covers cosmography, astronomy, selenography, the planets and their movements, the fixed stars, and finally the competing theories of the sun and planets. Rohault plumps for the Copernican as the most rational. Part 3 is in 17 chapters and covers geology in general, including the Earth and things that are part of it, such as the atmosphere, the seas, metals and minerals, fountains, winds, fogs and clouds, rain and hail, snow and frosts, lighting, and finally the rainbow. Part 4 is in 26 chapters and covers anatomy, muscles and movement, blood and circulation, digestion and breathing, and finally maladies and disease.||The optics material, though patterned closely after Descartes' essay La Dioptrique, it is fully empirical with experiments, demonstrations, and observations reported to test theory and hypothesis. The topics include: the nature of light, color, transparency and opacity. Direct, reflected, and refracted light are demonstrated as well as the simpler forms of image formation by mirrors and lenses. Descartes theory of vision is presented in full. All the optical topics are treated in an elementary but thorough manner. Thus, for example, the focusing properties of spherical convex lenses are demonstrated, but nothing is said of spherical aberration.||Experiment receives a double role: on the one hand, it is shown how it discriminates between conjectures pointing to the ones that are empirically confirmed; on the other hand, it is a powerful pedagogical tool that can convince the reader of explanations given and laws stated.||As with the other topics, Rohault's Cartesian optics is accompanied by Samuel Clarke's notes containing additions, amplifications, and corrections derived from Newton's <i>Opticks<i> of 1704 and the <i>Optice<i> of 1706.","Samuel Clarke‚Äôs Annotations in Jacques Rohault‚Äôs <i>Trait√© de Physique<i>, and How They Contributed to Popularising Newton‚Äôs Physics|Volkmar Sch√ºller, V.|In: <i>Between Leibniz, Newton, and Kant<i>, Wolfgang Lefovre, editor,  2001, NB: pp 95-110.||Rohault's Cartesian Physics|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Cartesian Empiricisms<i>, Springer, 2013, pp 203-226.||Rohault's Traite de Physique and its Newtonian Reception|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Proceedings of the 4th International Conference of the ESHS<i>, 2010, pp 389-394.||The experimental physics of Jacques Rohault|Spink A.|<i>British Journal for the History of Philosophy<i>, Vol 26, No 5, 2017, pp 850-870.||The Study of Early Scientific Textbooks|Sarton, G.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 38, No 3/4, 1948, pp 137-148.||Motion and God in XVIIth Century Cartesian manuals: Rohault, R√©gis and Gadroys|Milani, N.E.|<i>Noctua<i> Vol 2, Nos.1-2, 2015, pp 481-516.",****,"Jabobi Rohaulti Physica.

"¬¥s Gravesande, Willem Jacob",Willem Jacob ¬¥s Gravesande,," ",1688-1742,,," ",Physices elementa mathematica,"The <i>Physices elementa mathematica<i>, a handbook of physics covering virtually all of its subjects, is the basis for 's Gravesande's subsequent handbooks and textbooks.
","The <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> is the foundation of 's Gravesande's fame, and the basis for his subsequent other handbooks and textbooks which became the most important and influential of the Newtonian educational works on the continent and in England. It relied on what it presented as the Newtonian notion of dependence on only experiment and geometry. The content, scope, and style of the <i>Physices Elementa Nathematica<i> and it's various subsequent versions were both embodiment and extension of 's Gravesande's deeply influential teaching and the reason the books were so influential in the 18th century. They had sufficient compelling clarity to help eventually overcame the predominance of Cartesianism in France and the Leibnizian-Wolffianism of Germany and Russia.|The first edition of the Latin text appeared in 1720, the second edition of 1725 was enlarged and intended more for scientific peers rather than students, the edition of 1742 was extensively reworked and augmented, and the last edition appeared in 1748. The <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> was also translated into English by Desaguliers, appearing in six editions, and into French in 1745. A portable, one-volume abridgement of the Latin text appeared in 1723.
","A handbook of physics covering: statics; dynamics; gravity; fluids; fire, heat, light, and electro-luminescence; optics; system of the world; and celestial motion. The optics section (90 pages or about 15% of the text) includes: the nature and propagation of light; refraction; Newtonian spectral refraction; spherical lenses; eye and vision; spectacles for vision correction; microscopes, telescopes, and their use; reflection and catoptrics; the magic lantern; color, chromatic heterogeneity of white light, spectra, the rainbow, colors of thin plates, colors in nature. The main points are demonstrated by experiments, their presentation detailed and geometry-based. Numerous detailed figures, descriptions of demonstration apparatus and their use, and elaborate cross-referencing are notable.||The physical optics that 's Gravesande's text presents has fire and light as manifestations of an 'elemental fire', with both sharing many of the same properties. The fundamental aspect of propagation is emission--as opposed to traveling waves--and the interaction of light with materials in reflection, refraction, and diffraction is ascribed to the effect of forces operating over very small distances. 's Gravesande's emission theory is a kind of filtered and simplified version of Newton's ideas; it avoids any mention of the aether that Newton mentioned in the later Queries of the Optice of 1706, does not deal with double refraction, and does not mention Newton's fits of easy transmission and reflection or his suggestion regarding 'sides' or 'poles' of the light particles. Also notable is the absence of consideration of any other theory of the the nature of light and its propagation.","‚ÅÇ ‚Äôs Gravesande and Musschenbroek: Newtonianism at Leiden|Ruestow, E.G.|In: <i>Physics at Seventeenth and Eighteenth-Century Leiden: Philosophy and the New Science in the University<i>|Springer, 1973, 174 pp, NB: pp 113-139.||The impeccable credentials of an untrained philosopher: Willem Jacob 's¬†Gravesande's career before his Leiden professorship, 1688‚Äì1717|Jip van Besouw|<i>Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 70, No 3, pp 231‚Äì249.|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4978728/",****,"Physices elementa mathematica, experimentis confirmata.

With a new preface by the translator.
","The origins and production of the second edition of Coste's French translation of the <i>Opticks<i> of 1717/1718 rests principally with the mathematician and friend of Isaac Newton, Pierre Varignon. Varignon was asked by officials governing Royal Privilege for his opinion regarding publishing Coste's translation in France. Varignon approval contained high praise for the book and its author. Varignon would become overseer for the project of publishing the translation in France and to some extent Coste became somewhat of an unhappy bystander to the entire process. At one point, Varignon brought in the French Chancellor Henri Fran√ßois d'Aguesseau to bring the book's wayward publisher-bookseller to heel--a token of the importance given the book by a wide and influential audience. Abraham De Moivre was asked by Varignon to suggest changes to the text and submit them to Newton for approval. Coste also suggested changes but Varignon would take none of Coste's suggestions unless they were approved by Newton himself. In this way Newton became tangled up in the production of the book, eventually approving Coste's suggested changes, to the annoyance of Varignon, though the changes suggested by both De Moivre and Coste were not significant.||Varignon and Chancellor d'Aguesseau rejected early proof sheets and directed the printer to use new type. These sheets were shown to Newton for his approval and, at Verignon's suggestion, left significant space at the start of each Part for a vignette. At Varignon's request, Newton himself provided a sketch for the first of these; it and the others were drawn in final form by Jean Chaufourier and engraved by Antoine Herisset. As in the first edition, translations of Newton's Prefaces for the English editions of 1704 and 1717/1718 are provided. The new edition appeared in quarto at Paris in 1722 and marked the near-general acceptance of Newton's optical theories in France.

"Rizzetti, Giovanni",Giovanni Rizzetti,," ",1675-1751,,," ","De luminis affectionibus ","A thoroughgoing attack on Newton's theory of colors and white light homogeneity.
","The origins of Rizzetti's book is his paper <i>De Systemate Opticae Newtonianae et de Aberratione in Humore Chrystallino<i> that he submitted to the Royal Society in London in 1722 and to the <i>Acta Eruditorum<i> in 1724. The paper claimed to have found Newton's experiments either faulty or inconclusive and--in Rizzetti's view--failing to support Newton theory of heterochromatic white light and the immutability of monochromatic light. He reported his failure to reproduce Newton's experiment involving black thread on blue and red-colored cards and claimed that prismatic colors were the result of aberrations in the lens of the eye. In London, John Theophilus Desaguliers responded with an article in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society reporting the public demonstration of Newton's experiment and calling on Rizzetti to admit his errors. In Germany, the mathematician Friedrich Richter answered Rizzetti with a severely critical article that appeared in the same issue of the Acta Eruditorum as Rizzetti's. All this seems to have simply spurred Rizzetti: five years after his first paper, he published <i>De Luminis Affectionibus<i>, a book containing a large number of additional experiments and a long diatribe against Newton. Desaguliers responded with a 35-page paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society reporting the repetition of experiments before the Royal Society and several foreign visitors, including four Italian Abb√©s. Unlike his response to Rizzetti's paper of 1722, in 1728 Desaguliers is sharp, critical, and aggressively defensive of Newton. The response to Rizzetti's book in Italy was embarrassment and uniformly negative. It prompted Fracensco Algarotti to consider a public response which would take the form of his famous <i>Newtonianismo  per  le  Dame<i>. Rizzetti's book is important in that the swift, thorough, and unanimous negative response shows the extent and completeness with which Newtonian optical ideas had taken hold in Europe by the time of Newton's death.
","Rizzetti's work contains two Books. Book One contains four chapters and a summary: The refraction of light; Refrangibility of colors; The dispersion of light; The reflection of light; The nature of light. Book two contains a prologue, four chapters, and a summary: Colors in general; Natural colors; Apparent colors; Celestial phenomena; Imaginary colors; The nature of colors||The work attempts to be a thoroughgoing attack on Newton's theory of colors and white light homogeneity. Rizzett's preface contains a long diatribe against Newton and sets the polemic nature of the entire work. A few of Newton's experiments are presented as either failing or false and so Rizzetti rejects all of Newton's optical theories. The nature of light and color that is presented is a throwback to Scholastic teaching and there are many polemically-presented experiments with results that were claimed to contradict the ideas of Newton. Remarkably, the idea of color dispersion is rejected entirely and the old theory that color is a modification or mixing of white and black in invoked. Prismatic colors are dismissed as the result of aberrations within the eye.","‚ÅÇ The Reception of Newtonian Optics in Italy|Casini, P.|In: <i>Renaissance and Revolution: Humanists, Scholars, Craftsmen and Natural Philosophers<i>|Cambridge University Press, 1993, 308 pp, NB pp 215-228.||Optical Experiments Made in the beginning of August 1728, before the President and Several member of the Royal Society, and other Gentlemen of Several Nations, upon Occasion of Signior Rizzetti's Opticks, with an Account of the Said Book|Desaguliers, J.T.|<i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 25, 1727, pp 596-629.",****,De luminis affectionibus specimen physico mathematicum Johannis Rizzetti in duos libros divisum.

","This part includes a printing of Latin versions of <i>Traite de la lumiere<i> (<i>De Lumine<i>), <i>Discours de la cause de la pesanteur<i> (<i>De Causa Gravitatis Dissertatio<i>), and <i>Geometria Dissertatio<i>. The <i>De Lumine<i> is a Latin rendering of Huygens' principal printed work on optics. The <i>Traite De La Lumiere<i> is in six chapters. Chapter 1: On Rays Propagated  in Straight Lines. Chapter 2: On Reflection. Chapter 3: On Refraction. Chapter 4: On Refraction of the Air. Chapter 5: On the Strange Refraction of Iceland Crystal. Chapter 6: On the Figures of Transparent Bodies Which Serve for Refraction and Reflection.||Chapter 1 reviews the classic phenomena of optics and how their nature and properties comprise required outcomes for any theory of light. These include rectilinear propagation of rays, equal angle reflection, and the sine law of refraction. The chapter then sets out Huygens' theory of wave propagation: A wave front produces wavelets with all but motion locally perpendicular to the original wave cancel, the cumulative effect leaves a new, advancing wave front. Spherical wave fronts generated in this way radiate from each point on a luminous surface. Rays of light are taken as the perpendiculars to wave fronts. Chapter 2 applies this principle to explain the equal angle law of specular reflection. By invoking the finite speed of light wave travel, the perpendiculars to the series of reflected wave fronts (reflected rays) are are show to make angles with the surface perpendicular that are equal to those of the rays of the incoming waves. Chapter 3 applies the same analysis, based on finite light wave speed to explain the sine law of refraction. Wave front speed is slower in denser media; the denser, the slower. Wave fronts travel more slowly once in the denser medium and a geometric construction shows their perpendiculars (the refracted rays) form an angle with the refracting surface perpendicular whose sine in ratio to that of incident rays is the ratio of the media densities. That is, the sine law of refraction. Chapter 4 applies wave front refraction to atmospheric refraction, showing how it produces curved rays. Chapter 5 explains the double refraction observed in Icelandic spar. In this case, Huygens proposes that refracted waves propagate in two directions in the crystal.   The wavelets for waves propagating in the 'extraordinary' direction are not spherical but elliptical and the resulting non-spherical wave fronts have perpendiculars that are the extraordinary rays of double refraction. Chapter 6 uses wave front analysis to determine ideal figures for reflecting and refracting surfaces. It is here that the cause of spherical aberration is derived. Huygens was a practiced oculist and though he shows the theoretical benefits of elliptical and hyperbolic figures for lenses, he is aware that as a practical matter, they were essentially impossible to produce.","<i>Lenses and Waves<i>|Dijksterhuis, F.J.|Kluwer, 2004, pp 213-253.",****,"Chrisitani Hugenii Zulichemi, Dum viveret Zelhemi Toparcae, Opera Reliqua Tomus Primus.","Remaining Works of Christian Huygens of Zuilichem, Govenor of Zelhem while alive.",1728,1725-1750,"Dutch mathematician, natural philosopher, oculist.

The distances of two sources that illuminated a split visual field were changed until the field was equally bright; the ratio of the square of the distances gave the relative luminous power of the two sources.,"Bouguer's interest in the measurement of light began with articles by Dortous Mairan in 1719 and 1721 regarding the power of the sun to light and heat differently in summer and winter. Bouguer apparently borrows the visual comparator first shown in Aguilon's <i>Opticorum<i> of 1613, and Dechales's law of diminishing luminous power derived from the geometry of the sphere, to devise a reliable method of relative photometry based on equality of visual perception. The Essai formed the basis for the first part of Bouger's posthumously published TraiteÃÅ d'Optique of 1760. A modern reprinting of the Essai appeared at Paris in 1921.

","An introductory text of natural philosophy covering Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, and Optics. Benjamin Worster and Thomas Watts had been engaged by Richard Steele to deliver a course in natural philosophy at Steele's Censorium--his presentation theater. This course was design to offer the English equivalent to Desagulier's course given in French at the Censorium. Worster and Watt's course of lectures began in 1719. Watts later engaged Worster at his own Academy in Little Tower Street to teach experimental and natural philosophy, and this text was written expressly to accompany this course of lectures delivered by Worster. The first edition appeared in 1772 and the second edition produced from corrections and additions in Worster's hand. The long introduction, 'To The Reader,' is by the publisher and bookseller Stephen Austen and sets out the reason for the second edition and recounts some of Worster's ideas from the edition of 1722.||Worster's intent is clear from the introduction quoted by Austen: not to describe or recount experiments or their apparatus, but to show how philosophical principles are deduced from experimental results. In this regard, Worster is and adherent and admirer of Bacon. Austen also recounts Worster's summary of gravity and central attractive forces.","An introductory text of natural philosophy covering Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, and Optics, meant to accompany Worster's series of experimental lectures. There are six sections. 1: Of Natural Philosophy in General. 2: Mechanics. 3: Laws of Motion. 4: Hydrostatics. 5: Pneumatics. 6: Optics. The optics section is the longest and most detailed. Rays of light are considered 'streams of Aether' but treated in a purely geometric fashion. Reflection and refraction as plane and spherical surfaces are considered. Interestingly, Worster's text contains one of the earliest image of a light ray path encountering a surface repulsive force, thus producing reflection. To account for refraction, Worster employes an elaborate version of Newton's 'Fits'. Simple convex and concave lenses are considered with analysis limited to determining focal points. Simple ocular anatomy is presented, together with a summary of the visual process. Mirrors, prismatic colors, natural colors of bodies, and the rainbow are also discussed. It is shown on lenses can be combined to produce the telescope and the microscope. The treatment of geometric optics is descriptive, with only elementary geometry being invoked. Physical optics - the reason for reflection and refraction - is expressed in terms of attractive forces and their action on light rays. The last sections list brief descriptions the experiments in Worster's lecture course. Twenty-four experiments are listed for Optics.","The Selling of Newton: Science and Technology in Early Eighteenth-Century England'|Stewart, L.|<i>Journal of British Studies<i>, Vol 25, No 2, April 1986, pp. 178-192.||'Richard Steele's Censorium'|Loftis, J.|<i>Huntington Library Quarterly<i> , Vol 14, No 1, Nov. 1950, pp. 43-66.||The Problem of Reflection in Eighteenth-Century Projectile Theories of Light|Breno Arsioli Moura|<i>Physics in Perspective<i>, Vol 22, 2020, pp 191-214.",****,"A Compendious and Methodical Account of the Principles of Natural Philosophy.

Johann Bernoulli II won the prize for the essay printed here by the Academy. The elaborate construct or vortices, oscillating corpuscles, and forces presented by Bernoulli is an example of the on-going desire for a fully mechanical explanation of light and its properties held in the 18th century.
","Prize-winning essay on the propagation of light. A hybrid of Cartesian and Malebrachean ideas was proposed: An aether of small vortices is supposed to be interspersed with hard corpuscles of various sizes. Movement of a corpuscle in a particular direction compresses a neighboring vortex, transmitting the motion along a line in that direction; a kind of luminous fiber with corpuscles oscillating in the direction of propagation. The result is linear ray propagation. This model was used to explain reflection, refraction, and interference.","<i>A History of Optics from Greek Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century<i>|Darrigol, O.|Oxford, 2012, pp 146-149.",****,Recherches Physiques et G√©om√©triques sur la Question: Comment se fait la Propagation de la Lumi√©re (disbound),Physical and Geometric Researches on the Question: How does Light Propagate?,1736,1725-1750,"Swiss mathematician, chemist, physician.

"Rowning, John",John Rowning,," ",1701?-1771,,," ",A compendious system of natural philosophy,"A compendium of natural philosophy written specifically for students lacking higher mathematics.","Written specifically for students lacking higher mathematics, the content is drawn from Rowning's lessons given at Cambridge. The notes would have accompanied material taught by tutors, rather than being a textbook for a formal course. Descriptive and non-mathematical, it forms a stark contrast with French natural philosophy texts in use at the same time. The bibliography of this work is all but unresolvable; each part was issued separately, went through different editions, and was separately paginated. Overall, seven editions appeared between 1735 and 1772.
","A compendium of natural philosophy including: properties of bodies, laws of motion, mechanical power;  hydrostatics and pneumatics; optics; astronomy; orreries, globes, and chronology. The extended optics section (215 pages) includes: light's nature and propagation; reflection; refraction at plane and spherical surfaces; lenses; the eye; vision; images from mirrors and lenses; color and differing refraction; colors of objects; the cause of opacity, transparency, and refraction in materials; microscopes and telescopes; the rainbow; camera obscura and the magic lantern. The treatment is entirely Newtonian but, despite the title, is generally descriptive and geometric, not mathematical. Though a few places in the optics section contain footnotes with analytic details and equations.||Rowning considers the mechanisms of reflection and refraction, taking up various theories prominent at the time including Newton's (ballistic),  Musschenbroek's (surface repulsive power), attractive force, and undulatory motion. Rowning plumps for Newton, but states that he finds none of these ideas satisfying or plausible. Indeed, in his Preface, Rowning states he is unable to present a theory based on existing principles of natural philosophy that explain reflection of light and the basic luminous power of radiant surfaces. Regarding refraction, Rowning invokes attractive cohesion force to account for the bending of light rays.","The Problem of Reflection in Eighteenth-Century Projectile Theories of Light|Breno Arsioli Moura|<i>Physics in Perspective<i>, Vol 22, 2020, pp 191-214.",****,"A compendious system of natural philosophy : With notes, containing the mathematical demonstrations, and some occasional remarks.

","Girolamo Fabrizio's  <i>De Visione, Voce, Auditu<i> of 1600 is one of the last significant perspectivist works, resting as it does on medieval theories of vision. Within 5 years Platter and Kepler would clarify the function of the components of the eye and in 20 years Scheiner would establish modern ocular anatomy. The collected works of Fabrizio were first edited by Johann Bohn and appeared in Leipzig in 1687. This later edition of 1738 was edited by Bernad Albin, and includes a biographical sketch of Fabrizio. It had been nearly 150 years since Frabrizio's work and its first appearance; only scholarly, not practical, interest can explain the re-editing and re-issuing.
","The collected works of Fabrizio, including <i>De Visione, Voce, Auditu<i> of 1600. Fabrizio held that one should describe Ô¨Årst the dissection and anatomy of a structure, then its independent action, and Ô¨Ånally its interdependent function in the body. That is, he aimed to discuss not just anatomy but physiology too. Thus the title: vision, voice, and hearing, rather than eye, larynx, and ear. The discussion of the eye and vision is entirely and completely medieval perspectivist. This involves: an upright image onto the crystalline lens, it being the seat of vision; perception based on geometric ideas originating at the beginning of perspectivism by Bacon, Alhacen, Witelo, and Peckham; the mechanisms of vision (lumen and lux) based on the Aristotelian idea of actualized potential qualities of materials. Only the anatomy presented is forward-looking and it presents a considerable advance, documented with exceptional plates of figures of the external anatomy of the eye. Some of these are reused by Platter and again by Kepler.","‚ÅÇ Hieronymus Fabricius d'Aquapendente : De visione, Ending of the Perspectivistic Tradition|De Nil, E. ,De Mey, M.|In: <i>Optics and Astronomy: Proceedings of the XXth International Congress of History of Science<i>|Brepols Publishers, 2001, pp 51-81.||Hieronymous Fabricius Ab Acquapendente (1533‚Äì1619)|Smith, S.B., Macchi, V., Parenti, A., DeCaro, R.|<i>Clinical Anatomy<i>, Vol 17, No 4, 2004, pp 540-543.",****,"Hieronymi Fabricii ab Aquapendente, Philosophi ac Medici, inque Florenttissimo Gymnasio Patavino Anatomes ac Chirurgiae Professoris Publici, singularis & supraordinarii, Opera omnia anatomica & physiologica, Hactenus variis locis ac formis edita : nunc vero certo ordine digesta, & in unum Volumen redacta.

Only later did it become generally know that he had produced the book. A pirated edition, again without Passemant's name, appeared in Amsterdam in 1741 and is the version which circulated more widely and was the most influential, triggering as it did the development of reflecting telescope making in the Netherlands. The book was specifically written for those 'who want to construct a telescope of their own.' The plate of figures was drawn and etched by J.B. Scotin.||Though Newton had demonstrated his reflecting telescope in 1668, metal mirrors were difficult to make, figure, polish, and keep from tarnishing. It was only in the 1720s and 1730s that this craft advanced enough for the construction of practical instruments. Passemant's book appeared the same year as Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i>. Though both texts detail the development of telescope optics, Passemant's book contains details regarding the making of telescope mirrors that only a practitioner could present.
","Manual for the construction of reflecting telescopes and lensed microscopes. Includes: Molds and forms for metal mirrors; material for mirrors, how they are shaped, figured, and polished; construction of the other components of a reflecting telescope; using reflecting telescopes; examples of telescope construction; arrangement and orientation of telescopes with large mirrors; making objective and ocular lenses, simple and compound; making and using microscopes. The presentation is detailed and clearly the result of the extensive direct practice and experience of the author.

","Elizabeth Carter's translation of Algarotti's <i>Il Newtonianismo per le Dame<i> gives evidence of her interest in and understanding of mathematics and astronomy. Her translation shows specialist knowledge of Newtonian ideas and is remarkable for footnotes that quote extensively from literary and scientific sources, including Pierre Bayle's General Dictionary. Carter's translation is not a rote one; she adopted strategies for altering Algarotti's text to make it more narrowly focused on the science it contained. She either smoothed over or eliminated the erotic or misogynistic portions of Algarotti's text and also eliminated many of the specific references to socio-political change in what was then known as 'Italy'. In these way, the English version of Algarotti was considerably different than the Italian. In the second edition of the <i>Il Newtonianismo per le Dame<i> published in Milan in 1739, Algarotti commented on this English translation, wishing it had been more faithful to the original--likely an objection to Carter's strategic changes. Editions of the translation appeared in London in 1739, 1742, 1772 and Glasgow in 1765. 
","English translation of the <i>Il Newtonianismo per le Dame<i> of 1737. Six lively dialogues between Francesco Algarotti (the narrator) and a Marchioness on Newton's theories of light and color. These include: A general idea of physics and hypotheses concerning light and color; Light and color as qualities, general principles of optics; vision and discoveries in optics and their use in refuting Descartes; experimental philosophy and Newton's system of optics; further exposition of Newton's optics; Newton's principle of attraction and its application in optics.

In 1735 Castel wrote a series of articles for the Journal de Trevoux on new experiments in optics and acoustics. The <i>L‚ÄôOptique des couleurs<i> is an elaboration and explanation of those ideas. A firm Anti-Newtonian, Castel opposed virtually all of the new natural philosophy and his though can be considered the result of  grafting Cartesianism onto scholasticism. Widely read, the book received blistering reviews in the scientific press but the idea of an instrument that simultaneously presented sounds and their 'matching' colors appealed to many outside of such circles. Popularizing the idea of such an instrument was the only influence the book had; its color theory far too antiquarian to be considered seriously.
","A general development of color theory applied to painting, perception, and sound. It presents: general consideration of color, separating artificial prismatic colors from the real colors of pigments and objects; white and black as the origin of colors; chromatic harmony and its basis in the 'primitive colors' of nature; specific shades of blue, red, and yellow as primitive colors; color circles, their application in art, and their relationship to musical scales; derivation of 144 true, real colors and their relation to the musical scale; previous letters giving several negative assessments of Newton's theory of colors; and the ocular harpsichord. The development is descriptive, no mathematics is involved, and the basis is a hybrid of scholasticism and Cartesianism.","‚ÅÇ  <i>Louis-Bertrand Castel, Anti-Newtonian Scientist<i>|Schier, D.S.|Torch Press, 1941.",****,"L'optique des couleurs, FondeÃÅe sur les simples observations, & tourneÃÅe sur-tout aÃÄ la pratique de la peinture, de la teinture & des autres arts coloristes.

","This translation was made from the 1738 English translation of the <i>Elemens<i>. As such, it contains the corrections Hanna made in his English edition and the properly labeled figures. Voltaire's <i>Elemens<i> of 1738 was immediately recognized for its clarity of presentation, fidelity, and effective targeting of an educated but non-mathematic public. Though Newtonian natural philosophy had found its way into British universities, there were very few popularizations in English and so Hanna's translation was widely read. He added his own comments throughout the translation; which are usually just single sentences of further explication.
","Italian translation of the the <i>Elemens<i> of 1738. Included is a new table of contents and material on tides that had appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society of London. This is Voltaire's summary and popularization of Newtonian natural philosophy, covering optics and gravity. The chapters on optics (172 pages) include: light's nature and propagation, with a history and an attack on Descartes and Malebranche; reflection and refraction; eye and eye-function, refraction in the eye; telescopes; visual perception of distance, size, shape, and orientation; cause and consequences of refraction; colors and differing refraction; the rainbow; colors from thin plates and solid objects; prime colors and music scales.","‚ÅÇ <i>Voltaire.

The result of extensive study on his part, the atlas has an unusual format: an illustrated survey of arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry and analysis, applied to the practical sciences, in 68 engraved plates. Each contains a central graphic, accompanied by engraved lettered explanation on each side. The content shows the influence of the work of Christian von Wolff and his <i>Anfangs-GruÃànde aller Mathematischen Wissenschaften<i> in the choice of the applied subjects.¬†It is known that Mayer studied with the instrument maker and optician Georg Brander while in Augsburg and Brander likely deepened Mayer's optical knowledge. The atlas presents no new information but signals how wide Mayer's reading and study was, and indicates the range and level of information available in mathematics and natural philosophy to the autodidact of the time. This copy contains an additional 8 Tables in a supplement at the end.
","Concise, graphical encyclopedia of Mixed Mathematics, including:  arithmetic, geometry, logarithms, plane and spherical trigonometry, mensuration, surveying instruments and methods, cartography, astronomy and cosmography, horography, military and civil architecture, optics and perspective, mechanics, presented in 60 plates. In addition, 8 plates present a mathematical supplement of problems and examples, including the calculus. The three optics tables cover: structure of the eye, eye-function, catoptrics of plane and curved mirrors, dioptrics of convex and concave lenses, the telescope. Table three of the supplement deals with conic sections and is related back to optics. The treatment is elementary and graphical-descriptive, clear and detailed.","Tobias Mayer (1723-62): A Case of Forgotten Genius|Forbes, E.G.|<i>British Journal for the History of Science<i>, Vol 5, No 1, 1970, pp 1-20.||<i>Tobias Mayer, (1723-62), pioneer of enlightened science in Germany<i>|Forbes, E.G.|Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, Gottingen, 1980, pp 248.",****,"Mathematischer atlas, in welchern auf 60 tabellen alle theile der mathematic vorgestellet; und nicht allein uÃàberhaupt zu bequemer wiederholung, sondern auch den anfaÃàngern besonders zur aufmunterung durch deutliche beschreibung u. figuren entworfen werden.

The preface to the first edition of the <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> dated 1719 and the unfinished preface to the 1742 edition are included in the translation. The engravings of the 1742 Latin edition were used to print the plates for this translated edition. Editions of the French translation appeared at Leiden in 1745 and 1746, and at Paris in 1747. Elie de Joncourt also produced a French translation of Pemberton's <i>A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy<i> in 1755.

"Ferrari, Girolamo OFM","Girolamo Ferrari, OFM",Forutnato da Brescia,Also Known As: Forutnato da Brescia,1701-1754,,," ",Philosophia Sensuum Mechanica,"An expanded teaching manual covering General and Particular Physics.","Second, expanded edition of the work of 1735. The first edition was in two volumes, this edition is in four volumes. A textbook describing 'those things which are observed by the senses.' By the time Ferrari wrote this, his thinking had evolved away from Scholastic Aristotelianism and had aligned with the natural philosophy of Gassendi, parts of Descartes and Malebranche, and the optics (but not the gravity) of Newton. In many sections, particularly those on optics and the physics of light, a summary history is given ranging from the ideas of Epicurus and Aristotle, through Descartes and Malebranche, to Huygens and Newton. The textbook shows that though Ferrari had moved away from most of the physics of Descartes and presents that of Newton, he continued to assume a fundamental mechanistic basis of physics and was unwilling to grant that (merely) the predictive accuracy of Newton's equation was evidence of the reality that was hypothesized to underlie them. In this sense, Ferrari's text is an example of the bridging that was taking place between Cartesian and Newtonian ideas. Widely used throughout Europe, the textbook was, for example, recommended as the physics text for use at the University of Seville in 1768. Editions appeared at Brexia in 1735, 1745, and 1751, posthumously at Venice in 1756, 1761, and in the Opera Omnia of 1792.
","A teaching manual covering General and Particular Physics. General Physics includes: nature of bodies; motion; light and color; sound; touch; smell; motion of fluids and solids under gravity. Particular Physics includes: the heavens and the earth; meteorics; living organisms; the senses; human anatomy. The optics section of volume 1 (98 pages, the physics of light) includes: the aether and the wave nature of light; propagation of light; opaque and transparent materials; reflection of light and mirrors; refraction of light and lenses; dispersion; color. The optics section of volume 4 (57 pages, vision) includes: vision; ocular anatomy; direct vision; principles of reflected vision and catoptrics; principles of refracted vision and dioptrics including spectacles, the microscope, and the telescope. Done in the Scholastic style, with definitions, propositions, proofs, discussions, and corollaries. The presentation is detailed, geometric, and supported with many figures. The optics material in the second edition is more concise than in the first; there are fewer digressions, considerably less space devoted to history, and fewer references to authorities. There is more emphasis on and space devoted to experiments and discussion of their results. The style and presentation remains the same.","The Tranditional Currents of Thought|Garin, E.|In: History of Italian Philosophy, Brill Rodopi, 2008, 1373 pp, NB: pp 749-762.||Fortunato da Brescia|Baldini, U.|In: <i>Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani<i>, Vol 49, 1977.|http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/fortunato-da-brescia_(Dizionario-Biografico)/",****,"Philosophia Sensuum Mechanica.

","French translation of the second edition of Hauksbee‚Äôs <i>Physico-mechanical Experiments<i> of 1719. The manuscript of the translation was found in Francois De Bremond's papers after his death. Desmarest reorganized the material, added a considerable number of notes, and saw the work through the press. Desmarest's extensive notes are particularly interesting for their explanation of Hauksbee's experiments and what can be interpreted from their results. The work received a 9-page very favorable review and summary in the Journal des Scavans of April 1756. The reviewer remarks: 'The notes and additions of M. Desmarest are printed in characters so minute and so tight that they could be used in another form to fill a considerable volume.' 
","Francois De Bremond's text is a translation of the posthumous second edition of the <i>Physico-Mechanical Experiments<i> of 1709. Hauksbee's book presents experiments and resulting propositions regarding electricity and the generation of 'barometric light', sometimes referred to as 'mercurial light.'  These experiments involved partial vacuum, static electricity, and what is now recognized as electro-luminescence of low-pressure discharges. The experiments and apparatus are described in great detail, with elaborate engraved figures. Taken together, the discussions present a theory of electricity and established a source of light that challenged current theories about the nature of light. Hauksbee used an air pump of his own design and construction to evacuate rotatable glass globes and cylinders, creating 'a fine purple light' inside them by rubbing the outside surface. The light would disappear gradually when air was let into the vessels, but at atmospheric pressure, rubbing (and so electrifying) the glass would enable it to attract woolen threads, etc. Hauksbee reports a series of experiments in optics, some of them concerning the refraction indices for a variety of substances, as measured by Snell‚Äôs law. In one such experiment he determined the indices for common air, vacuum and compressed air, using a hollow prism as well as an air pump and a condensing engine. He also developed a special instrument, made up of the prism, a stopcock, a gauge and a telescope. The supplement (100 pages) contained in this edition adds experiments to measure the refractive power of liquids, attempts to generate mercurial light with sulfur and metals, and other experiments involving specific gravity, electrostatics, and capillarity. The extensive added in the form of notes by Desmarest make this essentially a new work.","‚ÅÇ Francis Hauksbee and his air pump|Brundtland, T.|<i>Notes and Records of The Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 66, 2012, pp 253-272.||Early Electricity between Chemistry and Physics: The Simultaneous Itineraries of Francis Hauksbee, Samuel Wall, and Pierre Polini√®re|Freudenthal, G.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 2, 1981, pp 203-229.||Francis Hauksbee's theory of electricity|Home, R.W.|<i>Archive for History of Exact Sciences<i>, Vol 4, No 3, 1967, pp 203‚Äì217.",****,"Experiences physico-mechaniques sur diffeÃÅrens sujets, et principalement sur la lumiere et l'electriciteÃÅ, produites par le frottement des corps.

Unlike the furor caused by Giovanni Rizzetti's attack on Newton's optics, the <i>De Luminis Affectionibus<i> of 1727, Cominale's attack appears to have been ignored. To be expected, perhaps; by the middle of the 18th century, Newtonian optics was widely accepted in Italy. A century later in <i>A Budget of Paradoxes<i> the mathematician Augustus De Morgan would quip regarding Cominale's work: 'The first volume upsets the theory of light; the second vacuum, <i>vis inertiae<i>, gravitation, and attraction. I confess I never attempted these big Latin volumes, numbering 450 closely-printed quarto pages. The man who slays Newton in a pamphlet is the man for me. But I will lend them to anybody who will give security, himself in ¬£500, and two sureties in ¬£250 each, that he will read them through, and give a full abstract; and I will not exact security for their return. I have never seen any mention of this book: it has a printer, but not a publisher, as happens with so many unrecorded books.' The third volume, included here, is exceedingly rare and dated 1769.
","An exposition and attack on Newtonian optics in 15 chapters. Chapters 1-4: nature of light; propagation, refraction, and reflection of light. Chapters 5-8: Newton's theory of color, its exposition, its refutation. Chapter 9: A new theory of Color. Chapters 10-13: Newton's experimental results shown to be wrong by new, counter experiments. Chapter 14: The rainbow. Chapter 15: Permanent colors. The first four chapters are an elementary presentation of light and its properties. The remaining chapters attempt to refute the idea that white light or sunlight is an inhomogeneous compound of diverse colors. The new theory of color that is offered is a modification of Malenbranche's Cartesian idea of modified size and vibration of light particles. Following Giovanni Rizzetti, Cominale reported experiments and described results that refuted Newton's experiments with prismatic refraction and dispersion. These experiments are either difficult to understand or have results that have clearly been misinterpreted.","The Reception of Newtonian Optics in Italy|Casini, P.|In: <i>Renaissance and Revolution: Humanists, Scholars, Craftsmen and Natural Philosophers<i>|Cambridge University Press, 1993, pp 215-228.",****,"Anti-Newtonianismi Pars Prima, In qua Newtoni de coloribus systema ex propriis principiis geometrice evertitur, et nova de coloribus theoria luculentissimis experimentis demonstratur.

Deneke, based solely on a listing of new books in volume 84 of the <i>Neue Genealogisch-Historische Nachrichten<i>, 'New Genealogical Historical News', of 1757 from publisher Johann Samuel Heinius. It lists the book as being available at the Leipzig 'Jubilate-Messe"" (Spring trade fair) that year in Heinius' bookshop.||The title page shows only 'C.L.D.' as the author. The book was reviewed anonymously in the Gottingische Anzeigen of June 1757 and very negatively by Abraham K√§stner in the Hamburgisches Magazin for 1757. Deneke's book is an elaborate compilation of material on many topics in optics from many sources--often quoted at length, without comment or assessment. Fifty-five authors and works are cited as references. The central interest is the utility and application of optics; the work presents almost no theory, but an abundance of detail is supplied regarding some aspects of optical instruments. As the list of contents shows, the structure is scattered and appears driven by the source Deneke accessed, rather than any specific plan. A strange book without any apparent influence.
","An attempt at a comprehensive compendium of optics. The book is in three parts. Part I Optics: the eye and eye function, optical experiments, optical instruments, anamorphosis, anamorphic adjustment of images in a plane, in a cone, and in a pyramid. Part II Catoptrics: mirrors, material and forms of mirrors, plane mirrors and experiments, anamorphosis with plane mirrors, spherical mirrors, concave and convex mirrors, preparing and polishing mirrors, mirror experiments, anamorphosis and curved mirrors. Part III Dioptrics: refraction, figuring and polishing lenses and prisms and menisci, experiments with images and foci, the microscope and objective lenses, compound microscope, telescopes, helioscopes, periscopes, micrometers, camera obscura, experiments, the magic lantern. The material, though detailed, is elementary and descriptive; no mathematics of any kind is used. Much of the material, all the tables of data, and most of the figures are simply copied from other sources.","Neue Genealogisch-Historische Nachrichten, neunzehntn bandes viertes stuck, 1757, pp 408-428.

Tosca wrote for his students, and the style and clarity of the books benefited from his long practice in teaching. The nine volumes are meant to cover all of mathematics and philosophy: I Arithmetic and Geometry, II Algebra and music, III Trigonometry and conics, IV Statics and Hydrostatics, V Civil and Military Architecture, VI Optics and Meteorics, VII Astronomy, VIII Geography and Navigation, IX Gnomics and Astrology. Tosca's textbooks were widely used and responsible, in part, for the introduction of modern science in Spain. The volumes of the first edition appeared at Valentia between 1707 and 1715. It was reprinted in Madrid in 1727 and 1757.
","The first teaching compendium of natural philosophy in Castilian. Volume six contains five sections on optics and meteorics, treatises XVIII - XXII. Section I Optics: general considerations and definitions; nature and propagation of light; nature of colors; transparent and opaque bodies; view and vision; eye-function; perception of size and shape; binocular vision. Section II Perspective: principles, iconographic and orthographic projection; methods for representing objects in various orientations; linear perspective; perspective of light, shadow, and reflected bodies; perspective of curved surfaces. Section III Catoptrics: general considerations an definitions; plane mirrors and their properties; convex and concave mirrors; cylindrical mirrors; spherical mirrors, caustics. Section IV Dioptrics:  refraction and its effects; cause and properties of refraction; location of refracted images; refractive glasses and their properties; combining refracting bodies; convex lenses, concave lenses; refraction and the generation of colors. Section V Meteorics: the sea and the wind; atmosphere and clouds, all type of precipitation; lighting; lights generated in the air; the rainbow; other forms of light; comets. Though the basis is essentially Cartesian, also cited are Grimaldi, Kircher, Scheiner, Zahn, Dechales, Rheyta, Zucchi, but not Huygens (1690) or Newton (1704). The wave and corpuscular theories of the nature of light are presented, but each is considered unproven. Color theory follows Pardies and is a hybrid of Aristotelian and Cartesian.

Porterfield has extensive knowledge of ophthalmological history, quoting widely from previous authors and correcting several errors then lingering in ophthalmological books. He is also aware of then-current and latest information; this is particularly the case regarding the nature of light and colors. Porterfield reports many of his original experiments and results on visual physiology, which advanced that field considerably. Importantly, he argued against the too-extensive use of the analogy of the eye as a camera obscura: the Mind does not see the images on the retina. Porterfield also did important work in accommodation, eye movement, visual pathways and binocular vision. He utilized an experiment of Scheiner to create the optometer, an instrument used to determine the eye's focal distance. These were the many reasons why Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz would later cite the great usefulness of Porterfield's book.

Book III Vision: nature and properties of light; ocular optics; adaptation; pupil motion; function of the retina and optic nerve. Book IV Animal eyes: differing placements and structures. Book V Visual Perception: two eyes resulting in a single perception; erect appearance of objects; color of objects; size of objects; distance of objects; orientation of objects; shape of objects; motion of objects. Many sections begin with a general review and consideration of past works and their authors; Porterfield is clearly knowledgeable of the history of ophthalmology, theories of light and color, and geometric optics.

This is an attempt to relate the amount and distribution of reflected light to the physical and optical properties of surfaces. Book III: Research on transparent and opaque bodies. Presents the law of exponential decay of light in absorbing transparent bodies of constant and varying densities. Book II is filled with lacunae which De La Caille left unfilled. Generally they are places Bouguer intended to fill with experimental results; making Book little more than a description of Bouguer's plan to gather data about reflectance of polished and rough surfaces and how it might be used to build a computational model of such reflections.

","This is a printing of a dissertation defended under the direction of Carolo Benvenuti in Rome in 1754. This dissertation was actually written by Benvenuti and Rudjer Bo≈°koviƒá, Benvenuti's teacher. It was one of two dissertations that finally prompted Jesuit superiors to attempt to suppress Bo≈°koviƒá's ideas by removing Benvenuti from his teaching position in the Collegium Romanum.
","The dissertation is in four sections. I: The inherent properties of light. II: Colors exhibited by thin, clear plates and the alternate reflection and transmission which rays undergo. III: Colors from thick plates and the nature of their dependence. IV: Colors of natural bodies, or, the nature of light the properties of its cause. The fundamental Newtonian notions of light as emitted particles and the chromatic heterogeneity of white light is adopted, but Rudjer Bo≈°koviƒá's notion of local attractive and repulsive forces acting over exceedingly small distances between atoms is used to explain the colors produced by thin and thick plates and from the surfaces of objects.

"Euler, Leonhard",Leonhard Euler,," ",1707-1783,,," ",Constructio lentium obiectivarum ex duplici vitro,"Euler addresses the problem of simultaneously minimizing chromatic and spherical aberration in telescope lenses.","Euler provoked Newtonians with his paper 'Sur la Perfection des Verres Objectifs des Lunettes,' published by the Royal Academy at Berlin in 1747. It stated that, contrary to Newton's claim, telescope lenses could be constructed that did not exhibit chromatic aberration. This was the basis for Euler's later and more extensive work on lenses that minimized chromatic and spherical aberration, and was first submitted by Jacobi to the Berlin Academy in 1761 but it was never published in its memoirs. Euler submitted the work to the St. Petersburg Academy for its prize question regarding the perfection of telescopes. By the time this paper was submitted, John Dollond had published his paper on his prism experiments and the making of his achromatic telescope lens. But reducing both spherical and chromatic aberration remained a difficult problem and it was that which Euler addressed in his submission to the St. Petersburg Academy.","Euler addresses the problem of simultaneously minimizing chromatic and spherical aberration in telescope lenses. Two lenses with differing indices of refraction could produce an achromatic telescope objective, but the great curvatures required increased spherical aberration. Euler derives equations that, given glass refractive indices, yield the size, curvature, and focal length of a two-lens telescope objective. The paper ends with four examples, worked out in detail, considering four different pairs of refractive indices, the last involving water and glass. An appendix gives the resulting simplifications if some of the constraints are relaxed or removed.","New Light on an Old Question: Who Invented the Achromatic Telescope?|Rudd, M.E., Jaecks, D.H., Willach, R., Sorrenson, R., and Abrahams, P.|<i>Journal of the Antique Telescope Society<i>, Vol 19, 2000, pp 3-12.",****,"Constructio lentium obiectivarum ex duplici vitro quae neque confusionem a figura sphaerica oriundam, neque dispersionem colorum pariant, Auctore Leonhardo Eulero.

"Scherffer, Karl",Karl Scherffer,," ",1716-1783,,," ",De Emendatione Telescopiorum Dioptricorum,"The first continental description of Dollond's two-lens telescope objective.
","A brief dissertation on the theory, function, and design of a telescope objective made from two lenses of differing indices of refraction. This was the first continental description of Dollond's two-lens telescope objective. Dollond's article <i>An Account of Some Experiments concerning the Different Refrangibility of Light<i> had appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1757. In it, Dollond describes repeating Newton's experiment regarding the inseparability of refraction and dispersion, and obtaining a different result than that reported by Newton in his Opticks of 1704. Taking this new result as a basis for correcting chromatic aberration, Dollond built a two-lens telescope objective with water between the lenses. Dollond's objective significantly reduced chromatic aberration. It is this work that Sherffer summarizes, adds to, and explains. This Latin text was the basis for Scherffer's <i>Neue Verbesserung dioptrischer Fernr√∂hren<i> that appeared at Leipzig in 1764.
","The dissertation describes the Dollond two-glass telescope objective of convex and concave lenses of differing indices of refraction. An analysis is provided of the displacement of focal lengths for limiting red and violet rays, which in turn provides an estimate of the residual chromatic blur. Examples using typical lens sizes, curvatures, and indices of refraction are worked out in detail. References are made to the work of Boscovich and Clairaut on the problem of designing achromatic objectives.","Dollond & Son's Pursuit of Achromaticity, 1758‚Äì1789|Sorrenson, R.|<i>History of Science<i>,Vol 39, No 1, 2001, pp 31-55.",****,"De emendatione telescopiorum dioptricorum per vitrum objectivum compositum recens a Dollondo in Anglia inventa, dissertatio conscripta a P.

","By 1746 the Amsterdam publisher Isaac Tirion had produced a Dutch translation of John Desagulier's compendium of experimental natural philosophy. As it lacked any significant optics, the Dutch translator (never identified, but Jacobus Krighout (1703-1770) has been suggested), proposed a third volume: a Dutch translation of part of Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738: the 'Popular Treatise.' Tirion's and the translator's plans eventually expanded to include publication of a translation of Smith's entire work. The list of 176 subscribers in the front matter is evidence of the keen interest of the Dutch in Smith's detailed optical treatise. Dutch interest in optical matters in general and telescopes in particular was responsible, in part, for the popularity, success, and influence of the book. The Dutch translation appeared at Amsterdam in 1753 and reissued with a new title page at The Hague in 1764.

","A reprinting of Rudjer Bo≈°koviƒá's <i>De Lumine<i> of 1748, written while he was at the Collegio Romano. The text appeared is more than one form. The Pars Prima first appeared as a dissertation written by Bo≈°koviƒá but defended by (future Cardinal) Andrea Archetti in the Collegio Romano and printed in August 1748. The <i>Pars Secunda<i> was defended in the Collegio Romano and published anonymously in September of 1748. The work is a vigorous proposal and defense of the idea that light is corpuscular and subject to local, point-source attractive and repulsive forces which result in reflection, refraction, and diffraction. The Dissertatio de Lumine shows the earliest development and expression of Bo≈°koviƒá's ideas regarding point-source forces on (in the present case) light. These investigations into optics, particularly refraction, posed  long-standing explanatory problems of cause and origin that had had no solution. To that end, Boscovich proposes a force law that first appears in the <i>Dissertatio de Lumine<i> of 1748. An early version of the famous oscillating plot of repulsive and attractive force appears here. These ideas would eventually be refined and developed and appear in his <i>Philosophiae Naturalis Theoria<i> of 1758. The edition of 1766 of the <i>Dissertatio De Lumine<i> is the first time both parts appeared together under  Bo≈°koviƒá's name. The volume also contains a reprinting of Carolo Benvenuti's <i>Dissertatio Physica de Lumine<i> of 1761.
","The <i>Dissertatio de Lumine<i> presents a view of physical optics, that is, the nature of light, which for Bo≈°koviƒá  means light as particles, moving with finite speed, subject to forces from the matter with which it interacts, and with all changes in speed and direction of propagation obeying the law of continuity. Bradley's 1727 discovery and explanation of stellar aberration supported the ideas that light is an emitted stream of particles and that is travels with a finite speed.  Using then-available data, Bo≈°koviƒá calculates the speed of light to be something close to the modern accepted value--though his calculation benefited from compensating inaccuracies of astronomical distances and times. It is here that Bo≈°koviƒá proposes extending Bradley's experiment by using a telescope filled with water and thus allowing the determine of the speed of light in water. In Pars Secunda, reflection, refraction, diffraction, and chromatic dispersion are explained in terms of light particles, traveling at finite speeds, reacting to the attractive and repulsive forces from point-sources that comprise the matter with which they interact. This is the first application of the Bo≈°koviƒá's attractive/repulsive force law/","The Reception of a Theory: A Provisional Syllabus of Boscovich Literature, 1746-1800|Baldini, U.|In: <i>The Jesuits II: Cultures, Sciences, and the Arts, 1540-1773<i>|O'Malley SJ, J.W., Bailey, G.A., Harris, S.J., and Kennedy SJ, T.F., editors|University of Toronto Press, 2006, pp 408-508.",****,"Dissertatio de Lumine.

It was one of two dissertations that finally prompted Jesuit superiors to attempt to suppress Bo≈°koviƒá's ideas by removing Benvenuti from his teaching position in the Collegium Romanum.
","The dissertation is in four sections. I: The inherent properties of light. II: Colors exhibited by thin, clear plates and the alternate reflection and transmission which rays undergo. III: Colors from thick plates and the nature of their dependence. IV: Colors of natural bodies, or, the nature of light the properties of its cause. The fundamental Newtonian notions of light as emitted particles and the chromatic heterogeneity of white light is adopted, but Rudjer Bo≈°koviƒá's notion of local attractive and repulsive forces acting over exceedingly small distances between atoms is used to explain the colors produced by thin and thick plates and from the surfaces of objects.

","Esprit P√©zenas's translation and augmentation of Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738. This is one of several French translations of major British works in mathematics and optics that P√©zenas produced, contributing significantly to the diffusion of English science in France. At the end of the second volume, P√©zenas added considerable material that described developments in optics made since Smith's original was published. Two French translations of Smith's work appeared in 1767: Esprit P√©zenas' being more concerned with the theoretical aspects while Duval-le-Roy's had a heavy emphasis on the practical, lens and instrument aspects. P√©zenas' translation was reviewed very positively in the Journal des S√ßavans for July, September, and December of 1767, with the December number focusing on the new material provided by P√©zenas. This translation was published at Avignon and at Paris.
","P√©zenas keeps the structure and content of Smith's original text of 1738, and though not a slavishly literal translation, it does keep closely to Smith sense and style. In addition to comments and clarifications of Smith's text throughout the translation, P√©zenas appended 'Additions du Traducteur' at the end of the second volume, totaling 127 pages and six additional plates of figures. The additions cover: 1: Experiments conducted to determine the limits of distinct and indistinct vision. 2: Why the field of view of two eyes is greater than that of one; 3: Achromatic lenses. 4: Catadioptric Sector. 5: Solar Microscope. 6: Euler's method for perfecting magic lanterns and solar microscopes. 7: A new method to very easily measure star positions. 8: Nutation of the earth's axis of rotation. 9: Movement of the sun around its axis. 10: Angle determination with a micrometer. 11: Determining the vertical diameters of the sun and planets. 12: An astronomical quadrant. Most of the additions are translations from brief articles that had appeared in journals outside France. The exception is the third on achromatic lenses, which is the longest by far and a very detailed, highly mathematical consideration of then-recent developments regarding achromatic lenses, multiple glass telescope objectives, the work done to determine their design. The work of Newton, Zucchi, Klingenstierna, Mallet, Dollond, Euler, and Clairaut are quoted or summarized.

"Bo≈°koviƒá, Rudjer Josip",Rudjer Josip Bo≈°koviƒá,"Boscovich, Ruggero","Also Known As: Boscovich, Ruggero",1711-1787,,," ",Memorie sulli cannocchiali diottrici,"A reworking and updating of Boscovich's 1756 work giving a complete analysis of lenses used primarily as objectives for telescopes. The updating includes consideration of Dollond's telescope achromatic objective lens.
","The basis of this work is Boscovich's dissertation on telescope lenses of 1756. At that time he was unaware of the developments in achromatic telescope lenes presumably  from the time of his journey to France and England he learned knew about Dollond's work published in 1758. And presumably on his return journey from Constantinopole while visiting Vienna a second time, from January to May 1763, he saw Clairaut‚Äôs dissertations on achromatic lenses that had appeared in 1761 and 1762. While in Rome, towards the end of 1763, he happened upon Klingenstierna's demonstration of 1761 that contrary to Newton's assertion, achromatic lens systems were theoretically possible.||Boscovich's subsequent work on achromatic lenses was reported in his his two dissertations <i>De recentibus compertis pertinentibus ad perficiendam Dioptricam<i> and <i>De unione colorum aliorum post alios per binas substantias, ac unione multo majore per tres<i> that appeared in the Commentarii Accademia di Bologna of 1767. Since producing those two dissertations, Boscovich had become director of the new Jesuit astronomical observatory at Brera near Milan. He wrote the current work while in Milan. Boscovich's letter to the reader makes clear is intent for this work: He wished to provide convenient design methods for producing achromatic simple telescope objectives and eye-pieces. Boscovich separated the first general overview (for 'those who had only a very subtle hint of geometry') from the second part with its more rigorous demonstrations.||This dissertation describes the state of the art of telescope lens analysis and design soon after the development of the achromatic telescope objective. It is clear from this and his earlier work, that the importance of knowing the index of refraction of materials emerges as a central issue of practical optics for Boscovich. This dissertation is important in that it offers simplified lens design procedures for achromatic telescope objects as well as other off-axis aberrations. This would be that last important optical  work produced by Boscovich before the dissolution of the Jesuits in 1773 and and his move to Paris.
","A complete analysis of lenses used primarily as objectives for telescopes. The work is in two parts. The first is titled 'Elementary Information on the Nature and Principal Properties of Dioptric Telescopes'.  gives the general properties and characteristics of telescope objective lenses, defining the requirements for distinction, clarity, magnification, and field of view. The general principals are applied to the practical problem of a simple, two element objective. The second part is titled 'Clarification, and Demonstrations of Various more Essential Points from the First Part '. It consists of three sections, each giving proofs and detailed derivations or demonstrations of the components in Part One. Boscovich points out the need for achromatic eye-pieces since even for reflecting telescopes, eye-pieces will introduce chromatic aberration.||Material includes: refraction at spherical glass surfaces; real and virtual images; equations relating lens curvature and foci for convex and concave figures; equations applied to lens design, examples; spherical and chromatic aberrations and their quantification; optics of the eye and eye-function; ocular images and lenses; ocular images, lenses, and the uses of telescopes; consequences of lens aberrations and their effect on astronomical observations. Though the theoretical work of Clairaut, Klingenstierna, and Boscovich furnished the basis for designing and producing achromatic objective lenses and eyepieces, the greatest impediment, from the practical point of view, was that of the unavailability of English flint glass.","R.

"Pluche, Noel Antoine",Noel Antoine Pluche,," ",1688-1761,,," ",Spectacle de la Nature,"A vast summary and consideration of natural science and philosophy. Immensely successful in 18th century France and throughout Europe.
","One of the great works in natural history in the 18th century. Though a work of a different type and style, Pluche's <i>Le Spectacle de la Nature<i> was as widely read as Buffon's <i>Histoire Naturelle<i>. Pluche wrote the <i>Le Spectacle<i> specifically for the young; to make them aware of the world around them, its natural and man-made wonders. It is in this sense that Pluche uses <i>Spectacle<i>. As Pluche worte: People don‚Äôt know how a windmill works or a watch . . . . but they spend a lot of time on quadrille or discussing monads of Leibniz. Particularly  important is Pluche's extensive treatment of the arts and crafts and his clear commitment to increase esteem for artisans and the mechanical arts. But Pluche's work is teleological, though in a milder, more pietistic form; unlike, say, the <i>Het Regt Gebruik der Werelt Beschouwingen<i> of Bernard Nieuwentyt. Nevertheless, the teleology of the work, and Pluche's rejection of Enlightenment thought likely account for the disaffection and his relative oblivion.  Pluche nevertheless deserves credit for reviving the study of natural history in France.||The style is that of a series of dialogues and letters  between the young knight of Breuil, the count and countess Jonval, the prior of Jonval. In his Preface, Pluche says this style of presentation is far better than '... a continuous speech, or a series of dissertations which often lead to disgust & boredom.'||The printing history of <i>Le Spectacle<i> is quite tangled. The initial volume appeared in 1732 and was reissued 3 times within 6 months. The remaining 8 volumes that define the complete work appeared between 1732 and 1751. Between 1732 and 1768, various volumes of Le Spectacle de la Nature were issued in at least 18 editions. Two abridgements and translations into English, Italian, Spanish, and German also appeared. The more than 200 plates were  engraved in intaglio by Jacques-Philippe Le Bas (1707-1783). This is a posthumous edition.","This edition includes the material in the original 7 volumes plus two on the sky and the heavens. The material on mechanics, machines, and optics in in Volume V||Volume I: Animals and Plantes, Insects, Birds; Volume II: Surface and Interior of the Earth, Part I, plants, gardens; Volume III: Surface and Interior of the Earth, Part II, plants, boats, and fish; Volume IV: The Heavens and Parts of the Universe, with numerous maps; Volume V: Man considered in himself, Mathematics and machines; Volume VI: Man and Society, Trades; Volume VII: Man and Society, Typography, Crafts; Volume VIII: Man and Society with God, Part I; Volume IX: Man and Society with God, Part II.||Pluche introduced into his physics elementary substances as foundational elements; particularly important was light. Pluche considered the Book of Genesis, in which light was created before the sun and starts, and so held that light was one of several elementary substances--the finest and first-created of the elements and notably distinct from fire.  Pluch held that 'the nature of light is an inconceivable marvel, a true abyss in which our spirit does not play any other part than admiring and adoring.' For Pluche, light is a fluid that fills the entire universe and without changing place it transmits the actions of the sun. Light is always around us, but it has to be 'shaken' by the sun or a lamp to activate vision.","√âcrire la nature au XVIIIe si√®cle: autour de l'abb√© Pluche|Gevrey, F.|Presses de l'Universit√© Paris-Sorbonne, 2006, 406 pp.||<i>Les sciences de la nature en France, au xviii siecle.

"Guyot, Edm√© Gilles",Edm√© Gilles Guyot,," ",1706-1786,,," ",Nouvelles reÃÅcreÃÅations physiques et matheÃÅmatiques,"The most popular book of recreational mathematics published in the second half of the 18th century.","The most popular book of recreational mathematics published in the second half of the 18th century. Dilettante interest in science by polite society at this time was widespread in Europe. Lectures and books that presented aspects of physics and mathematics by demonstrations, games, tricks, and instruments as entertainments were very popular. Guyot wrote directly to this audience, stating in his Discours Pr√©liminaire that he 'preferred to compose recreations that were as easy in execution as they were surprising in effect, so that those who only want recreation and have difficulty studying, can increase their understand while relaxing.' In this Guyot's Recreations are different from Ozanam's which through their many editions never lost their serious didactic purpose. Guyot's <i>Recreations<i> are simpler, more accessible, more fun. The plates of figures were hand colored. The first edition appeared in 1769-1770 in four volumes, and this second edition, enlarged from the first, appeared in four volumes in 1772, 1773, 1774, 1775. A third edition appeared at Paris in 1786, which was reprinted in  1799. Translations appeared in Dutch at Rotterdam in 1771-1775, in German at Augsburg in 1772-1775, and English at London in 1774.
","Guyot presents 'Recreations'--that is, demonstrations, phenomena, games, and instruments based on aspects of physics and mathematics. Eight parts are grouped in four volumes. Volume 1: part 1 covers magnets and their many applications; part2 covers numerical mathematics, combinations and permutations, and anagrams. Volume 2: part 3 covers geometry, light, optics, vision and perspective; part 4 covers electricity. Volume 3: part 5 coverts magnetics and new applications; part 6 coverts catoptrics and dioptrics. Volume 4: part 7 covers mechanical games, 'occult', water and fire; part 8 covers fire, phosphorous and chemistry, electricity, magic squares. The optics material in in part 6 (190 pages). There are 44 'Recreations' covering the catoptric and dioptric phenomena, instruments, perspective, and anamorphosis. The catoptric recreations include: Images in plane, convex and concave mirrors; multiple mirrors and interreflected image; anamorphosis and deformed images by deformed mirrors; conical mirrors; images in spherical mirrors. The dioptric recreations include: camera obscura; magic lanterns; images from lenses; shadows. Each recreation is presented as an entertainment based on an optical phenomenon. The presentations are purely demonstrative, with figures accompanying some of the recreations, showing the optical effect or, in some few cases, indicating how it is accomplished. There is no theory or mathematics  presented. Generally, the reader is introduced to the most basic of optical principles of reflection and refraction by way of description and a general figures. The recreations present sometimes ingenious applications of basic principles to produce visual effects.","‚ÅÇ R√©cr√©ations et math√©matiques mondaines au XVIII·µâ si√®cle: le cas de Guyot|Belhoste, B., Hazebrouck, D.|<i>Historia Mathematica<i>, Vol 41, No 4, 2014, pp 490‚Äì505.|At: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086014000779",****,"Nouvelles reÃÅcreÃÅations physiques et matheÃÅmatiques, contenant ce qui a eÃÅteÃÅ imagineÃÅ de plus curieux dans ce genre et ce qui se deÃÅcouvre journellement; Auxquelles on a joint les causes, leurs effets, la manieÃÄre de les construire et l'amusement qu'on en peut tirer pour eÃÅtonner et surprendre agreÃÅablement.

","s Gravesande helped found the <i>Journal litt√©raire de la Haye<i> in l713. It was a periodical of significance for twenty years in the history of science and in which 's Gravesande book reviews and essays. Those essays were reprinted by J.N.S. Allamand in the present work. Perhaps the two most famous being that on Perspective and that in which he broke his long-standing attachment to Newtonianism and adopted the Huygens-Leibniz concept of vis viva, affirming that ‚ÄúLa force d‚Äôun corps est proportionelle √† sa masse multipli√©e par le quarr√© de sa vitesse.‚Äù The second volume contains a 50-pages history of 's Gravesande's life and work. The work on perspective had been reviewed very positively by Johann Bernoulli in the <i>Acta Eruditorum<i> in 1711. 's Gravesande's work on perspective would later influence the British mathematician Brook Taylor's work on this subject.

Volume 2: Reprinting of <i> Introductio ad philosophiam, metaphysicam et logicam continens<i>, Introduction to Philosophy, containing metaphysics and logic, of 1736 and some unprinted essays on similar topics discovered by Allamand.||The essay on perspective is an early work of 1711 which was translated in English in 1724. The work is in two parts: An elaborate geometric treatment of perspective and a consideration of the use of the camera obscura in drawing. 's Gravesande first introduces a mathematical model for perspectival  representations and associated concepts. From this he developed his theory of perspective, which he then used to describe and prove the correctness of a number of constructions. The application of the theory to constructions--that is, particular physical settings--is particularly elaborate. This included an application to sundials. Thirty-one plates of figures are devoted to these topics.","‚ÅÇ The geometry of an art: the history of the mathematical theory of perspective from Alberti to Monge|Andersen, K.|Springer, New York, 2007, 814 pp, NB: pp 328‚Äì360.||The impeccable credentials of an untrained philosopher: Willem Jacob 's Gravesande's career before his Leiden professorship, 1688‚Äì1717|van Besouw, J.|<i>Notes Records of the Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 70, No 3, 2016, pp 231-249.",****,"Oeuvres philosophiques et matheÃÅmatiques de Mr G.

Student of K√§stner, Professor at the Universities of Helmstedt and Halle",,"Edited by Georg Simon Kl√ºgel (1739 - 1812) German mathematician, natural philosopher. Student of K√§stner, Professor at the Universities of Helmstedt and Halle",Geschichte und gegenwaÃàrtiger Zustand der Optik (a),"Georg Simon Kl√ºgel's German translation and augmentation of Joseph Priestley's history of optics in six parts, from Ancient Greece to 18th century optics.
","Joseph Priestley was prompted to write a history of optics after the critical and commercial success of his <i>History and Present State of Electricity<i> of 1767. The bibliography appended to his history of optics lists 265 titles of books and journals he assembled for study and consultation on the history of natural philosophy in general and optics in particular. Priestley adopted a method he described in the preface: 'I  have  adopted  the historical  method,  because  it  appears  to  me  to  have many obvious advantages over any other for my purpose; being peculiarly calculate to enlarge the attention, and to communicate knowledge with the greatest ease, certainty, and pleasure.' But Priestley's history is deeply tinctured with his assessments of past work, experiments, and theories; it is not an hitoriographically neutral chronology. This is implied in the remarkable fold-out chronological frontispiece ('Biographical Chart'), which lists workers who, as Priestly says: 'have most distinguished themselves by their discoveries relating to vision, light and colours'. Priestley knew little mathematics, so his ability to understand, assess, and intelligently summarize optics after Descartes was quite limited. This may account for the book's prolonged descriptions and quotations from other works--making tedious reading. From this and the figures it copied it is clear that the work is derivative, but Priestley's made no greater claim: 'Neither in this volume, nor in the history of electricity, shall I be found to have made a parade of quoting any author that I have not actually consulted.' The lack of concision and of mathematics likely contributed to the books critical and commercial failure. Nevertheless, the book was an important vehicle for knowledge of optics and vision; Priestley provided English translations of many important sections of works in other languages, and detailed many important ideas in optics and vision new in the 18th century.  A German translation appeared in 1776. There would not be another book-length general history of optics written until Giambattista Venturi's <i>Commentari Sopra la Storia e le Teorie dell'Ottica<i> of 1814.||Kl√ºgel makes clear his reasons for translating Priestley's work: It is the only generally available text that presents and optics history and, with a few exceptions, presents the most important ideas and authors. Kl√ºgel notes that Priestley is shy with his mathematics and that when it was thought necessary, it has been added or corrected. Kl√ºgel substitutes Johann Lambert's history of perspective for that of Priestley's and notes that he has reduced the number of figures in the final German text in order to make it more practical. Kl√ºgel marks his additions and corrections with an asterisk in the German text.
","Kl√ºgel translates Priestley's Preface and generally  produces a close translation, clearly marking his own changes. Priestly divides his optics history in six parts. Part 1: From Ancient Greece to 1600 (30 pages). Parts 2: The telescope, microscope, and the discoveries of Kepler and his contemporaries (70 pages). Part 3: Descartes, vision, optical instruments, 17th century optical experiments. Part 4: Between Descartes and Newton, vision, reflection, refraction, diffraction (100 pages). Part 5: Newtonian optics, theory of light and colors, colors from thin and thick plates, cause of reflection and refraction, Newton's telescope (110 pages). Part 6: 18th century optics, the nature of light, phosphors, refraction and dispersion, birefringence, vision, optical instruments (420 pages). The long quotations and extracts give Priestley's history the style and tone of a commonplace book, with entries placed chronologically. Only Priestley's abiding interest in vision and optical instruments intrudes. Mathematics is avoided entirely. The geometrical optics that is presented is quoted from Smith's Compleat System of Opticks of 1738, and physical optics centers around Boscovich's theory of point elements of matter surrounded by spheres of attractive and repulsive force which is used to explain reflection and refraction.||Kl√ºgel's work included editing, clarifying, and augmenting some of Priestley's more technical and less correct sections. These are either added notes or sections marked with an asterisk. Kl√ºgel also added a considerable section devoted to Johann Heinrich Lambert's Photometria of 1760; a book which Priestley knew of but claimed not to be able to acquire.","Joseph Priestley and The History of Optics: Historiography for Science Education|Moura, B.A.|In: <i>Proceedings of the IHPST 13th Biennial International Conference<i>|IHPST, 2015|At: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/279852019_Joseph_Priestley_and_The_History_of_Optics_Historiography_for_Science_Education||<i>The Enlightened Joseph Priestley, A Study of His Life and Work from 1773 to 1804<i>|Schofield, R.E.|The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, 1997, 196 pp, NB pp 138-143.||The Scientific Background of Joseph Priestley|Schofield, R.E.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 13, No 3, 1957, pp 148-163.||Joseph Priestleys Optik in Newtons Bahnen und die Darstellung des Regenbogens|Busch, W.|In: Verfeinertes Sehen, De Gruyter Oldenbourg, 2008, 253 pp, NB: pp 79-89.",****,"Dr. Joseph Priestlys Mitglied der KoÃànigl.

It was notable for its complete reliance on experiment and demonstration.","Joseph-Aignan Sigaud de Lafond was a student of Abbe Jean-Antoine Nollet and after Nollet's death succeeded him at the Coll√®ge Louis-le-Grand. He had acquired a deep understanding of the pedagogy of natural philosophy suitable for general audiences. The expulsion of the Jesuit from France in 1764 created an educational vacuum and Sigaud de Lafond began public lecturing and demonstrations. He assembled a famous experimental physics cabinet and in 1775 published a description of its contents and use. All of this was brought together in his four-volume survey of experimental natural philosophy published in 1777. It was notable for its complete reliance on experiment and demonstration, responding not only to the changing philosophical approach by professionals but also increased interest on the part of the public. Editions appeared in 1777 and 1787.
","Sigaud de Lafond's survey of natural philosophy is in four volumes. Volume 1: Section 1 Principles of bodies, coherence of their parts; Section 2 General properties of bodies; Section 3 Movement and repose. Volume 2: Section 4 Statics; Section 5 Hydrostatics; Section 6 Fluids. Volume 3: Section 7 Air; Section 8 Motion of air; Section 9 Air and animal economy; Volume 4: Section 10 Fire, light, and electricity; Section 11 Magnetism. The optics material (165 pages) in Section 10 includes the following. Optics: the nature of light, propagation; optics; light rays divergent and convergent; inverse-square of distance density; rays forming images in the eye. Dioptrics: refraction at surfaces; lenses; foci; spectacles; simple and compound microscopes; magic lantern; camera obscura; telescopes. Catoptrics: reflection, mirrors; convex and concave spherical mirrors; reflected images; colors; prismatic colors; object color; color mixing. The material is descriptive with little or no mathematics and is accompanied by numerous experiments to explain and demonstrate principles. Past and current authors are  extensively cited, with alternative theories presented and evaluated. Not only a summary of natural philosophy, the work can be considered a 'guide to the literature.'","<i>The Art of Teaching Physics: The Eighteenth-century Demonstration Apparatus  of Jean Antoine Nollet<i>|Pyenson, L., Gauvin, J.-F., editors|Les Editions du Septentrion, 2002, pp 22-27.",****,"EÃÅleÃÅmens de physique theÃÅorique et expeÃÅrimentale pour servir de suite aÃÄ la Description & usage d'un cabinet de physique expeÃÅrimentale, 2 vol. in 8‚Å∞, avec figures.

Appropriate experiments are cited in support of each claim made about the nature of light and heat.","This is the first scientific work Jean-Paul Marat published after his return to France from 11-year stay in England in 1776. Marat held that fire, light, and electricity were the manifestation of an elemental fiery fluid and conducted many experiments between 1777 and 1779  involving heat, electricity, and light. A report of Marat's work was presented to the French Academie Royale des Sciences with a positive response. Encouraged by this, Marat immediately wove his experimental results into a text, with the appropriate experiment cited in support of each claim, and had it published as this extended brochure. The title states it is the second edition, but it is actually a reprinting of the first edition which appeared earlier that same year. The wording in the title page regarding the status of the experiments is changed slightly ('experiments that have just been verified' to 'experiments that have been verified') and the text has been corrected by Marat in a few places. 
","Marat hypothesized that electrical phenomena were manifestations of an electrical fluid, that heat was an igneous fluid, and light a luminous fluid. The text weaves together 116 experiments demonstrating the nature of these fluids and their interaction. The most striking was a large objective lens admitting solar light into a camera obscura. Flames and heated objects were placed in the beam and projected images onto a distant wall. The optical inhomogeneities caused in the air were seen rising from any object placed in the beam's path. The following year Marat would publish another optical work with an etching depicting this--the first representation of what is now known as Schlieren.","Public Experiments and their Analysis with the Replication Method|Herring, P.|<i>Science & Education<i>, Vol 16, No 6, 2007, pp 637-645.||Du Marat In√©dit|Gottschalk, L.R., Connes, M.G.|<i>Annales historiques de la R√©volution francaise<i>, No 15, 1926, pp 209-216.||<i>Isaac Newton, Optique, Traduit de l‚Äôanglais par Jean-Paul Marat (1787)<i>|Blay, M.|Dunod, Paris, 2015, p 375, NB pp 50-69.||Jean-Paul Marat (1743-1793), cientista e tradutor de Newton|Tosi, L.|<i>Qu√≠mica Nova<i>, Vol 22, No 6, 1999, pp 907-912.|",****,"DeÃÅcouvertes de M.

As with other of his works, the <i>Dictionnaire Raisonn√© de Physique<i> was an important not for any original contribution but for the clarity and quality of presentation and the extent to which is was used in the study of physics. Brisson's work was among the first to use the new chemical terms of Lavoisier, Morveau, and Fourcroy. He makes clear in his Discours Preliminaire that he considers dictionairies as the best and surest way to help educate the public in matters of science, since dictionaries proved for immediate and easy look-up. In this regard, Brisson's entries are not just words and definitions, but usually concise dissertations or treatises that often use figures for clarity. Like his teacher Jean-Antoine Nollet, Brisson strove for clarity and teacherly effectiveness.||Editions appeared in 1781 and with additions and revisions in 1787, the later was reprinted at Paris in 1800.

The collection contains works that were most important, influential, and responsible for his contemporary reputation. The precise measurement of angular size, position, and separation was important in late 18th century for surveying, navigating, and astronomical work. A common method for determining longitude was the measurement of star position with respect to the moon, or the eclipses of the moons of Jupiter. Rochon ingeniously used birefringent crystals,  prisms, and mirrors to significantly extend the measurement range and improvement of accuracy of optical instruments in navigating and astronomy.
","The collection of memoires include the following. A new micrometer for objective lenses. Essay on the measure of small angles and the research on the achromatic lens. Research on the nature of light from the stars. Spherical glass surfaces. On the improvement of achromatic objectives. On Vision. Binocular vision. Improving Bouguer's Heliometer. Improving Hadley's quadrant. An instrument for the measurement of angles with great precision. An instrument for determining refraction and dispersion. A letter engraving machine. Achromatic lenses.

In 1775, Charles Joseph Panckoucke obtained the rights to reissue the work, and he published supplements and an index. But Panckoucke's plane was of larger scope. In the <i>Encyclop√©die<i>, the articles on individual topics were arranged alphabetically; Panckoucke wanted the material arranged by broad subject. His new schema has 26 divisions, among them: Mathematics, Physics, Medicine, Botany, Theology, Philosophy, Law, and Commerce. Each would have its own multivolume dictionary, including expanded versions of appropriate articles from the original <i>Encyclop√©die<i>, updated as necessary, and articles of new developments. The result was the <i> Encyclop√©die m√©thodique par ordre des mati√®res<i>, 'Methodical Encyclopedia by Order of Subject Matter.' The first volume (of Law) appeared in 1782.||The volumes in the division on mathematics were edited by  the Abb√© Bossut, a disciple of d'Alembert. Though D'Alembert had prepared more than half of the articles on pure mathematics for the original <i>Encyclop√©die<i>, his death in 1783 prevented him participating in the new work.||Before Panckouke's project was finished, this French imitation edition began to appear at Padua, published by the Seminary of Padua. The mathematical volumes appeared between 1787 and 1790; two volumes of text and one of plates. The publication of this imitation edition was continue for 10 years until Nepolean occupied Padua.","Generally, Bossut's reproduced the original articles on mathematics from the  original <i>Encyclop√©die<i> and its Supplement. The many new entries, corrections, and additions were usually the work of Bossut. Lalande was the sole author of the entries on astronomy. Condorcet, who had been entrusted by Panckoucke with the articles on mathematical analysis in the Supplement and had written many new studies for it, corrected many of these in the <i>Encyclopedie Methodique<i> and prepared several new ones.||In optics, there are entries on: optics, catoptrics, dioptrics, reflection, refraction, diffraction, double refraction, mirrors, lenses and their manufacture including achromatic lenses, telescopes, microscopes, light, atmospheric refraction, and the rainbow and other meteorological optical phenomena.","The Encyclopedie Methodique|Watts, G.B.|<i>PMLA<i>, Vol 73, No 4, 1958, pp 348-366.",****,"Encyclop√©die m√©thodique par ordre des mati√®res.

Regardless of light's ultimate nature, light rays are used as practical manifestations of its properties. Thus, the geometric optics material is ray-based, elementary, detailed and accompanied by examples and many figures.

","Johann Friedrich Lorenz wrote this textbook on pure and applied mathematics while senior teacher at the P√§dagogium (boarding high school) at Burg bei Magdeburg. Though written for high school use, German P√§dagogia had very high standards, and the content, level, and expectations of the text reflect that. It is designed for a student with no background, taking them through the mathematics up differential and integral calculus. The applied mathematics deals with several aspects of natural philosophy. This second edition was revised and enlarged considerably from the first, expanding from 2 to 3 three volumes. Editions appeared in 1785, 1793, and 1822.
","The second edition is in two parts in three Volumes. Part 1 is pure mathematics and is contained in volume 1, Part 2 is applied mathematics and is in volume 2 (mechanics and optics) volume 3 (astronomy). Volume 1: Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, stereometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, analysis, equations, functions, conics, differential equations, integral equations. Volume 2: Statics, hydrostatics, aerometry, mechanics, hydraulics, optics, perspective, catoptrics, dioptrics. Volume 3: Spherical astronomy, theoretical astronomy, geography, gnomics, chronology. The optics material (126 pages) includes: the nature of light, light rays and propagation, the eye and eye-function, reflection, plane and spherical mirrors, mirror images and foci and their calculation, other curved mirrors, theory of refraction, convex and concave lenses, refracted images and foci and their calculation, prismatic and object colors, the eye and spectacles, the telescope, the microscope, projectors.

The title is 'Encyclopedia', but the work is much more of a bibliography and reference to authors and their works. ","This work has its roots in Johann Georg  BuÃàsch's earlier work: <i>Encyclopedia of Historical and Philosophical and Mathematical Sciences<i> of 1775. The title is 'Encyclopedia', but the work is much more of a bibliography and reference to authors and their works.  BuÃàsch makes clear in his forward that the Encyclopedia was an expansion of the mathematical part of the previous work, augmented considerably and meant to update and replace Wolff's famous textbook. BuÃàsch notes that editions of the Wolff texts were only very slightly updated and stopped altogether in 1740. BuÃàsch relied on his own collection of books, which he considered to be very complete, and cites them extensively in the Encyclopedia. This adds to its importance, as it indicates what books were available and which were considered important regarding the sciences at the end of the 18th century.
","The material is covered in three sections, pure, applied, and mixed mathematics. Pure Mathematics: geometry, arithmetic, algebra and analysis, trigonometry. Applied Mathematics: mechanical science, optical science, acoustics and music, astronomical sciences, astrology and fortune telling (sic!), geography and hydrography, gnomics, chronology. Mixed Mathematics: civil architecture, military science. The optics material (33 pages) includes: the phenomenon of light, reflection and refraction, theories of propagation of light, the eye and eye-function, basic photometry, optical references, catoptrics, plane and spherical mirrors, catoptrical references, dioptrics, diffraction of light, catadioptrical telescopes, optical and lens craft, the microscope, dioptrical history and references.  The topics are mostly practical and are described in the most concise way possible. The text is little more than a framework to support the many references to authors and works in optics. There are no figures that accompany the optical material.","Zur Erinnerung an Johann Georg B√ºsch|Roscher, W.|Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Staatswissenschaft (Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics), Vol 23, No 2/3, 1867, pp. 219-241.",****,"EncyklopaÃàdie der mathematischen wissenschaften.

He devises an analysis of the attraction hypothesis that produces direct contradictions with Snell's Law and visual experience, and on this basis searches for a different cause of refraction.

This long-term project of Murhard's included the older works in mathematics and many related subjects, including bookkeeping, optics, physics, astronomy, navigation, hydraulics, mechanics, architecture, and fortifications.

Volumes 3 and 4 are devoted to mechanics. All of Volume 5 is devoted to the literature of optics. Murhard's bibliography is the first index of wide scope and temporal reach in mathematical and related works. Though now known to be somewhat inaccurate, the mathematician De Morgan mentions his indebtedness to Murhard's bibliography. It stands along side J.E.

"Wood, James",James Wood,," ",1760-1839,,," ",The Elements of Optics,"From a series of textbooks for university courses in mathematics and natural philosophy, this is the text on optics in that series and one of the few English texts in the 18th century devoted solely to optics","James Wood produced a series of textbooks for university courses in mathematics and natural philosophy between 1791-1799, <i>The Principles of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy<i>; six parts in four volumes. This is the text on optics in that series and one of the few English texts in the 18th century devoted solely to optics, the list of such texts is short: Smith in 1738, Benjamin Martin in 1740 and 1758, William Emerson in 1768, Harris posthumously in 1775, Higgins in 1776, and Woods in 1799. Wood's intention was not to produce a full compendium of optics, but rather a concise text that covered the elementary aspects of the subject and could be covered in a single university course. Editions of Wood's Optics appeared in 1799, 1801, 1811, and 1828.
","The material is covered in 13 chapters: The Nature of Light and its Propagation, Laws of Reflection, Laws of Refraction, Reflection at plane and spherical Surfaces, Images formed by Reflection, Refraction at plane and Spherical Surfaces, Images formed by Refraction, The Eye and eye-function, Optical Instruments, Chromatic Aberrations, Spherical Aberrations, The Rainbow, Caustics. Considering when it was written, the form is rather old-fashioned: a concise march of Definitions, Propositions, Corollaries, and Discussions in Scholia. The material is elementary, detailed, and based on physical principles expressed in geometry, trigonometry and ratios; with very few equations. The physical and geometric optics material relies heavily on Newton, the <i>Opticks<i> and <i>Optical Lectures<i> being cited frequently.||Importantly, Wood does not make extensive use of analysis; something which by this time the French had developed to high level in optics. Wood's work was at the cusp of the transition that brought continental analysis to Cambridge in particular and British university education in general.","William Whewell and Cambridge Mathematics|Becher, H.W.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 1, 1980, pp. 1-48.",****,"The Elements of Optics designed for the use of students in the University.

The translation was produced just a few months after Herschel's papers appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Though Harding was an observational astronomer, his interests were wide, and his translation is an early indication of the impetus Herschel's work provided for interest in and research into thermal radiation.
","William Herschel records that he was investigating the heating power of the visible prismatic spectrum produced by the sun using several thermometers, bulbs blacked with Japan ink, placed at a few positions in the visible spectrum. As a type of control, he had placed an additional thermometer beyond the red of the projected spectrum. The invisible radiation there produced the greatest temperature rise. As a check of his results, he conducted an investigation into the illuminating power of various parts of the spectrum, finding that pale green provided 'the maximum illumination' and that part beyond the read was invisible. He followed his initial discovery with a series of experiments he hoped would determine 'whether light be essentially different from radiant heat.' Herschel recorded the results from this series of experiments showing that the invisible heat radiation he had discovered beyond the red end of the prismatic solar spectrum suffer refraction, can be focused, can be reflected, and can be dispersed like visible radiation.||Herschel records his investigation into the similarities and differences between visible and invisible heat radiation. He uses both the sun and 'terrestrial' sources of heat radiation, such as a candle flame and a kitchen fire. Though he initially consider them both to be different manifestations of the same radiant phenomenon, he eventually concluded that heat and light 'have nothing in common but a certain equal degree of refrangibility.' Not withstanding this conclusion, Herschel provided in this series of papers  the enormous first impetus to the study of thermal radiation.","‚ÅÇ Herschel's Dilemma in the Interpretation of Thermal Radiation|Lovell, D.J.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 59, No 1, 1968, pp 46-60.||<i>The Lamp of Learning: Taylor & Francis and the Development of Science Publishing<i>|Brock, W.H., Meadows A.J.|London: Taylor and Francis, 1998, pp. 89‚Äì109.||<i>A History of Scientific & Technical Periodicals: The Origins and Development of the Scientific and Technical press, 1665‚Äì1790<i>|Kronick, D.|Metuchen: Scarecrow Press, 1976.",****,"Des Herrn Dr. Herschels Untersuchungen uÃàber die Natur der Sonnenstrahlen.

"Young, Thomas",Thomas Young,," ",1773-1829,,," ",The Bakerian Lecture  On the theory of light and colours.,"The second Bakerian lecture presented by Thomas Young, proposing a wave theory of light, based on an oscillating luminiferous aether and the wave-front propagation principle described by Huygens more than century earlier. 
","Thomas Young was given the Bakerian Medal and Prize Lecture of the Royal Society of London three times: 1800, 1801, and 1803. This is the second lecture and with it Young presents a wave theory of light, based on an oscillating luminiferous aether and the wave-front propagation principle described by Huygens more than century earlier. The paper presents a theory, consisting of hypotheses and propositions. It systematically evaluates Isaac Newton's wave-theory objections and refutes them. The papers was read before the Royal Society in November of 1801 and appeared half a year later in the first part of the Transactions published in 1802. There was little if any reaction to the lecture and its printing, and no support for the theory. Predictably, the Edinburgh Review was scornful, writing that the treatment was 'paltry and unsubstantial,' and urged the Royal Society not to lower its standards by admission of Young's papers. Though Young would subsequently present evidence of the theory's correctness, the to-and-fro between the particle and wave theories of light would continue for another 20 years. A 'free translation' into German of both the second and third lectures appeared in the <i>Annalen der Physik<i> in 1811.
","Thomas Young lays out a wave theory of light in four hypotheses, nine propositions, and five corollaries. The hypotheses are as follows. 1: An all-pervading aether; 2: Luminous object excite undulations in the aether; 3: Color sensation depends on the frequency of the vibrations; 4: Aether is absorbed in various densities in various bodies and a layer of aether surrounds bodies due to their attraction. The propositions are as follows. 1: All impulses propagate with the same velocity; 2: Single luminous points produce spherical undulations; 3: Undulations through an aperture propagate rectilinearly; 4: Undulations partially reflect at interfaces of media with different densities; 5: Undulations propagate across the interface of different media in directions given by Snell's law; 6: Undulations can suffer total internal reflection; 7: Undulation velocity is affected by particle vibrations within the medium; 8: Undulation motions combine; 9: Radiant light is undulations in the aether. The corollaries rely in an essential way on the hypothesis that the aether accumulates in and surrounds bodies; using the theory they explain the following: Colors of striated surfaces, colors of thin plates, colors of thick plates, blackness, inflected colors. In this sense, the lecture is as much about the distribution of the aether as it is about waves propagating through it. Using his theory, the data Newton provided for thin-plate colors, and a presumed velocity propagation, Young calculated and reported the wavelength and frequency associated with prismatic colors. They are remarkably accurate.","Men and Milestones in Optics II: Thomas Young|Barr, E.S.|<i>Applied Optics<i>, Vol 2, No 6, 1963, pp 639-647.||Was Thomas Young a wave theorist?|Cantor, G.N.|<i>American Journal of Physics<i>, Vol 52, No 4, 1984, pp 305-308.",****,"""The Bakerian Lecture: On the theory of light and colours.""

","The University of Coimbra was founded as a <i>Studium Generale<i> in Lisbon in 1290 but by 1537 was permanently located at Coimbra. In 1772, the Marquis of Pombal, prime minister of King Jos√© I, undertook a major reform of the university, where the study of the sciences assumed vast importance. The text was printed by the university and so its commissioning was undoubtedly part of that very large project.

"Euler, Leonhard",Leonhard Euler,," ",1707-1783,"Jean-Baptiste Labey (1750-1825) French mathematician, professor at l'√âcole militaire de Paris.",t,"Translated by Jean-Baptiste Labey (1750-1825) French mathematician, professor at l'√âcole militaire de Paris.",Lettres aÃÄ une princesse d'Allemagne,"An edited collection of the 234 letters Euler wrote at the request of Frederick II of Prussia as a form of tutoring Frederick's niece, princess Sophie. The cover nearly all of natural philosophy, philosophy, logic, and important physical questions of Euler's time.
","At the invitation of Frederick II of Prussia, Euler joined the Berlin Academy In 1741 and stayed until 1766. Frederick asked Euler to be a scientific tutor to his niece, Princess Sophie, who lived in Magdeburg. Euler obliged, writing between April 1760 and May 1762, 234 letters in French to the Princess. Beginning in 1762, there was tension between Frederick and Euler, and likely explains whey the letters were not published until Euler was in Saint Petersburg beginning in June 1766. The Lettres were published in Russia in French, their language of composition and the second language of most of Europe. Their popular style, scope, and clarity of presentation allowed them to reach a large readership. The first two volumes of the Lettres appeared in 1768 and the last in 1772. While in Russia, Euler prepared the first German translation, while between 1768 and 1774 Euler‚Äôs student Stepan Rumovskij translated the Letters from French into Russian, the first of five Russian editions leading up to 1808. By 1800 they had gone through thirty editions and were translated into seven other languages: Danish, Dutch, English, German, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish.|| The Lettres present Euler's mature positions on matters of natural philosophy, benefitting from earlier research and speculations. He begins simply but moves quickly to more difficult topics. Euler assumed his reader had little knowledge of natural philosophy or mathematics and so the Letters contain no mathematics. Important are Euler's examples; the text showing his insight, how he worked through problems, and the clarity of his explanations.
","The initial three topics of the Lettres‚Äîextension, velocity, and sound‚Äîwere among the 79 dealing with general physical science and comprise the first of three natural divisions of the Lettees. The first division contains Letter 1-79.  Letters 4 to 17 proceeded to music, the air, and the atmosphere. Lettres 17 to 45 explained light, first considering the systems of Descartes and Newton on the subject. Euler rejected both and proceeded to his pulse theory, then to optics generally, the theory of colors, dioptrics, reflection, vision, and the structure of the eye. His opposition to Newton‚Äôs corpuscular optics did not mean that Euler was anti-Newtonian, rather he found fault with Newton's optics on questions of reflection and refraction.  Euler treated light as analogous to sound, as a vibration in the aether. Since the time of Galileo Galilei Light's speed had not been thought to be instantaneous. Euler calculated a value of light speed very close to the modern accepted value. The aether appears in Lettre 19 and Euler used it to explain most physical phenomena, including mechanical, optical, magnetic, and electrical. Lettres 45 to 79 addressed gravity and its effects, along with mechanics, cosmology, the tides, and the theory of matter.||The second division contains Lettres 80-133 and presents inquires into philosophy, religion, and logic. The third division contains Lettres 134 to 234 and is devoted entirely to physical questions. Electricity in 138-154, navigation and the longitude problem 155-169, and magnetism in 169-187.","<i>Leonhard Euler: Mathematical Genius in the Enlightenment<i>|Calinger, R.S.|Princeton University Press, 2016, 696 pp, NB: pp 461-469.||Leonhard Euler's Wave Theory of Light|Pdeersen, K.M.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 16, No 4, 2008, pp 392-416.",****,"Lettres aÃÄ une princesse d'Allemagne, sur divers sujets de physique et de philosophie Par L.

","Christian Heinrich Pfaff wrote a paper that appeared in 1812 in the Journal f√ºr Chemie und Physik. In it he reported color experiments with birefringent crystals and showed how the results disproved Wolfgang van Goethe‚Äôs color theory both generally and particularly. Pfaff's <i>Newton's Farbentheorie<i> of 1813 was a direct development of that paper, written to report Pfaff's additional experiments and give a general refutation of Goethe's theory of colors. Pfaff's book is remarkable in that he was a respected and well-known members of scientific circles (famed for his work in chemistry and electricity) and a confirmed Newtonian, but was seriously and sufficiently interested in Goethe's theory to study it carefully and derive experiments to test its validity. By the time Pfaff's book appeared, Goethe's <i>Zur Farbenlehre<i> of 1810 had been reviewed in the scientific literature and roundly dismissed. But Pfaff was the first to study the theory and test it with experiments and to trouble himself to write an extended analysis, rather than simply pronounce Goethe's theory contrary to received wisdom.
","Pfaff reports a series of experiments, both simple and complex, that give results incompatible with Goethe's theory of color. Each of books chapters describes these. 2: Goethe's ur-phenomenon is doubtful. 3: Refutation of Goethe's theory of secondary images. 4: Refutation of Goethe's description of the colored sun image. 5: Proof that colored rays already exist in the prism. 6: Lens phenomena refute Goethe's theory. 7: Newton's theory of heterogeneous white light defended against the objections of the new doctrine. 8: Different refrangibility of different colored rays proved by new experiments and Goethe's objects refuted. 9: The influence of margins on color formation. 10: The Occult qualities of Goethe's theory. 11: Remarks about Newton's presentation of his theory. In addition there are 4 appendices on technical details. The material is very detailed, especially the technical details of the experiments. The interpretation of the results is straightforward and Pfaff explains how they refute Goethe's ideas, particularly the special pleading that often characterized arguments in support of Goethe's theory.","Another Kind of Light: The Work of T.J.

"Brewster, David",David Brewster,," ",1781-1868,,," ",On the laws which regulate the polarization of light by reflexion from transparent bodies,"David Brewster's famed paper on polarization, the index of refraction, and the angles of incidence and refraction. The first explication of ""Brewster's Angle.""","David Brewster's famed paper that presents the relationship between partial and complete polarization, the index of refraction of the reflecting medium, and the angles of incidence and refraction. An unwearying experimenter in optics, Brewster took immediate notice of the 1812 announcement of Malus that light could be polarized by reflection and conducted an extensive series of experiments. The result allowed him to formulate the geometric and optical conditions of polarization, the most famous is the eponymous Brewster's Angle.
","David Brewster used his considerable skill with instruments to conduct a large number of experiments involving transparent materials of various refractive indices, the geometry of incidence and refraction, and the measurement of polarization by reflectance. His experiments involved: polarization by front surface reflection from transparent materials, second surface reflection, polarization by reflection at media interfaces, polarization by successive reflections, practical polarization of heterogeneous light by reflection. From his experimental results Brewster adduced 29 propositions. The central result was expressed by what is now called Brewster's Angle; the relationship between the index of refraction of the reflecting material and the incidence angle at which reflected light is maximally linearly polarized. He also made clear the fact that heterogeneous light could not be completely polarized by reflection at any one angle since the index of refraction varied for its constituents. Though Brewster claims to make no hypothetical assumptions, several of his propositions involve Newton's idea of attractive force as the cause of refraction.","Brewster on the Nature of Light|Cantor, G.N.|In:  <i>Martyr of Science, Sir David Brewster 1701-1868 <i>|Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh, 1984, pp 67-76.",****,"""On the laws which regulate the polarization of light by reflexion from transparent bodies"" In: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

"Fraunhofer, Joseph",Joseph Fraunhofer,," ",1787-1826,,," ",Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten,"Fraunhofer describes his discovery of the narrow dark lines in the solar spectrum--the Fraunhofer lines--and the process and instruments he used them to accurately determine glass's dispersion. Fraunhofer's paper was internationally influential, and changed optical measurement practice throughout the technical world.
","Joseph Fraunhofer wrote the <i>Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten<i> in 1814-1815. He had been directing all aspects of glass production of the Bavarian Optical Institute at BenediktBeuren, the secularized Benedictine monastery in Bavaria. It was producing the largest flawless blanks of the finest high refractive index flint glass in the world. As had been clear to Boscovich, Clairaut, and D'Alembert before him, Fraunhofer knew that what was required to produce fine achromatic lenses was not only flawless glass but an accurate knowledge of its dispersion; that is, its index of refraction for light throughout the spectrum. With the discovery of the narrow dark lines in the solar spectrum--the eponymous Fraunhofer lines--he was able to accurately measure their refractive shift in a glass sample, and from that accurately determine the glass's dispersion. Fraunhofer's process and instruments allowed him to determine refractive indices with a precision of one part in 1,000,000. No previous method could do better than one part in 1,000. This high-precision data about glass allowed the Optical Institute to produce the largest and finest achromatic lenses in the world. Fraunhofer's paper was internationally influential, and changed optical measurement practice throughout the technical world. Its influence was broader than instrumentational; it make clear the role and benefit of technology guided by craft and artisanal skill of the highest order.||Fraunhofer's article first appeared in Denkschriften der k√∂niglichen Academie der Wissenschaften zu M√ºnchen f√ºr die Jahre 1814 und 1815, Vol 5, which was published in 1817. It was much more widely known after its appearance in the Annalen der Physik, New Series, Vol 26, of 1817. English and French translations appeared in 1823.
","Fraunhofer begins his article with a clear statement of the then-urgent need for a way to accurately determine refractive index of glass through the visible spectrum. His initial experiment was an ingenious variant of the method used by Clairaut 50 years earlier: establish the narrowest possible samples of the spectrum--what would now be called monochromatic light--and used them to determine the index of fraction of a glass sample. Rather than use color filters, Fraunhofer use six alcohol burning lamps, each illuminating a prism through narrow slits at a range of incidence angle . The incidence angles were such that a different portion of the prismatic spectrum of each lamp was sent in the same general direction toward a distant prism of the glass being measured, behind which was positioned a modified theodolite to accurately measure the angle produced by refraction in the sample. From this angle the index of refraction could be calculated. But however narrow the slit there was always sufficient spread and overlap to diminish the final precision. Then Fraunhofer used the sun as a single light source and discovered a continuous spectrum with narrow dark lines. Experiment showed the lines to be inherent and in fixed in positions in the solar spectrum and so could be used as precise spectral markers. Rather than use a narrow sample of the spectrum, Fraunhofer used its fixed, much more narrow dark lacunae. Indices of refraction could be determined to one part in 1,000,000. The article contains tables of values of indices for several optical materials.","‚ÅÇ  <i>Spectrum of Belief: Joseph Von Fraunhofer and the Craft of Precision Optics <i>|Jackson, M.W.|MIT Press, 2000, pp 59-74.||From Theodolite to Spectral Apparatus|Jackson, M.W.|In:  <i>Instrumentation: Between Science, State, and Industry <i>, Joerges, B., Shinn, T., editors|Kluwer, 2001, 270 pp, NB: pp 17-29.||Buying the Dark Lines of the Solar Spectrum|Jackson, M.W.|In:  <i>Archimedes, Scientific Credibility and Technical Standards <i>, Buchwald, J.Z., editor|Kluwer, 1997, 178 pp, NB: pp 1-23.",****,"""Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten, in Bezug auf die Vervollkommnung achromatischer Fernr√∂hre""  In: Annalen der Physik, New Series, Vol 26, pp 264-313.","""Determination of the refractions and color-dispersion properties of various types of glass, with respect to the improvement of acrhomatic telescopes.""",1817,1800-1825,"German optician, glass and lens maker of revoluationary skill.","BioSketch: 1787-1826  German optician, glass and lens maker of revoluationary skill.",1,1817,First edition,House of Johann Abrosius Barth,Leipzig,,Printed at Leipzig for House of Johann Abrosius Barth,51.3419,12.3751,,,,,later 3/4 gray calf over marbled boards,Later 3/4 Gray Calf Over Marbled Boards,Crown 8·¥º,8,"8¬∞ ",110,190,Format and Size:  4¬∞  190 x 110 mm,Crown 8·¥º 190x110 mm,190 x 110 mm,œÄ¬≤ ‚ãÜ‚ãÜ‚Å¥ A-Z‚Å¥ Aa-Ee‚Å¥,"[ùüôùüö] [(1)] (2)-(440) ",Plates [I-V],,Stamp of the British Museum of Natural History and 'Withdrawn' stamp,British Museum of Natural History,s,Collation: œÄ¬≤ ‚ãÜ‚ãÜ‚Å¥ A-Z‚Å¥ Aa-Ee‚Å¥|Pagination: [ùüôùüö] [(1)] (2)-(440)|Plates: [I-V],https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bibliothecaopticoriaimages/1817 Fraunhofer - Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten - Images.JPG,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1817 Fraunhofer - Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten - Images.JPG,Title Page,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1817 Fraunhofer - Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten - Images 2.JPG,,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1817 Fraunhofer - Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten - Images 3.JPG,,https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bibliothecaopticoriaimages/1816 Fresnel - Memoire sur la diffraction de la lumiere - Images.JPG|https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bibliothecaopticoriadescriptions/1816 Fresnel - Memoire sur la diffraction de la lumiere|http://www.e-rara.ch/zut/content/titleinfo/13227204,http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15065z/f276.item,625,,,,11/11/2014,US 2925,"$2,925",Purchased From Herman H.J.

Fresnel had adopted a wave theory based on Huygens‚Äôs Principle which he used to predict diffraction fringe placement and size. The agreement between Fresnel‚Äôs measurements and predictions were spectacular and his memoire was awarded the prize; the Memoire Couronn√©.
","Augustin-Jean Fresnel's memoire submitted for the prize announced by the French Academy in 1817 for a memoire explaining diffraction. The original language of the prize announcement appeared to limit submissions to those based on rays or corpuscular theories of light, but Francois Arago wrangled a change that allowed Fresnel's work to be considered. Since the publication of his first memoir on diffraction in 1816, Fresnel's work has advanced in three significant ways: he had embraced Huygens‚Äôs Principle for modelling light propagation, thus abandoning rays and their interaction, he had increased the precision with which he measured the positions of diffraction fringe maxima, and he constructed a computational framework based on Huygens‚Äôs Principle of sufficient complexity to predict fringe maxima. From this latter development came the eponymous Fresnel Integrals. The agreement between Fresnel‚Äôs measurements and predictions were spectacular and his memoire was awarded the prize; the Memoire Couronn√©. Fresnel's work was a conceptual and analytic triumph; the wave-based theory of light could no longer be set aside. This printing of the Memoire Couronn√© did not include the introduction in which Fresnel delineated why a ray or corpuscular theory of light could not be correct. Fresnel's long work is printed in two parts in Volume 11 of the Annales de Chimie et de Physique; pp 246-295 and 337-376. The memoire was printed in full by the French Academy in 1826 and in the Oeuvres of 1866. J.C. Poggendorff's German translation appeared in the Annalen der Physik und Chemie in 1836 and an English translation in 1900.
","Fresnel began the memoire delineating reasons why a ray or corpuscular theory of light cannot be correct, the essential problem being that rays and corpuscles are independent and only mechanical interactions can be used to explain optical phenomena. The rest of the memoire is essentially a series of lectures, giving background and detail appropriate for readers not familiar with wave analysis. The topics, in turn, are: all 'rays' are involved in diffraction, not just those near the diffractor; Huygens's Principle permits the necessary interactions to be modelled; a diffractor blocks part of an otherwise full wavefront and the resulting sub-wavefronts generate interference fringes; positions of fringe maxima can be predicted only by incorporating (integrating) the phase interactions along the wavefront that is not blocked by the diffractor; derivation of the integrals that express the necessary phase interactions; comparison of predictions of position of fringe maxima with experimental measurement. Fresnel's analyses included fringes produced by a half-infinite diffractor, a narrow slit, and a narrow diffractor. In most cases the agreement with position measurements was withing 1.5%.","‚ÅÇ  <i>The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light <i>|Buchwald, J.Z|University of Chicago Press, 1989, 474 pp, NB: pp 168-183.||Memoir on the Diffraction of Light 'Crowned' by the French Academy of Sciences in 1819 by A.

"Fraunhofer, Joseph",Joseph Fraunhofer,," ",1787-1826,,," ",Neue Modifikation des Lichtes,Fraunhofer presents the first quantitative discussion of the diffraction of light.¬†,"Fraunhofer had described his discovery of the narrow dark lines in the solar spectrum--the Fraunhofer lines--in his paper of 1817. By 1821 Fresnel‚Äôs work on the wave theory of light and interference had become widely known and and so Fraunhofer published two papers in which he observed and analyzed certain diffraction phenomena and interpreted them in terms of a wave theory of light. In the 1821 paper, contained in this volume of the Denkschriften, he discussed his examination of the spectra resulting from light diffracted through a single narrow slit and quantitatively related the width of the slit to the angles of dispersion of the different orders of spectra. An offprint of the paper appeared in 1821, the year Fraunhofer presented the paper. The Denkschriften was printed only every three years, so Fraunhofer's diffraction work did not appear in the journal until 1824.","In this paper Fraunhofer discussed his examination of the spectra resulting from light diffracted through a single narrow slit and quantitatively related the width of the slit to the angles of dispersion of the different orders of spectra. The papers begins with the claim that the advance of science depends on precision instruments, particularly in optics. He then described the phenomenon of diffraction and how it can produced by light passing through a small opening into a darkened room and the light viewed in on a distant screen. The illuminated part of the screen was larger than the opening and exhibited colored fringes at the edges. New experiments are then described, designed for measurements using a heliostat and a narrow slit that diffracted the light.  The results on the screen was examined by a theodolite, which could measure the angles involved, showing that the angle of diffraction is inversely proportional to the width of the opening. Similarly, using gratings of parallel silver or gold wires, he found that the diffraction is inversely proportional to the separation of the wires. Fraunhofer's grating had 260 wires, separated by about 0.004 Paris inch with wire thickness of about 0.002 inch. Fraunhofer made the first quantitative study of diffraction phenomena. The presence of the solar dark lines enabled him to note that the dispersion of the spectra was greater with his grating than with his prism. Hence, he examined the relationship between dispersion and the separation of wires in the grating. From the same study Fraunhofer was able to determine the wavelengths of specific colors of light.","From Theodolite to Spectral Apparatus|Jackson, M.W.|In:  <i>Instrumentation: Between Science, State, and Industry <i>, Joerges, B., Shinn, T., editors|Kluwer, 2001, 270 pp, NB: pp 17-29.||Buying the Dark Lines of the Solar Spectrum|Jackson, M.W.|In:  <i>Archimedes, Scientific Credibility and Technical Standards <i>, Buchwald, J.Z., editor|Kluwer, 1997, 178 pp, NB: pp 1-23.||Lines of Light|Brand, J.C.D.|Gordon and Breach, 1995, 266 pp, NB: pp 37-47.",****,"Neue Modifikation des Lichtes durch gegenseitige Einwirkung und Beugung der Strahlen, und Gesetze derselben.

Of the German textbooks generally available at the time, only Andreas Baumgartner's <i>Die Naturlehre<i> of 1824 contained a presentation of Fresnel's research and a summary his wave theory of light.
","Fresnel's essay contains sections on the nature of light, diffraction, thin-film interference, reflection and refraction, double refraction and polarization, chromatic polarization, and modification of polarization by reflection.  He developed in detail the wave theory of light he had described in summaries and extracts in the short memoires he had published in the Annals de Chemie et de Physique between 1816 and 1822.  Fresnel showed how his wave theory successfully explained and predicted all then-known optical phenomena except chromatic dispersion. In was in this essay that the full explanation of transverse waves was presented and a full description of polarized light was given. With it, Fresnel's complete wave theory of light was described in sufficient detail for other to follow, consider, and work on and marked the beginning of the wave theory of light's general acceptance in science."," <i>History of the Principle of Interference of Light <i>|Kipnis, N.|Springer, Basel, 1991, 271 pp, NB pp 224-231.",****,"""√úber das Licht"" In: Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 1st Series,  Vol 3, pp 393-329",On Light,1825,1825-1850,"French engineer, physicist, experimentalist.

","Eduard Moritz Hahn's translation of Amondiue's <i>Essai d'un Cours √âÃÅleÃÅmentaire d'Optique<i> of 1826. Hahn justifies his German translation of Amondieu's French work because of its concision, completeness, and even-handedness of treatment of the emission and wave theories of light without elaborate mathematics. He complains that many otherwise admirable German work on optics confuse verbosity with thoroughness. Through Hahn's translation, this is the first appearance of Fresnel's transverse wave theory of light in a German textbook--albeit without its elaborate mathematical underpinning. Interestingly, and perhaps confusingly, Hahn refers to the wave theory as Euler's--a reflection of the general labels 'Eulerian' and 'Newtonian' used to describe the wave and emission theories of light as they were discussed and debated in the second half of the 18th century. Johann Lambert used the same labels in his <i>Photometria<i> of 1760 to distinguish between the two theories.
","Amondieu's book is in four parts: Presentation of most known optical phenomena; The wave theory of light and its explanation of these phenomena; The particle or emission theory of light and its explanation of these phenomena; Application of optics to meteorics and instruments. The first part describes: direct light, catoptrics, dioptrics, lenses, the eye and eye-function, chromatic dispersion, double refraction, polarization, diffraction, the thermal and chemical effects of the solar spectrum. The second and third parts present, respectively, the wave and emission theories explanations of reflection, refraction, dispersion, double refraction, polarization, and the thermal and chemical effects of the solar spectrum. The wave theory is that of Fresnel and the emission theory is Newtonian. The forth part briefly describes luminous atmospheric phenomena and optical instruments, particularly the application of achromatic lenses. Hahn adds some notes to this last section on instruments--considering it too brief given the importance of instruments.","Joseph Louis Adrien Amondieu (1795-1849) Professeur de physique|In: Le Lyc√©e Clemenceau: 200 Ans d'Histoire, 2008.",****,"Amondieu's Versuch eines elementarischen Lehrbegriffs der Optik.

"Prechtl, Johann Joseph von",Johann Joseph von Prechtl,," ",1778-1854,,," ",Traite Dioptrique,"A close French translation of Prechtl's practical manual for making dioptric instruments
","A French translation of Johann Joseph von Prechtl's practical manual on all aspects of making a telescope with achromatic and aplanatic objectives. A high craftsman himself, Prechtl was keen about the telescope and considered that 'the invention of the telescope and the achromatic in particular, is one of the greatest ornaments of human ingenuity.' Though Prechtl considers only algebra and geometry required to understand the practice of lens design, they are necessary if lens making is not be 'reduced to mere glass-cutting.' Prechtl presents Herschel's equations for lens design involving aperture, focal length, aberrations, and glass characteristics. Prechtl covers every step of the telescope-making process including all the materials, equipment, and instruments required. Prechtl was inspired by Joseph Fraunhofer and presents his legendary lenses as models and ideals, hoping in influence Viennese opticians. Prechtl believed that if a craftsman had good material and good practice, he could produce excellent lenses. Prechtl's book was widely used by opticians and astronomical observatory staff throughout the world; it was still being cited 50 years after its publication in the technical optical literature. It seems likely that this translations was prepared for publication. A very close French translation, it reads as a fair copy in French of Prechtl's work of 1828. The manuscript is not dated and no printed French version of Prechtl's text is known.","Prechtl's book is in five sections. 1: General consideration of refractive optics, single and multiple lenses, image formation. 2: Spherical and chromatic aberrations, how lens materials and figure are used to suppress aberrations. 3: Glass properties, index of refraction and chromatic dispersion, instruments for determining index of refraction and dispersion. 4: Characteristics of telescopes, relationships between aperture, brightness, magnification, field of view, multiple lens eyepieces. 5: Glass grinding by hand and machine, lens figuring and polishing, mounting and centering lenses, glass types and their manufacture. The book presents little theoretical development, only the result of Herschel's work in the form of algebraic lens design equations taken from his treatise on light. The material is practical in the extreme: all applications of the various lens equations are demonstrated in detailed examples, tables of data for glass are provided, parameters for a range of lenses and telescopes, and as a commercial example of what is practical, a list of apertures, focal lengths, and magnifications of ocular lenses available from Fraunhofer's Optical Institute.","Buying the Dark Lines of the Solar Spectrum: Joseph Von Fraunhofer‚Äôs Standard for the Manufacture of Optical Glass|Jackson, M.W.|In: Scientific Credibility and Technical Standards in 19th and early 20th century Germany and Britain|Buchwald, J.Z., editor, Springer, 1997, pp 1-22.||Fraunhofer's work and its present-day significance|von Rohr, M.|<i>Transactions of the Optical Society <i>, Vol 28, No 5, 1925, pp 277-294.",****,Traite D'Optrique (MS),,1828,1825-1850,"German-born Austrian teacher, technologist, engineer.

But the article itself was privately distributed beginning in 1828 and had circulated widely before its appearance in the <i>Encyclop√¶dia<i>. It was immediately recognized both in England and on the continent as a magisterial summary of physical optics; that is, the nature and properties of light. Though Herschel considered his work an 'essay', it was 243 quarto pages with additional plates and an index, and was treated as a monograph in its subsequent and immediate reprintings and translations. Pierre Frabcius Verhulst produced this French translation aided by Adolphe Quetelet. The translation was undertaken because the complete encyclopedia was expensive and of very uneven quality, and so access to important parts of it was difficult. Quetelet and Verhulst considered the extraction and translation of Herschel's essay a necessity for French science because it was 'the most complete treatise on this important part of physics.' The translation corrected the many typographical errors in the first English printing (for which it was notorious), duplicated nearly all of the mathematics, benefited from corrections provided by Herschel himself, and ended with a long supplement by Quetelet containing notes, commentary, and reprint of articles related to then-recent developments in optics. Though the translation of the full article was completed, and the first volume published in 1829, problems with the published delayed the second volume‚Äôs appearance for nearly four years. It was this interval that prompted Quetelet to write  his supplement.
","Herschel's essay is in four parts: Unpolarized Light, Chromatics, Theories of Light, Polarized Light. 1: Unpolarized Light including photometry, reflection from plane and curved surfaces, refraction at plane and curved surfaces, aberrations, images from lenses, the eye and vision. 2: Chromatics including dispersion, achromatic lenses, extinction from propagation in transparent media. 3: Theories of Light including Newtonian or corpuscular theory, general undulatory theory, interference, colors from thin and thick plates, diffraction. 4: Polarized Light including double refraction, interaction of polarized light, reflection of polarized light, refraction of polarized light, application of the undulatory theory, light in crystals, light's interaction with materials, properties of glass, colors of bodies, calorific and chemical rays in the solar spectrum. Herschel's treatments of the undulatory theory of light is a full statement of Fresnel's theory and the best presentation of the wave theory for 10 years after it appeared.","‚ÅÇ <i>The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light<i>|Buchwald, J.Z|University of Chicago Press, 1989, 474 pp, NB: pp 291-296.||The Reception of the Wave Theory of Light in Britain: A Case Study Illustrating the Role

It is an example of the ongoing dichotomy of romanticism's artistic color experiences and the theory built from them, and the chromatic physical optics originating with Newton.","Walter Crum produced this brief treatise color coming from a background of textile dying and pigments in 1822. Though Goethe is never mentioned, Crum presents the Aristotelian/Goethean idea that color is the result of the mixing of light and dark. Experiments are presented and their results are interpreted to support the basic idea and to attempt to soften, if not disprove, the Newtonian interpretation of prismatic colors. Crum both examined light dispersed by prism and how colors arose when view through a prism. Crum's treatise is an example of the ongoing dichotomy of romanticism's artistic color experiences and the theory built from them, and the chromatic physical optics originating with Newton. It also makes clear the difference between the industrial and commercial need to understand color and the philosopher's theories.  Crum's work is a condensation of part of the longer work by Joseph Reade, <i>Experimental Outlines for a New Theory of Colours, Light & Vision<i>, of 1816. After 1822, Crum was made aware of Reade's work, and finding the two works so similar decided not to publish. But the scant attention Reade's work attracted eventually prompted Crum to publish his own work. Crum was a significant figure in the textile dying and printing industry and his work and ideas were widely influential.
","Crum presents experiments most of which are exercises in color perception on complex fields. The results are marshaled to support his principle ideas. 1: There are three primary colors, red, blue, and yellow. 2: Color is the result of the mixing of light and dark, with colors being 'drawn out' of dark by the presence of light. 3: The prismatic colors are not immutable, as Newton claimed.","<i>Science Versus Practice: Chemistry in Victorian Britain<i>|Bud, R., Roberts, G.K.|Manchester University Press, 1984, 243 pp, NB pp 36-37, 121.||The Influence of Demand on the Emergence of the Dye Industry.

He reworked much of the material in the optics article he wrote for the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, as well as his supplement to Ferguson.
","David Brewster wrote this elementary text as part of Dionysius Lardner's series <i>The Cabinet Cyclopedia<i>. Brewster had produced the long article on optics for the <i>Edinburgh Encyclopaedia<i> the previous year  and updated and augmented three editions of Ferguson's <i>Lectures on Select Subjects<i> between 1803 and 1823, so he had a practiced idea of what should be in a general exposition of optics for the lay reader. He reworked much of the material in the 1823 edition of his supplement to Ferguson. The composition is, as might be expected from Bewster's interest and commitment to the emission theory of light, heavily weighted to physical optics and the emission theory of light. It is also freighted with detailed descriptions of many of Brewster's experiments, about which Baden Powell would later comment on Brewster's text: '... and in regard to the more recondite experimental results, the student would feel rather overwhelmed with the multitude of details, than enlightened by a view of general truths.'  Editions appeared at London in 1831 and 1853, at Philadelphia in 1833 and 1841, and a German translation at Leipzig in 1836.
","Brewster's treatise is in four parts: Reflection and refraction of light; Physical optics; Natural optical phenomena; Optical instruments. 1: Reflection and refraction of light includes plain and spherical mirrors, images from mirrors, refraction in general, lenses, rays convex and concave lenses, meniscus lenses, images from lenses, magnification, spherical aberrations.  2: Physical optics includes chromatic heterogeneity, dispersion, achromatic lenses, solar spectrum, diffraction, colors from thin and thick plates, double refraction, polarized light and polarization effects of different materials. 3: Natural optical phenomena includes the rainbow, halos and coronae, parahelia, object colors, the eye and eye-function, colored shadows. 4: Optical instruments includes mirrored instruments, single and compound lenses, prisms and magnifiers, magic lantern and camera lucida, microscopes, telescopes, achromatic telescopes. The material is weighted heavily to physical optics: 60 pages are devoted to geometric optics, 200 pages to physical optics, 40 pages to natural phenomena, and 50 pages to optical instruments. Much of the physical optics section is filled with reports of the many investigations Brewster made on light interacting with crystals and other materials. The imbalance in level of detail, compared to that in the geometrical optics section is striking; chromatic aberration, for example, is barely touched upon. The whole of the material is descriptive, with only elementary geometry used. The physical optics material is entirely Newtonian, adhering to the emission theory of light; explaining, for example, interference by appeal to fits of easy reflection and transmission.","Scientific Revolutions and Scientific Rationality: The Case of the ""Elderly Holdout""|Worroll, J.|In: <i>Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Vol XIV, Scientific Theories<i>|Savage, W., editor|University of Minnesota Press, 1990, 410 pp, pp 319-354.",****,"The Cabinet Cyclopaedia.

"Olmstead, Dension",Dension Olmstead,," ",1791-1859,,," ",Introduction to Natural Philosophy,A two-volume textbook on natural philosophy for use at universities. Widely used and in print for 50 years.,"Denison Olmsted wrote this two-volume textbook on natural philosophy early in his long teaching career at Yale College. In his Preface he refers to himself not as author but as 'compiler.' His stated goal is to consult the the latest and most authoritative writers in important fields of natural philosophy in order  1) to assemble a textbook that would 'make the student thoroughly familiarly acquainted with the leading principles of natural philosophy.' and 2) to 'furnish the student with as much useful information as possible.' In Olmsted's text, 'principles' and 'useful' are in italics and are the bywords for the entire work. There are very few derivations, with principles simply stated and, when appropriate, expressed mathematically with geometric, algebra, or trigonometry. Most of the text is devoted to demonstrating the principles and applying them to explain phenomena, show how machines work, describe instruments, and explain craft and technique.||The work was tremendously successful, being widely used and preprinted, with editions appearing in 1831, 1835, 1840, 1842, 1844, 1852, 1855, 1859, and 1870. An extensively revised and expanded edition appeared in 1891 and 1895.
","Olmsted's text is in six parts. Part 1 Principles of Mechanics (185 pages), covering laws of motion, gravity, projectile motion, and simple machines. Part 2 Applied Mechanics (157 pages), covering component motion, center of gravity, machinery, friction, and strength of materials. Part 3 Hydrostatics and Pneumatics (86 pages) covering fluids, fluid motion, cohesion and capillary action, fluid waves, properties of gases, air and steam, sound acoustics, and music. Part 4 Electricity (88 pages), covering general principles, electrical apparatus, Leyden jar, 'electrical light', electric battery, electrical phenomena, lightening, animal electricity. Part 5 Magnetism (35 pages), covering magnetic attraction and repulsion, 'directive' properties, the compass, magnetic navigation. Part 6 Optics (136 pages), covering nature and propagation of light, reflection, mirrors and their images, refraction, lenses and their images, Newton's chromatic heterogeneity, colors from this films, the rainbow, colors of objects, diffraction, double refraction and polarization, vision, microscopes, magic lantern, and telescopes.||For physical optics, both the wave and particle theories are presented, but both lead to the notion of the light ray, and it is used in all subsequent material. The geometric optics is elementary but thorough, accompanied by many small but clear figures.||Olmsted relies very heavily on the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana articles of Herschel, 'Light' and of Barlow, 'Optics'. He also relies on Brewster's 'Treatise on Optics'. Other sources included Newton, Huygens, Biot, Priestley, Euclid, Wood, and Ha√ºy. Interestingly, Fresnel is never used or cited.","Denison Olmsted an early American astronomer|Treadwell, T.R.|<i>Popular Astronomy<i>, Vol. 54, 1946, pp 237-241.",****,"An Introduction to Natural Philosophy: Designed as a Text Book, for the use of the Students in Yale College.

"Macvicar, John Gibson",John Gibson Macvicar,," ",1800-1884,,," ",Inquires concerning the Medium of Light and the Form of its Molecules,"A digest of a larger work dealing with the nature, form, and properties of the particles that make up medium that carries light.","Macvicar considered the corpuscular theory of light to be untenable, and while the undulatory one he though viable, little was known of the undulatory medium. He states that since this is the case, and no work has been done on the nature of the medium, he undertook a extensive analysis that leads him to propose ""ethereal molecules"" with shapes, forms, symmetries, structures, and propagation that explain optical phenomena. Color is inherent in these molecules, in that their ""natural and achromatic symmetry can be developed by dispersion."" This strange book is an indication of the lingering wave-particle controversy on the nature of light in Great Britain, and the wide range in the nature of those who took part in the long debate. Macvicar was certainly on the distant periphery, a dabbler--however committed--having no mathematics but mountains of curiosity and belief. In this regard, the difference between Macvicar's work to describe light's medium and the near-contemporaneous work of Augustin-Louis Cauchy could not be greater. Macvicar was an occasional correspondent with Michael Faraday, trying (unsuccessfully) to get Faraday to read his various treatises.","The first part of the book is ""Analysis"" and presents Macvicar's take on basic optical phenomena and experiments that reveal properties of light. The second part of the book is ""Synthesis"" and presents deductions from data and experiments that, it is contended, reveal the properties of ""light's molecules."" The material is entire descriptive--there is no mathematics of any type. ","Modern Metaphysicians: Rev.

"Schwerd, Friedrich Magnus",Friedrich Magnus Schwerd,," ",1792-1871,,," ","Die Beugungserscheinungen ","Schwerd was the first to make elaborate calculations to determine the amplitude and distribution in Fraunhofer diffraction patterns for many single apertures of various shapes, and arrays of apertures. He made drawings from his observations of the patterns, some reproduced in hand-colored plates in the book.
","Friedrich Magnus Schwerd began work on this treatise in 1833 in the spare time from his teaching duties. Schwerd calculated and observed the angular and chromatic dispersion displayed by Fraunhofer diffraction; that is, the pattern produced by diffraction of a small aperture observed at a distance very large compared to the aperture size and the wavelength of the light involved. Fraunhofer's work with diffraction gratings allowed him to formulate relationships between wavelength, aperture size, and diffracted angle. Schwerd was the first to make elaborate calculations using these relationships to determine the amplitude and distribution in Fraunhofer diffraction patterns for many single apertures of various shapes, and arrays of apertures. Schwerd made drawings from his observations of the patterns, some reproduced in hand-colored plates in the book. He also made experimental observations using equipment of his own design and manufacture to verify his calculations. The agreement between Schwerd's calculations and observations was seen as another, independent verification of the wave theory of light. His work would later be copied by Am√©dee Guillemin in his Les Ph√©nomenes de la Physique of 1868 and the data in Schwerd's book became standard, being used in physics and optics texts until the third decade of the 20th century.
","Schwerd calculated the Fraunhofer diffraction patterns produced by apertures with various geometric openings, including squares, rectangles, slits, circles, and combinations of these. The calculations produced the relative amplitude and positions of the patterns' forms and fringes. The calculations, done by summation approximations to the integrals involved, were comprehensive and reported in detail. Most interesting and influential was Schwerd's solution for a circular opening, the results for which was long quoted in optics texts, which he reports having obtained by approximating the circular opening with 180 trapezoids. The accuracy of Schwerd's calculations and drawings have been demonstrated by modern photographic and computational analysis.","Die Beugungserscheinungen: a Tribute to F. M.

","Lloyd's states the purpose of his report: 'consider in some detail the present state of our knowledge with regard to the physical theory of light, and the successive advances which have, in late years, been made toward its establishment.' Lloyd's plan is to consider important optical phenomena and evaluate how far they are commensurate with the wave and emission theories. The phenomena considered are in two groups: 1) Propagation and interference, reflection and refraction, diffraction, thin and thick plate colors, and 2) polarization and transverse waves, reflection and refraction of polarized light, double refraction, crystal plate colors. The report considers each in turn, giving the principle experimental data and evaluating the development of the emission and wave theories to explain them. The development includes more-or-less recent history of the work performed on both theories, with extensive citation of the relevant references. For the modern emission theory Biot is cited extensively, for the wave theory Young, Fresnel, Arago, and Cauchy are. Unlike Herschel's article 'Light' that had appeared in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana in 1830, Lloyd's report contains virtually no mathematics. The development and state of the two theories is given in purely descriptive form, in many ways making the case for the wave theory more compelling, certainly more approachable. The report is, in its essence, a vast review of the literature on physical optics.","Waves, Philosophers and Historians|Buchwald, J.Z.|In: <i>Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association, 1992<i>.

"Melloni, Macedonio",Macedonio Melloni,,,1798-1854,,," ",M√©moire sur la Polarisation de la Chaleur Seconde Partie,"Second of two memoires investigating the polarization of heat radiant heat
","Second of two memoires investigating the polarization of heat radiant heat. Using the apparatus developed for his heat flow experiments, Melloni demonstrates and investigates the polarization of radiant heat. Heat passing through plates of tourmaline is the principle method. This, and his first memoire on polarization, showed that radiant polarization was in all respects the same as optical polarization. This work was central in the eventual unification of light and heat as a single radiant phenomena. These papers attracted wide international attention, being translated almost immediately in German and English. This second memoire was prompted, in part, by exchanges that had taken place in British scientific journals regarding work by J.D. Forbes of the University of Edinburgh that supported the existence of radiant heat polarization. 
","In this memoire, Melloni uses laminae of mica to produce and detect radiant heat polarized by refraction and conducts experiments to determine how it behaves upon reflection. Importantly, Melloni shows that maximum radiant heat polarization takes place at the angle of incidence predicted by Brewster in the luminous case, using the index of refraction for radiant heat for mica. Melloni also detects birefingent polarization of radiant heat. In all cases, Melloni shows that it is necessary to shield or remove the heat radiated by the warmed laminae, otherwise it is mixed with the transmitted polarized radiation and confounds measurements. In doing so, he demonstrates some of the problems with J.D. Forbes' experiments.","The Infrared Pioneers--II.

"Barfuss, Friedrich Wilhelm",Friedrich Wilhelm Barfuss,," ",1809-?,,," ","Optik, Catoptrik und Dioptrik","A compendium of practical instrumental optics to explain the nature, construction, and use of such instruments, particularly of the telescope and microscope.","Friedrich Wilhelm Barfuss produced this compendium of practical instrumental optics to explain the nature, construction, and use of such instruments, particularly of the telescope and microscope. Barfuss' approach is entirely practical; that is, based solely on the use of optics to clarify and extend vision. This, his preface explains, is the justification for the long initial section on sight, perspective, shadow, anamorphosis, and appearances. Reflection and refraction are introduced in their simplest form, and then exemplified by consideration of the operation of a large number of experimental arrangements and instruments. In an attempt to reach a large audience, Barfuss holds it to be a mistake to introduce mathematical abstractions early in optical study; being appropriate only after a more graphical or geometric understanding is achieved and then mathematics can be invoked to consider advanced ideas and detail. For the more advanced material, Barfuss cites then-recent works on optics and instruments. Intending to provide a complete guide to instruments, he includes material on all aspects of glass working and instrument construction. Editions appeared in 1839, posthumously in 1860, and much revised in 1889. Barfuss published his <i>Theorie der Spiegelmikroscope mit Sph√§rischen Glasspiegeln<i> in 1840 as an addendum to the present work. 
","Barfuss' compendium is in nine chapters. 1: Vision and sight, perception, projection, camera obscura. 2: Perspective, appearance, shadows. 3: Laws of reflection, mirrors, analysis of plane and curved mirrors, images from mirrors, description of mirrored instrument operation, mirror anamorphosis. 4: Laws of refraction, refraction and plane and curved surfaces, operation of prisms, prismatic colors, index of refraction and dispersion, measurement, description of refractive instrument operation. 5: Lenses, types of lenses, analysis of lenses, calculating focal lengths and image position and size, spherical aberration, chromatic aberration. 6: Simple lensed instruments, camera lucida, camera obscura, magic lantern, the eye and eye-function, spectacles for vision correction. 7: Lensed telescopes, general form, types, magnification, achromatic objectives, discussion of recent practical lens work, example telescopes, telescope configuration and use. 8: Mirrored telescopes, Newtonian telescope, Gregory's telescope, example telescopes. 8: Microscopes, simple and compound, field of view and magnification, objective and ocular combinations, chromatic and spherical aberration correction, illumination methods, mirrored microscopes, solar microscope. 9: Instrument making, optical glass, glass properties, lens grinding, figuring and polishing, machine and hand work, mirror making. Most sections begin with a general description, invoking only simple geometry, followed in some cases by formulae and worked examples using real data. Virtually all the material is geometrical optics; phenomena important for instruments are described without any attempt to invoke physical optics for explanation. Analytical results, such as lens specifications, from other works are presented without derivation.","<i>Carl Zeiss: A Biography 1816‚Äì1888<i>|Wimmer, W., Paetrow, S.|Zeiss Archives, 2016, 144 pp, NB: pp 61-62.",****,"Optik, Catoptrik und Dioptrik oder theoretisch-praktischer Unterricht uÃàber den moÃàglichst vollkommenen Bau aller optischen Instrumente, besonders aller Arten von FernroÃàhren und Microscopen, nebst Angabe der praktischen Hilfsmittel zur technsichen AusfuÃàhrung derselben.

Gustav Radicke produced this two-volume compendium to provide a detailed, mathematical description of the wave theory of light. He makes clear that since the time of Malus' discovery of polarization by reflection, the development of wave theory had been extensive and rapid, but the original works were hard to acquire, other books were insufficiently detailed, and the most rest developments had seen little recognition. Radicke's approach was entirely theoretical, coming to his subject as a mathematician with the task of accommodating the wave theory of light to experimental facts of optical phenomena. Radicke attempts to accommodate virtually all optical phenomena, and his list includes those described in the stream of journal articles produced by the unwearying David Brewster. One of nine parts of the two volume work deals with practical matters: optical instruments, with descriptions of applications of theory to image formation that are, as is the rest of the work, of dense and deep concision.
","Radicke's two volumes encompass nine parts. 1: Laws of motion of homogeneous light. 2: Light propagation at media transitions. 3: Interference phenomena. 4: Interference phenomena due to unequal paths. 5: Reflection and Refraction. 6: Absorption. 7: Physiological optics. 8: Meteorological optics. 9: Optical instruments. The first two parts present a full development of the wave theory of light. Most of Parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 are devoted to applications of the theory to account for a long list of laboratory experimental results that reveal a particular optical phenomena. Parts 7, 8, and 9 apply wave theory to natural phenomena. The material is detailed and highly analytic.","Radicke, F. W.

Fran√ßois Arago had adapted the rotating mirror apparatus invented in 1834 by Charles Wheatstone to determine the relative speeds of light in air and water. Faster/Slower for the wave supposition, Slower/Faster for the corpuscular. Arago's health was failing and his experimental worked ceased, but he challenged Fizeau and Foucault to devise their own experiments to settle this question. Foucault, assisted with instrument maker Paul-Gustave Froment, and Fizeau with Louis Breguet, began the competition to determine the relative speeds of light in air and water. Foucault obtained his results and reported them to the French Academy one week before Fizeau in 1850. Foucault used this experiment as the basis for his thesis submitted toward the <i>Docteur √®s Sciences<i> degree at the Sorbonne in 1853.","Foucault used a rotating mirror to provide for the comparison of two images of a single solar-illuminated aperture, each image produced by light traversing the same path length but one path was in air and the other had a portion of it in water. If the speed of light in water was faster or slow than that in air, the two images would appear shifted. Foucault's experiment gave a speed lower in water, and so favoring the hypothesis that light is a wave. The apparatus could not determine the absolute speeds of light, since it was not possible to accurate know the rotation speed of the mirror. Interestingly, both Foucault's and Fizeau's experiment could only be conducted in clear weather, as the Sun was required as a light source - the three meters of water used in one of the light-paths absorbed too much light to permit the use of any less powerful light source.","‚ÅÇ 'Toothed wheels and rotating mirrors: Parisian astronomy and mid-nineteenth century experimental measurements of the speed of light'|Tobin, W.|<i>Vistas in Astronomy<i>, Vol 30, No 3, 1993, pp 253-294.",****,"Methode g√©n√©rale pour measurer la vitesse de la lumi√®re dans l'air and les milieux transparents.

"Stokes, George Gabriel",George Gabriel Stokes,," ",1819-1903,,," ",On the Change of Refrangility of Light,"Stokes discovers, investigates, and charaterizes fluorescence.","The seeming ability of certain liquids to produce two colors of light from one, had been known since Kircher described the phenomena using an extract of 'lignum nephriticum' in his <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae<i> of 1646. Though there was considerable interest in this phenomenon during the late 17th century, during the 18th century the phenomenon was eclipsed in importance by other optical questions. But at the beginning of 19th century, crystalline minerals such as fluorspar, were found to behave as did the solutions. It was initially thought the the additional color of light was produced by some type of scattering or dispersion. But Stokes showed the light to be a true emission, brought about by the action of incident light. This is now recognized as a type of phosphorescence of short duration. Stokes coined the term 'fluorescence' from the fluorspar used in his experiments.||Stokes noticed and described that the emitted light was always 'degraded'--that is, had longer wavelengths than the incident light. This became known as Stokes' Law of Fluorescence.' The shift in wavelength of the incident to the fluorescently emitted light came to be called the 'Stokes Shift.' Stokes' paper initiated wide-spread interest in fluorescence experimentation in the second half of the 19th century, notably by Eugen von Lommel. Stokes paper established the modern field of luminescence.","Stokes' paper was 100 pages long and one of the most thorough on the subject. It is based on earlier work of the mineralogist  Ren√© Just Ha√ºy, and that of John Herschel, and David Brewster. Stokes described two methods to study the phosphorescent phenomenon he called 'fluorescence.' The first used filters to select incident and detect fluorescently emitted light. The second was spectrographic: prismatic dispersion was used to select the illuminating light and observe any fluorescently emitted light. It was the second method that clearly showed the universality of the long wavelength shift of the emitted light. A solution of quinine showed this phenomena in a spectacular way: A test tube of solution glowed blue when illuminated by ultra-violet light.||Stokes experiments were very complete, studying the spectrum of fluorescently emitted light, the types and amplitude of fluorescence produced by various input spectra, the effect of various sources (such as electric sparks), the effect of concentration on amplitude of fluorescence, so-called quenching, and produced a long list of substances that fluoresced.

"Lissajous, Jules Antoine",Jules Antoine Lissajous,," ",1822-1880,,," ",Memoire sur Etude optique,Lissajous's description of his figures that display in a concise way magnitude and phase of vibrations,"Lissajous was interested in demonstrating vibrations in way that were not did require the sense of hearing. This long article is his most important research, and describes his invention of a way to study acoustic vibrations by reflecting a light beam from the vibrating object onto a screen. The shapes came to be called Lissajous Figures and display in a concise way the frequency, phase, and amplitude of vibrations. This is an early example of the application of optics to use light as an investigative tool.
","Lissajous produced two kinds of luminous curves. In the first kind, light is reflected from a tuning fork with a small mirror is attached and then from a large mirror that is rotated rapidly. The second kind of curve, named the 'Lissajous Figure,' is more useful and is still used in many acoustical applications. The light beam is successively reflected from mirrors on two forks that are vibrating about mutually perpendicular axes. Persistence of vision causes various curves, whose shapes depend on the relative frequency, phase, and amplitude of the forks' vibrations. Lissajous presents the mathematics that define the curves and from that develops concise ways to specify characteristics of the vibrations based on the number, orientation, ellipticity, and size of the loops of the figures. These are Lissajous curves. The memoire is accompanied by two large plates, the first showing the apparatus and the second showing the figures produced by various sounds.","<i>Adventures with Lissajous Figures<i>|Greenslade, T.|IOP ebooks, 2018, NB: pp 2.1 - 2.14.",****,"Memoire sur Etude optique des mouvements vibratoires.

","F√©lix Billet's 1200-page <i>Trait√©<i> is one of the last, extensive expositions of physical optics before the advance of the theory of electromagnetic fields. Billet excludes catoptrics, dioptrics, geometrical optics and aberrations, which he labels 'Old Optics' and also mentions his exclusion of Photometry, traditionally considered part of optics, but now left behind by developments in optics. Perhaps appropriately, he considers the development of the wave theory of light as a renewal of optics; beginning with Malus's discovery of polarization by reflection and then covering virtually all aspects of the subsequent development of the theory. Unlike some of the equally lengthy compendia of optics, the Trait√© has a unifying structure that topical and ordered from the fundamental to the complex, rather than chronological. Billet wrote his <i>Trait√©<i> to unify all the various data, equations, and phenomena in optics in the previous 30 years, providing for the mathematically-capable student a complete overview of wave optics. Among he several conceptual innovations was the coherence and incoherence of light--terms is first introduced. With this work, Billet established his reputation in the field of optics.
","Bilett's <i>Traite<i> is in 24 chapters with additional notes. 1: Fundamental concepts including wave movement, propagation speed, amplitude. 2: Fundamental constants of optics including the speed of light in various media, wavelength, analogy with sound, Doppler effect. 3: Wave motion. 4:  Interference of unpolarized light including colors of thin plates and Newton's rings. 5: Diffraction including Fresnel's work and Schwerd's diffraction calculations and experiments. 6: Double refraction including its crystal geometry and analysis. 7: Linear polarization phenomena. 8: Modern optical instruments based on the 'new optics.' 9: Linear polarization theory for reflection and refraction. 10: Interference of polarized light. 11: Production and phenomena of circularly and elliptically polarized light. 12: Theory of circularly and elliptically polarized light. 13: Circularly and elliptically polarized light by total internal reflection. 14: Circularly and elliptically polarized light by reflection at metal and glass. 15: Linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized light by crystalline reflection. 16: Measurement of polarization characteristics. 17: Circular double refraction. 18: Rotary chromatic polarization. 19: Chromatic polarization of circularly, and elliptically polarized light. 20: Rotary polarization experiments including magnetic polarization rotation. 21: Rotary polarization and chemistry. 22: Rotary polarization and crystallography. 23: Experimental methods of de S√©narmont. 24: Elliptical double refraction in quartz. 25: Theory of double refraction including conical refraction. Chapters 1 through 10 cover the more fundamental aspects of light's wave theory. In these early chapters Billet often provides historical commentary regarding the development and reception of the then-revolutionary ideas. Chapters 11 through 25 become increasingly narrower in scope, greater in detail, and generally more arcane. The overall work is highly detailed and analytic.","<i>History of the Principle of Interference of Light<i>|Kipnis, N.|Springer, Basel, 1991, 271 pp, NB pp 124, 236-237.",****,"Traite d'Optique Physique, Par M.F.

","Charles Briot essays take up four topics within the wave theory of light, beginning with the pioneering work of Cauchy.","Briot's four essays cover the following. 1: General laws of vibratory motion, including plane waves, presumed properties of the luminiferous aether as 3-dimentionl lattice, integration of the governing differential equations. 2: Double refraction including vibratory motion in crystals with single and double axes. 3: Dispersion of light including changes of light-speed based on wavelength. 4: Circular polarization including vibratory motion in asymmetric media, crystals and circular polarization. Briot is a mathematician, not an optician, and so brings his considerable mathematical skills to bear on the four topics he considered with the abstraction of a mathematician. But he attempts to secure the validity and utility of his mathematical models by comparison with experimental data. Such as the comparison he make between the predictions of his elaborate, 5-th order approximation for polarization rotation and the otherwise inexplicable rotation data obtained with tartaric acid. To all but those possessing considerable skill in differential and integral calculus, the presentation is all but impenetrable.","‚ÅÇ Optics and the Theory of the Punctiform Ether|Buchwald, J.Z.|<i>Archive for History of Exact Sciences<i>, Vol 21, 1980, pp 245-274.",****,"Essais sur la theÃÅorie matheÃÅmatique de la lumieÃÄre.

It was a reprint summary of work that had appeared in the Abhandlungen der K√∂niglichen Preu√üischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin. In this, the third edition, Kirchhoff modified his proof and explanation of his law of thermal radiation. In the reprint he laid down the first principles of chemical analysis by luminous spectrum and presented his interpretation of the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum as markers of chemicals in the sun's hot inner core and its outer cooler sheath. Kirchhoff‚Äôs work was a startling and unexpected development, revealed a method for chemical analysis at a distance, and was the first evidence of how light was to become an investigative tool of science.

","Gustav Kirchhoff brief treatise is in four parts with an appendix. 1: The solar spectrum. 2: Reversal of a flame spectrum. 3: Chemical composition of the sun's atmosphere. 4: Physical nature of the sun. Kirchhoff presents an explanation for the appearance of dark Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum: chemical elements (and some compounds) emit a unique signature of spectral lines when hot and absorb those same lines when cooler. The 'reversal of spectra' to is how absorption spectra were referred to; they absorbed rather than emitted.  Kirchhoff's experiments with Robert Bunsen created a link between the chemical elements, known and unknown, and a signature of spectral lines that could be detected with a spectrograph. The reprint contains a plate showing the instrument devised by Kirchhoff for this work, along with elaborate mappings of the solar spectrum, Fraunhofer lines, and the chemical elements and compounds associated with them.","A Century of Spectrum Analysis|Shpol'ski, √â.V., Beyer, R.T., translator|<i>Soviet Physics Uspekhi<i>, Vo. 2, No 6, 1960  958-973.||<i>The Synthesis of the Elements: The Astrophysical Quest for Nucleosynthesis and what it Can Tell Us about the Universe<i>|Shaviv, G.|Springer, 2012, 683 pp, NB: pp 76-89.",****,"Untersuchungen uber das Sonnenspectrum und de Spectren der Chemischen Elemente. von G.

This is the first edition in book form, published with Airy's approval. Given the scope and intent of the work, the content is little changed from that in the Essay. Airy wrote on the wave theory of light with the same certainty of correctness with which he held the theory of gravity. He held the wave theory of light to be  '... certainly true, and that, by mathematical operations of general elegance, it leads to results of great interest. With regard to the evidence for this theory; if the simplicity of a hypothesis, which explains with accuracy a vast variety of phaenomena of the most complicated kind, can be considered a proof of its correctness, I believe there is no physical theory so firmly established as the theory in question.' Airy was one of the earliest British natural philosophers to accept the wave theory and he wrote extensively in its support. The current essay brought together aspects of the theory Airy considered to be its core, and presented them with his typical clear yet detailed manner. He believed that experimental data and phenomena needed to be considered along with mathematical theory; to that end Airy personally performed each experiment described in the essay. Interestingly, Airy separates the simpler assumptions  in the theory that have proven to be powerfully predictive--transverse waves, varying speeds, and such, all of which he calls the geometrical part of the wave theory--from what he calls the mechanical part of the theory--Cauchy's assumption of the aether as a 3-dimentional lattice and everything that followed from that. That later he considered probable but 'far from certain.' The title pages labels this 'A New Edition', though it is essentially a reprint of that of 1866. Editions appeared in 1866, 1877, and 1887.
","Airy's book is in several unlabeled sections. 1: General theory of undulations including the theory and mathematics of waves, wave interference, wave length, wave phase. 2: Application of wave theory to unpolarized light, including diffraction pattern positions and intensities, wave fronts, reflection, refraction, reflection and refraction both, unequal (chromatic) refraction.  3: Experiments involving optical phenomena including interference fringes, chromatic interference, prismatic interference, phase shifting with glass plates, thin plates, Newton's rings, diffraction fringes, diffraction from a rectangular aperture, colored fringes, lenses and apertures and wire gratings, diffraction spectra. 4: Double refraction including crystal properties, experiments with polarized light, relation to the hypothesis of the nature of light, transverse waves, general explanation of double refraction, conical refraction. 5: Aspects of the wave theory including predicted values of reflection from glass, total internal reflection, circularly and elliptically polarized light, reflection from metals, colored polarization, polarization in crystals with multiple axes. The material is detailed and highly analytic, with experimental optical phenomena and mathematical developments closely coupled.","The Reception of the Wave Theory of Light in Britain: A Case Study Illustrating the Role of Methodology in Scientific Debate|Canntory G.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 6, 1975, pp 109-132.",****,On the Undulatory Theory of Optics,,1877,1875-1900,"British mathematician, astronomer.

"Thomson, William",William Thomson,Lord Kelvin,Also Known As: Lord Kelvin,1824-1907,,," ",Notes of lectures on molecular dynamics and the wave theory of light,"Copy of the original, 'papyrographically' reproduced notes of William Thomson's presentations at a course of invited lectures by Thomson in Baltimore in 1884, stenographically prepared by a participant.","The occasion for these lectures was an invitation by Robert H. Gilman, then president of Johns Hopkins University, to William Thomson to present lectures on a topic of Thompson's choosing. He lectured on the wave theory of light, emphasizing it's incompleteness and faults. The idea was not to denigrate the theory but to challenge the attendees. This was what would now be called a master-class and the attendees were advanced students, professionals, and seasoned academics. A.A. Michelson and E.W. Morley were in the audience and the problems and uncertainties set out by Thomson prompted them to conduct the famed eponymous Michelson-Morley Experiment. Thomson focused on the the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation, and the nature of the medium, the luminiferous aether, that would be required to support such oscillations.||Arthur S. Hathaway, student at Johns Hopkins at the time and later instructor at Cornell, attended the meeting and, since Thomson provided no public notes, Hathaway recorded the entire proceedings, mathematics and all, in stenographic short-hand. He later transcribed his short-hand into a 328 page text with tables and index. onto the stencils required of the so-called papyrograph process for quick and low-cost reproduction. Copies of these reproduced notes appeared in December of 1884 and  were widely circulated. The demand was great enough for Hathaway to contact Thomson, attempting to arrange for letter-press printing. After long delays and revisions by Thomson, the notes finally appeared in printed form in 1904.||Thomson's lectures were delivered at the beginning of the twenty-year period in which physicists strove to rectify theory and experiment, all based on the presence of the luminiferous aether. By the time the printed version of the notes appeared, Thomson would consider most problems solved or soluble by the application of dynamics, save for one: the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment which had been conducted in 1887. Thomson wrote in the preface to the 1904 printing of the lecture notes: 'All of us will, I am sure, feel sympathetically interested in knowing that two of ourselves, Michelson and Morley, have by their great experimental work on the motion of ether relative to earth, raised the one and only serious objection against our dynamical explanations.' Thomson's lectures are one of the last, great summaries of classical physics and aether-based light-theory before the coming of relativity and the quantum revolution.
","Thomsos's lectures stated and attempted to solve the known problems regarding light's propagation and other optical phenomena. He delivered 20 lectures. Lecture 1 on kinetic theory of gases, molecular dynamics (vortex atoms), wave theory of light and its difficulties, mechanical models. Lecture 2 on motion of elastic solids (the aether). Lecture 3 on isotropic elastic solids. Lecture 4 on motion in elastic solids. Lecture 5 on vibrating globes. Lecture 6 on velocity. Lecture 7 on dispersion. Lecture 8 on other dynamic solutions. Lecture 9 on light properties. Lecture 10 on plane waves. Lecture 11 more on elastic solids. Lecture 12 more on wave motion. Lecture 13 on mechanical models of molecules (the aether). Lecture 14 more on molecules. Lecture 15 more on molecules. Lecture 16 on double refraction. Lecture 17 on polarization. Lecture 18 on the theory of reflection and refraction. Lecture 19 problem solutions. Lecture 20 additional difficulties and summary.||Lectures 1-5 set out the dynamical properties of the presumed aether. Molecular dynamics is invoked, together with the presumed nature of the aether, to explain reflection, refraction, dispersion. Along the way, the difficulties are highlighted. Before the lecture notes appeared in their printed form, Thomson had revised lectures 12-15 and rewrote lectures 18-20, incorporating newer work, and adding to the completeness of his dynamical theory.","Energy, dynamics, hidden machinery: Rankine, Thomson and Tait, Maxwell|Moyer, D.F.|<i>Studies in History and Philosophy of Science<i> Part A, Vol 8, No 3, 1977, pp 251-268.||Continuum mechanics and field theory: Thomson and Maxwell|Moyer, D.F.|<i>Studies in History and Philosophy of Science<i> Part A, Vol 9, No 1, 1979, pp 35-50.",****,"Notes of lectures on molecular dynamics and the wave theory of light.

"Kirchhoff, Gustav",Gustav Kirchhoff,," ",1824-1887,Kurt Hensel,e,Edited by Kurt Hensel,Vorlesungen uber Mathematische Optik,"An editing of notes from the lectures Gustav Kirchhoff gave on physical optics at the University of Berlin. ","Kurt Hensel edited these notes from the lectures Gustav Kirchhoff gave on physical optics at the University of Berlin. Kirchhoff had hoped to publish the lectures of all his courses on mathematical physics, but only that on mechanics appeared before his death. Hensel's editing benefited from elaboration, review, and notes from Kirchhoff's former pupils. Hensel was meticulous regarding the lectures and only modified what was to appear in print when it seemed essential; and even then, he noted what he had changed in the book‚Äôs appendix. Interestingly, Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism is not mentioned. These notes on mathematical optics appeared in 1891 and again in 1897 when all of Kirchhoff's mathematical physics notes were published as <i>Vorlesungen √ºber Mathematische Physik<i>.
","The book presents Kirchhoff's thirteen lectures in physical optics. 1: General overview of undulation theory, transvers waves, interference, polarization. 2: Propagation of light. 3: Reflected light, image formation. 4: Refraction of light, image formation, magnification, spherical aberration. 5: Diffraction, Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction, various apertures. 6: Fraunhofer diffraction, diffraction gratings, diffraction spectra. 7: Mathematics of slit diffraction. 8: Polarization by reflection and refraction, linear polarization, amplitude of reflection. 9: Polarization by thin plates. 10: Absorption and dispersion, spectral analysis, Cauchy's theory of the aether. 11: Birefringence, crystals. 12: Rays in a crystalline medium, direction and propagation, multi-axis crystals. 13: Reflection and refraction and crystal boundaries. Kirchhoff's treatment is entirely mathematical, consulting experimental results as way to verify mathematical predictions.

","In 1889 A.A. Michelson and E.W. Morely published their article 'On the feasibility of establishing a light-wave as the ultimate standard of length' in the American Journal of Science. Between 1890 and 1892 Michelson experimented with the interferometer developed for the Michelson-Morley experiment, seeking a way to use it to count the number of waves of light in the standard meter. It was necessary that the light source be stable, emit light of the narrowest possible wavelength spread, and be extremely coherent. Eventually, the red line emitted by cadmium vapor was found satisfactory and in 1892 Michelson succeeded in determining the length of the International Prototype Meter at the US National Bureau of Standards in terms of cadmium's red-line wavelength. The interferometer developed by Michelson for this work eventually became the standard instrument for measuring lengths and was adopted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The 1907 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Michelson 'for his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid.'
","Michelson's text is in 5 parts and six appendices. I: Introduction, II: Theory. III: Description of the apparatus. IV: Methods of observation.

"Czapski, Siegfried",Siegfried Czapski,," ",1861-1907,,," ",Optischen Instrumenten,"A revision and extension of a detailed, highly technical handbook of optical instrument design and practice that first appeared in 1893. Based on the work of Ernst Abbe at the Zeiss optical works in Jena.
","Siegfried Czapski became assistant to Ernst Abbe at the Zeiss optical works in Jena in 1886. With the approval of the Zeiss brothers, Czapski became Abbe's most trusted assistant, working with Abbe on the many projects and developments at Zeiss. Czapski began work on an optical treatise in 1888, Abbe having neither time nor interest in writing up his theoretical and practical developments. Czapski's treatise appeared 5 years later in two forms: as a contribution to Adolf Winkelmann's Handbuch der Physik and as a separated publication. It was immediately recognized as a major work in technological and instrumentational optics.||Czapski states his purpose in writing the book in his Forward: 'to communicate that which, in my opinion, can not be found elsewhere more completely and coherently; to mention only what is essential, and for my special purpose, of what is necessary; and to offer merely a literature reference for the study of these fields of geometric optics. Czapski presents Abbe's theory of optical images in dioptric systems--which included the effects of diffraction--but states that he does not present Abbe's later general theory of diffraction since it would take too much and it was Abbe's intention to produce such a work himself. Abbe's theory of optical imaging revolutionized microscopy in the late 19th century.||A revised version of Czapski's book appeared in 1904 and again in 1924. This revision follows the structure and intent of the 1893 text closely. Each of the original chapters was edited and revised by a specialist on the Zeiss staff. Chapters one, three, and four were revised only slightly. The others were updated more extensively, accounting for the developments in the decade since the text first appeared.","The book is in nine Sections. L Geometric optics, II. Geometric theory of optical imaging after Abbe. III. Realization of an optical image. IV. Spherical aberrations. V. Chromatic aberrations in dioptric systems and the theory of achromatism. VI. Prisms and prism systems. VII. The limitation of the rays and their dependent properties of the optical instruments. VIII. Main types of optical instruments including projection systems, microscopes, and telescopes. IX. Methods for the empirical determination of optical instrument constants.||Czapski presents Abbe's theory of optical images and its use in optical instrument design. This includes consideration of spherical and chromatic aberrations. These general results are then used to generate a particular theory of optical instruments which, in turn, is then applied to the principal types considered: the eye, projection system, magnifying glass, microscopes, and telescopes. In each of these instruments, the basic dioptric function is described and the factors on which it depends are characterized. These are the optical instrument constants considered in the last section of the book.","Ernst Abbe and the Foundation of Scientific Microscopes|Masters, B.R.|<i>Optics & Photonics News<i>, February 2007.",****,Die Bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten vom Standpunkte der geometrischen Optik,Imagining in Optical Instruments from the Standpoint of Geometrical Optics,1904,1900-1925,"German optician, instrument maker, optical historian.

A thorough introduction to geometric and physical optics in the mature and post-electron-discovery era of Maxwell‚Äôs theory of electromagnetism and sits on the cusp between it and the advent of quantum optics just five years later.
","Paul Karl Ludwig Drude was asked by the publisher to produce an advanced, comprehensive textbook on optics, in the spirit of Mascart's <i>Trait√© D'Optique<i> of 1889. Drude agreed that a modern optics text was needed and even though, when the book was finished, he said 'I can make no claim to the completeness of the excellent textbook of Mascart . . .', his book was widely used, praised, and translated. Drude's text is a thorough introduction to physical optics in the mature and post-electron-discovery era of Maxwell‚Äôs theory of electromagnetism and sits on the cusp between it and the advent of quantum optics just five years later. In that regard, Drude describes the null result of Michelson's and Morley's experiment to detect the luminiferous aether in 1887 and he follows this with an explanation of the startling proposition of Lorentz and Fitzgerald that the length of a solid body may depend upon its absolute motion in space. Though Einstein‚Äôs suggestion of light quanta would eventually revolutionize physical optics, the mathematical power of the electromagnetic theory remained, and still remains, important in optics. Drude's book would not be superseded until Max Born's <i>Optik: Ein Lehrbuch der Elektromagnetischen Lichttheorie<i> of 1933. Editions appeared in 1900 and 1906, An English translations appeared in 1902, 1905, and 1907, and reissued in 1917, 1922 and 1959, a French edition was published in 1911.
","Drude's optics textbook is in two parts, Geometric Optics (104 pages) and Physical Optics (395 pages). Drude leans heavily on Siegfried Czapski's <i>Theorie der Optischen Instrumente<i> of 1893 for his material on Geometrical Optics in five chapters. 1: Fundamental experiments and laws. 2: Geometric optical imaging. 3: Images by mirrors and lenses. 4: Vison, photometry, and images. 5: Optical instruments. The Physical Optics part is in three sections: General Properties of Light, Optical Properties of Bodies, Radiation from Bodies. General properties include: Propagation and speed, interference, Huygens principle, refraction, polarization. Optical Properties include the theory of light, transparent bodies, optical properties of crystals, absorbing bodies, dispersion, optically-active bodies, magnetically-active bodies, moving bodies. Radiation from bodies includes energy interpretation of radiation, thermodynamics applied to blackbody radiation, glow of gases. ","<i>The Theory of Optics, By Paul Drude.
