"Pierre de Limoges, OFM","Limoges, Pierre de OFM",,c1250-1306," ",De oculo morali,"A preacher's homiletic guide that uses the nature of eye and vision described in Alhacen's <i>De Aspectibus<i> as a basis for similes of the moral life.

","<i>De Oculo Morali<i> by Peter of Limoges is a Franciscan exemplum book; that is, a preacher's homiletic guide containing an anthology of illustrations and examples for homilies. Written late in the 13th century, this important training manual for preachers was produced in the hope making homilies interesting and relevant by making moral parallels and allegories to the principal aspects of Perspectiva‚Äîthe medieval study encompassing the eye, vision, and optics. Perspectiva originated with De Aspectibus, the Latin translation of Katib al-Manazir by the great Arabic scholar Ab≈´  øAlƒ´ al-·∏§asan ibn al-·∏§asan ibn al-Haytham, known as Alhazen in the Latin West. Much of the natural philosophy of vision in the Katib al-Manazir found its way into the De Oculo Morali, via De Aspectibus, becoming similes for the moral life. The book is important as it reveals what was commonly know from the Latin translation of ibn al-Haytham's Katib al-Manazir, giving one aspect of the depth and extent of its influence. More startling is what it shows a preacher's audience could be expected to be familiar with and grasp and, evidently, how common was a general understanding of vision and the eye.||<i>De Oculo Morali<i> is part of a wider tradition of exempla books and is similar to the <i>Lumen Animae<i> attributed to Berengar of Landora, Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela. The <i>Lumen Animae<i> uses natural history and source including Avicenna, Galen, Hippocrates, Pliny the elder, and Theophrastus of Eresus in the same way that the <i>De Oculo Morali<i> uses Alhazen and the De Aspectibus.||<i>De Oculo Morali<i> was widely copied, circulated, and used for more than two centuries. More than 160 manuscript copies still exist. By way of its popularization in homilies of the new natural philosophy in Perspectiva, it was responsible for the spread of perspectivist ideas to a much wider audience than any of the specialized texts of Peckham, Bacon, or Witelo.||The earliest printings appeared at Augsburg in 1475, 1476, and 1477. An edition of the Latin text, and an Italian translation based on it, appeared at Venice in 1496.
","The <i>De Oculo Morali<i> contains 15 chapters. 1: The anatomy of the eye; relating its seven components to the seven virtues. 2: Alignment of the type of eye component (soft or hard) with aspects of mercy and justice. 3: Enunciates the three types of vision: direct, reflected, refracted. Each with a lessened ability to convey veracity, and related to spiritual vision. 4: Claims that both intromission (species of objects coming into the eye) and extramission (vision rays leaving the eye) are required for sight. This is aligned with the requirement for the requirement of an individual‚Äôs cooperation with God‚Äôs grace. 5: The role of the single nerve behind the eye (after the optic chiasm) as the seat of vision. The brain is presented having an internal sense that acts as vision‚Äôs gatekeeper. 6: Explains 13 optical illusions, with moral and spiritual illusions being paired with physical and optical ones. 7: From the 12 ‚Äònatural properties‚Äô of the eye (such as the fact that it is spherical), Limoges builds a system of moral instruction. 8: Characterizes types of eyes with types of sin. 9: How the eyes incur more debt than other parts of the body. 10: Loss and damage to vision 11: Seven conditions necessary for vision in the instruction of students. 12: From the 12 ‚Äònatural properties‚Äô of the eye, develops instruction for priests. 13: The four appropriate objects of spiritual vision. 14: Beautiful visual experiences interpreted in spiritual terms. 15: Divine sight, the eye and vision of God.||Peter of Limoges is interested in aspects of vision beyond their utility for moral allegory. This is clear from Chapter 1 where he gives a description of the eye, together with a brief account of eye diseases and their treatment, as well as Chapter 3 devoted to vision. It is also apparent in the chapter on optical illusions where what was understood about refraction at the time is considered in detail. In general, though, the <i>De Oculo Morali<i> extracts and uses only the qualitative and descriptive aspects of Alhazen's <i>De Aspectibus<i>. Not surprisingly, none of its elaborate mathematics or optical experiments appears in the <i>De Oculo Morali<i>.","‚ÅÇùëª  <i>Peter of Limoges The Moral Treatise on the Eye<i>|Newhauser, R.G., translator|Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 2012||Optics for preachers: The De oculo morali of Peter of Limoges|Clark, D.

Bartholomaeus Anglicus OFM,Bartholomaeus Anglicus OFM,,c1190-1272," ",De proprietatibus Rerum,"One of the most widely read Medieval encyclopedias. Written for students and preachers, it covered divine and human life, the natural world, Earth and the heavens, with numerous sources cited.

","The <i>De proprietatibus Rerum<i> of Bartholomaeus Anglicus (Bartholomew the Englishman) is one of the most widely read Medieval encyclopedias and one of the most frequently printed. Written for students and preachers no later than 1240, it covered divine and human life, the natural world, Earth and the heavens. Bartholomew's encyclopedia filled a need for a compact source of knowledge for those without access to libraries or large specialized textbooks. One of the reasons it was immensely popular for centuries was that is was not a manual of the arts but a source for 'science' and secular knowledge; there are more than 200 manuscript copies extant. Nevertheless, Bartholomew wrote not to consider the nature of things for their own sake, but rather to better reveal Scripture. The book gives a view of middle and late medieval common knowledge and because Bartholomew did not consider nor wish to present himself as an authority, the many sources he cites gives insight into information and texts available at end of the 13th century. The book was popular enough to be translated into French in 1372 by Jean Corbichon, into English in 1398 by John Trevisa, into Spanish by Vincent de Burgos late in the 14th century, and into Dutch, Italian, and Proven√ßal.||Latin editions appeared in ca 1472, ca 1475, 1480, 1481, two in 1482, 1483, 1485, 1488, 1491, 1492, 1505, 1519, 1601, and 1609. French editions appeared in 1482, two in 1485, 1487, 1491, 1500, 1510, 1518, 1522 (2), 1525, 1538, 1539, six in 1556. A Dutch printing appeared in 1485. A Spanish printing in 1494 and 1529. Printed editions appeared in England in 1495, 1535, and 1582; the later being Thomas Berthelet's English edition, amended and enlarged by Stephen Batman. The present copy and is number 6 in Voight's bibliographic list.
","<i>De Proprietatibus Rerum<i> contains 19 books. 1: God. 2: Angels and demons. 3: Psychology. 4-5: Physiology. 6: Family life and domestic economy. 7: Medicine. 8: Cosmology and astrology. 9: Time divisions. 10: Form and matter, the elements. 11: Air and meteorology, 12: Flying creatures. 13: Waters and fishes, dolphins, and whales. 14-15: Physical and political geography. 16: Gems, minerals, and metals. 17: Trees and herbs. 18: Animals. 19: Color, odor, savor; food and drink; weights and measures; musical instruments. All of the material in Chapter 17 of Book 3 is on vision, giving the anatomy of the eye and detailed account of the mechanism of vision. Bartholomew gives an unnamed author's work precedence over that of Constantine the African on matters of vision. Presumably this is a reference to Constantine's translation, the<i>Liber Pantegni<i>, of an Arabic medical text. The unnamed author and work cannot be Alhazen and <i>De Apsectibus<i>; it is likely to be Robert Grosseteste since as his source Bartholomew cites the the first chapter of 'Perspectiva' and, importantly, describes the multiplication of visible species. Bartholomew presents vision based on three coincident pyramids, with apex at the pupil and base at the viewed object. The three pyramids contain: species emitted from the object, a visual fluid emitted by the eye, and light--a substance illuminating the object. Though Light is always present, it illuminates only a body in a condition to receive it. Following the ancients, three types of vision are presented: direct, reflected, and refracted.||The eye and ocular anatomy is presented in Chapters 5, 6, and 7 of Book 5. The material comes from Isidore of Saville's <i>Etymologiae<i> and from the medical translations of Constantine the African (the <i>Liber Pantegni<i>, most likely), both of which are cited. The anatomy presented is entirely Galenic. Bartholomew's material on color in chapter 1 of book 19 is copied, almost verbatim, from Robert Grosseteste's <i>De Colore<i> of around 1220. In all, the <i>De Proprietatibus Rerum<i> contains a summary of the developments in optics up to the end of the 13th century. Rays, pyramids, and species are presented with the mixed vagueness typical before the wide-spread appearance  Alhacen's <i>De Aspectibus<i> in the Latin West at the very beginning of the 14th century.

Plotinus,Plotinus,,c 205-270,"Translated by Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499) priest and important Florentine scholar, translator of Plato's works.",Opera,"The first printing of the works of Plotinus, gathered together by his disciple Porphyry and here translated and with commentary by Marsilio Ficino. This printing was the primary document of Neoplatonism and had an important role in the revival of Plato in the Renaissance.","This printing of Plotinus' works, translated and edited with commentary by Marsilio Ficino, marks their reappearance in the Latin West. Before this, Plotinus was virtually unknown; none of his works had been translated, and early translations had been lost. The printing was made possible by the emergence of two manuscripts of Plotinus in the early fifteenth century in Florence. The second had come from Constantinople and was eventually owned by Cosimo de 'Medici who gave it to Ficino in 1462. Though Ficino appears to have worked with the manuscript for nearly 20 years, it was only after finishing his grand project of translating all of Plato in 1484 that he returned to the Plotinus translation and commentary project, producing the present edition. The book was two years in press.||From his Preface, it is clear than Ficino considers Plotinus the supreme interpreter of Plato and that Platonic ideas presage Christian ones. The availability of Plotinus' <i>Enneads<i> brought about a revival of Neoplatonism in Renaissance Europe and producing a confluence of Platonic philosophy and Christianity would become a major project of European scholarship in the 16th century.||Editions appeared at Florence in 1492, at Sollingen in 1542, at Basel in 1559, 1562, 1576, and 1641, at Basel with the Greek in 1580 and 1615, at Hamburg in 1711, 1723, 1796, in a French translation at Paris in 1747, in a German translation at Frankfurt in 1805, and an English translation at London in 1817.","The divisions and labeling of the Enneads were introduced by Ficino and are still used. There are VI Enneads, each having 9 Tracts. Their subject range and complexity is suggested by their titles. Ennead I: Animate man, Virtue, On Dialectic, On true happiness, Happiness and time, Beauty, Primal Good, Nature and source of Evil, Dismissal of the Soul. Ennead II: On the cosmos, Heavenly circuit, Starts as causes, Two kinds of matter, Potentiality and Actuality, Quality and form, Transfusion, Why distant object appear small, Against the Gnostics. Ennead III: Fate, Providence 1, Providence 2, Teaching Spirit, Love, Impassivity of the unembodied, Time and Eternity, Nature Contemplation and the One, Detached considerations. Ennead IV: Essence of the Soul 1, Essence of the Soul 2, Problems of the Soul 1, Problems of the Soul 2, Problems of the Soul 3 ('On sight'), Perception and Memory, Immortality of the Soul, Soul's decent in the Body, Are all Souls one?. Ennead V: Three initial Hypostases, Origin and Order of Beings, Knowing Hypostases and the Transcendent, How Secondaries rise from the First, Intellectual Beings and the Nature of the Good, Principle Transcending Being has no Intellectual Act, Is there an ideal Archetype?, Intellectual Beauty, Authentic Existence. Ennead VI: On kinds of Being 1, On kinds of Being 2, On kinds of Being 3, Omnipresence of the Authentic Existent 1, Omnipresence of the Authentic Existent 2, On Numbers, How Multiplicity of Ideal-Forms Arose, Free Will and the Will of the One, On The Good, or The One.||The treatise that forms Ennead IV, Tract 5, came to be known as 'On Sight.' In it, the Soul is described as the animator of inanimate body and how it functions as the active receptor of the senses. Plotinus then gives a refutation of both Aristotle's and Plato's theory of vision. Importantly, Light is described as the radiant <i>activity<i> of a luminous object and Vision as the reception of this activity. In addition to simple sensory input, memory's role in visual perception is described.","Florence, 1492: The Reappearance of Plotinus|Saffrey, H.D.|<i>Renaissance Quarterly<i>, 1996, Vol 49, No 3, pp 488-508.||The Partial Eclipse of Plotinus in the Middle Ages and his Recovery in the Renaissance|Corrigan, K.|<i>Patristica et Mediaevalia<i>, Vol 40, No 2, pp 25-43.||The Bookseller of Florence: The Story of the Manuscripts That Illuminated the Renaissance|King, R.|Atlantic Monthly, 2021, 496 pp.||Plotinus: An Introduction to the Enneads|O'Meara, D.j.|Clarendon Press,1993, 154 pp, NB: pp 1-12, 111-119.||Une bibliographie analytique des √©ditions, traductions et commentaires de la Vie de Plotin, 1492-1980|O'Brien, D.|In: Porphyre: La Vie de Plotin.

The later is particularly the case regarding the senses, including vision. Alexander's commentaries were  vastly influential, affecting later philosophers beginning in late antiquity through late medieval times, including and especially Plotinus and his theory of vision as well as several Arabic scholars. The Scholastic teaching on vision formed by Alexander's commentary on Aristotle's De Anima, was in continual opposition to Perspectiva after it arose, first appeared in print in the present edition, and finally ended with the publication of Fortunio Liceti's <i>De Luminis Natura<i> of 1640.||Girolamo Donato produced this, the first Latin translation of De Anima in 1495. Angelo Canini produced another Latin translation in 1546. As Donato points out in his Preface, Alexander's Greek text had long been influential and earned him the name 'The Commentator.' Donato's Latin made Alexander's assessment of and extension to Aristotle's teaching on the senses and the intellect available to a wide late medieval and early Renaissance readership.
","Alexander of Aphrodisias describes and advances Aristotle's theory of light and vision which, as stated by  Alexander, has its basis in the proposition that 'The proper sensible object of sight is colors.' Media between the eye and an object of color has the potential to be transparent. The eye gains access to colors when the intervening medium has that potentiality actualized. That is, the medium's potential transparency is made actual. The medium must be illuminated by light for this to take place. Alexander considers that colors and light set potentially transparent media in motion, bringing about the actualization of transparency, and as a result, color moves and tinctures light itself. He cites the example of a wall taking on the color of an opposing wall that is deeply pigmented. Alexander explicitly denies an 'efflux' or emission of any type; motion is transferred but there is nothing emitted. In this Alexander explicitly opposed the theory of the Atomists, who consider vision to take place when 'eidola' (spirit-images, idols)  were emitted by an object and entered the eye.||Alexander set out the full process of vision this way: A transparent substance is illuminated and becomes actually transparent and is acted upon by color, setting the transparent substance in motion which, in turn, acts upon the sense of sight. Light, therefore, takes on color from different visible objects, and is directed by these objects in a straight line to the organ of vision and transmits to the eye the very same affection which it received from the colored objects. Importantly 'Light' for Alexander (and for Aristotle) is not an emitted substance, rather it is 'the activity of what is transparent.' Stated in terms of Aristotle's four causes, light is the efficient cause, color the formal cause, the medium the material cause, and vision the final cause. The idea that color-motion moves in straight lines from object to eye is the first application of geometrical optics to Aristotelian vision theory and would later prompt medieval extensions involving vision by reflection and refraction. Additionally, Alexander's extension of the idea of color-motion allows him to account for other aspects of visual perception including motion, position, and shape by making a distinction between color appearance and perception.","‚ÅÇ <i>Alexander of Aphrodisias and his Doctrine of the Soul: 1400 Years of Lasting Significance<i>|Ke√üler, E.|Brill, Leiden, 2011, 101 pp, NB: pp 24-42.||<i>The History of Vision, Colour, & Light Theories<i>|Zempl√©n, G. √Å.|Bern <i>Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science<i>, 2005||‚ÅÇùëª Fotinis, A.F.|<i>The De Anima of Alexander of Aphrodisias: A Translation and Commentary<i>|Thesis, Marquette University, 1978.||Alexander of Aphrodisias on Vision in the Atomists|Avotins, I.|<i>The Classical Quarterly<i>, New Series, Vol 30, No 2, 1980, pp 429-454.||The Prefaces to the Greek Editions and Latin Translations of Alexander of Aphrodisias, 1450 to 1575|Cranz, F.E.|<i>Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society<i>, Vol 102, No 5, 1958, pp 510-546.",Alexandri aphrodisi enarratio de anima ex aristotelis institutione.

"Giovanni da San Gimignano, OP","da San Gimignano, Giovanni OP",Joannes de Sancto Geminiano,c1260-1340," ","Liber de Exemplis ","Late 13th century Tuscan encyclopedic preaching handbook with allegories, examples, and similes from the natural world, including the human body and vision. Circulated widely in Central Europe and used until the late 17th century.","Giovanni da San Gimignano wrote the <i>Liber de Exemplis<i> between 1298 and 1314. It is a Tuscan encyclopedic preaching handbook with allegories, examples, and similes from the natural world, including the human body and vision. In his Prologue, da San Gimignano makes clear his intent: to give a large collection of examples for use in sermons. His sources for cited text excerpts are the Bible and sacred writers (Augustine, Gerolamo, Gregory, Isidoro, Bede, and Bernardo) but also profane authors (Cicero, Seneca, Pliny, Aristotle, Plato, Avicenna, Hippocrates, Galen, Constantine the African, Solino, and Ptolemy). Interestingly, he excludes stories, tales, and legends and uses only what he calls 'natural' examples. The long appeal of the <i>Liber<i> rested on this reliance on sophisticated examples and citations from the natural world. In addition, the structure of the <i>Liber de Exemplis<i> is designed to function as a memory device for preachers and gives a method for training and facilitating memory. Importantly, and unlike the De Oculo Morali of Peter of Limoges, the <i>Liber de Exemplis<i> shows no influence or knowledge of the <i>De Aspectibus<i> of Alhazen. Both these exempla for preachers were written just as the De Aspectibus was becoming widely known and studied.||The <i>Liber de Exemplis<i> was widely used; there are still 56 manuscript copies extant. It was first printed in 1477 and again in 1499. An edited version appeared a Lyon in 1585. Circulated widely in Central Europe and used until the late 17th century.
","The <i>Liber de Exemplis<i> is in 10 books. Books 1-5 are the order of creation and books 6-10 are man, his body, senses, soul, and society. Within each books the material is in alphabetical order and separate directories to the 'Realia' and 'Moralia.' Every natural example has properties, each of which has an explanation and a moral allegory, each of which, in turn, is accompanied by a biblical, patristic, or profane text excerpt. The books are as follows  1: The heavens and the elements (88 leaves). This includes natural elements and celestial bodies, all of which are related moral states or principles; fire  to goodness or abstinence; stars to the Church Doctors; Moon to the active life. 2: On metals and gems (22 leaves) 3: On Vegetables and Plants (46 leaves). 4: Fish and birds (28 leaves). 5: Animals of the Earth (34 Leaves). Numerous elaborate relationships are drawn between animals and man, including sources of food, their strength for work, remedies for health, and moral lessons. 6: Man and his parts (57 leaves) begins with a consideration of Greek doctrines and the Aristotelian binding of soul and body. From this comes examples of internal and external man, physical and spiritual life, codes of conduct. 7: Visions and Dreams (35 leaves) gives the ancient rules developed for their interpretation. 8: Law and judicial activity (25 leaves) 9: Crafts and Manufactured things. (33 leaves) This includes different agricultural techniques, processing metals, arts of writing and book production, and construction of musical instruments. 10: Actions and Behavior of Man (17 leaves)||The first 6 books borrow heavily from the  <i>De Proprietatibus Rerum<i> of Bartholomaeus Anglicus, including the material on vision. The eye and vision are considered in book 6, chapters 16 and 22 and present  visual pyramids with apex at the eye and based at the viewed object. These conduct object species into the eye, facilitated by light and the luminous fire from the eye. This is essentially the description found in the De proprietatibus Rerum of Bartholomaeus Anglicus. The <i>Liber de Exemplis<i> also mentions 'ocularia de vitro'--one of the earliest references to spectacles.","Giovanni da San Gimignano|At: Treccani Institute|Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-da-san-gimignano_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/||Medical Similes in Religious Discourse: The Case of Giovanni di San Gimignano OP (ca. 1260‚Äìca. 1333)|Zieglar, J.|<i>Science in Context<i>, Vol 8, No 1, 1995 , pp 103-131.",Liber de Exemplis et Similtudinibus Rerum,Book of Examples and Similes,,1499,1475-1500,"Dominican from Siena, wrote imporant aids, outlines, and encyclopedias for preachers.

"John Pecham, OFM","Pecham, John OFM",John Pecham,c1230-1292,"Edited by Luca Gaurico (1475-1558)  Italian astrologer, astronomer, mathematician",Perspectiva Communis,"Most widely used elementary textbook on optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics in Europe from the 13th to the 17th centuries.

","John Peckham wrote this widely used elementary textbook on optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics sometime between 1265 and 1279; before he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Peckham's chief source was <i>De Aspectibus<i>, a 13th century Latin translation of KitƒÅb al-ManƒÅ·∫ìir, 'The Book of Optics,' written at the Fatimid capital of Cairo between 1010-1020 by Ab≈´  øAl·øë al-·∏§asan ibn al-·∏§asan ibn al-Haytham, the greatest physicist of the Islamic Golden Age. Peckham refers to  <i>De Aspectibus<i> and its author with an indirectness that makes clear Peckham assumed his reader would know both well. This aspect of Peckham's book makes clear how influential the <i>De Aspectibus<i> was by the end of the 13th century. Peckham follows the order, content, and material of the De Aspectibus. Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon also influenced Peckham's optics, but to a considerably less degree; Grosseteste did not know the <i>De Aspectibus<i>, and Bacon tinctured it deeply with Neoplatonic optics. Peckham can be considered the earliest of writers to break away from Neoplatonic optics and fully embrace a physical, rather than a metaphysical basis for light and vision. Following  Alhacen's <i>De Aspectibus<i> rather than Grosseteste and Bacon||From his introduction, it  clear that Peckham thought his book  would serve as an introduction to Alhacen's much longer, more detailed, and abstruse work: 'I shall compress into concise summaries the teachings of perspective, which are often presented with great obscurity . . .' Although Peckham either summarizes or omits most of the elaborate geometry in the <i>De Aspectibus<i> and its tedious details, nothing of the basic principles or central ideas are missing. It is this character of the <i>Perspectiva Communis<i>--at once complete, summative, and accessible--that made it so popular. It was used throughout Europe as a textbook from the 13th to the 17th centuries and was the basis for lectures, commentaries, and paraphrases, and is cited in most optics books in 16th and 17th centuries.||This Venice edition of 1504 is particular interesting and important. It was edited by the famed astrologer Luca Gaurico, with figures not only more numerous than those of the editio princeps of 1482, but considerably augmented with printed labeling and guides. Clearly the book was prepared to use as a textbook. This copy has the final leaf containing errata and the epigram to the editor by Donatus Zerbus. The edition at Valencia in 1503 and Leipzig in 1504 also have labeled figures, but they have numerous printing errors but without errata. The woodblock image on the title page of the Venice edition of 1504 had been used by Sessa in his 1502 printing of Liber Secretorum, attributed to Albertus Magnus. A counterfeit of this edition without name or date appeared in Italy sometime after 1504, complete with a slightly altered version of the title page image. ||At least 70 manuscript copies of the <i>Perspectiva Communis<i> are still extant. It was first printed at Milan in 1482/3 and then at Valencia in 1503, Venice and Leipzig in 1504, Paris in 1510, Nuremburg in 1542, Paris in 1556, Cologne in 1580 and 1592, Venice in 1593, and Cologne in 1627. This last printing being more than 20 years after Kepler's optics work. Importantly, beginning with the edition of 1542 edited by Georg Hartmann at Cologne, the printed texts begin to be updated and modernized, and departs significantly from the manuscript tradition that informed the early printings. By 1580 the printing only resembled the manuscripts in content. Even with its changes, Peckham's <i>Perspectiva Communis<i> is an accurate mirror of general optical knowledge from the advent of Ahazen's <i>De Aspectibus<i> late in the 13th century to the appearance of Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> in 1604.
","Peckham's <i>Perspectiva Communis<i> has a structure that follows the <i>De Aspectibus<i> of Alhazen and is in three parts: Vision by direct rays, Vision by reflected rays, Vision by refracted rays. Part 1, Vision by direct rays includes the properties and propagation of light and color, anatomy and function of the eye, physical requirements for vision, psychology of vision, visual errors. Unlike most of the rest of the work, this section adopts the medieval theory of species to describe direct light propagation and direct vision and does not invoke geometric images. Peckham's book gives one of the first depictions of the optic chiasm in print.  Part 2, Vision by reflected rays includes the law and properties of reflection, images by reflection, visual errors, burning mirrors and twinkling stars. Part 3, Vision by refracted rays includes rays through transparent media, image formation and visual errors from refracted rays, refraction within the eye, the burning glass and kindling rays, the rainbow and Milky Way. While Peckham generally presents and describes Alhazen's intromission theory of vision--in which rays from a luminous object fall on the glacial humor (the lens) of the eye in a manner that preserves a map of the object--he occasionally adopts Euclid's theory of vision rays emitted from the eye, particularly for highly geometrical optics. Peckham is particularly selective and qualitative about refraction, presenting no general law or data.","‚ÅÇùëª <i>John Pecham and the Science of Optics: Perspectiva Communis<i>|Lingberg, D.

Themon Judaeus,Themon Judaeus,,fl1349-1361," ",Questiones Super Quatuor Libros Metheorerum Aristotelis,"A consideration of the optical issues raised in Aristotle's <i>De Meteorologica<i>: vision theory, the rainbow, and halos.

","Themon Judaeus wrote his Questions on Aristotle's Meteorology while at the University of Paris around 1350. This is part of the scholastic <i>Questiones<i> literature on Aristotle's physical treatises, and in Themon Judaeus's case considers the <i>De Meteorologica<i>. The disputation of questions by the elaborate mechanisms of logic had been a prominent scholastic teaching method since the 12th century. The printing of the 14th century text of Themon Judaeus gives evidence of the continuing humanistic interest in this form of scholastic teaching--but it also marks the beginning of its decline and eventual abandonment.||As an intellectual and teaching exercise, Themon lists questions that scholastic teaching considered to be implied by Aristotle's writing but left unaddressed and, remaining unsettled, demanded study and consideration. Most of the 65 questions are presented with pros and cons. Some of Themon's questions related to optics, vision theory, the rainbow, and halos, among others. ||<i>Questiones Super Quatuor Libros Metheororum<i> (Questions on the Four Books of Meteorology of Aristotle) of Themon Judaeus was widely popular and studied until the 17th century. It was first printed at Pavia in 1480, in an edition of Aristotle's <i>De Meterologica<i> accompanied by commentary and Themon's questions appeared at Venice in 1496, 1507, 1515, and 1522, and in a complete course of physics at Paris in 1516, 1517, and 1518.
","Themon considers 19 questions in book 1 of <i>De Meteorologica<i>, 11 in book 2, 27 in book 3, and 8 in book 4. Questions 8 in book 1, 1-7 and 10-18 in book 2 deal with optical matters and the rainbow. Some of the issues raised by Themon are considered by Aristotle in the <i>De Meteorologica<i>, several are not. Themon asks and answers questions regarding the basic aspects of reflection and refraction and whether just color is reflected in mirrors but not shape and figure--just color according to Aristotle, but this certainly in not supported by simple geometric optics. Themon considers atmospheric halos, mock suns, and the rainbow. It is asked whether the rainbow is produced by reflection, refraction or both. Aristotle considered it a purely reflective phenomena; Themon plumps for both.","‚ÅÇ Questions on the Four Books of Aristotle's Meterologica|Grant, E., translator|In: <i>A Source Book in Medieval Science<i>|Grand, E., editor|Harvard University Press, 1974, 864 pp, NB: pp 207-211.||Medieval and Renaissance scholastic conceptions of the influence of the celestial region on the terrestial|Grant, E.|<i>Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies<i>, Vol 17, No 1, 1987, pp 1-23.||The threefold object of the scientific knowledge.

No mention is made of other theories. The material on light and vision is in the first tract in Book Eight. The material on the generation of color is in the second tract.

A consideration of many professions and sciences.","Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim's consideration of human nature and knowledge, their rupture from the divine, and their subsequent corruption. Agrippa's declamatory invective considered trades, professions, leisure, and persons--nothing and no one was spared. Though deeply interested in science, he thought ‚Äúthere is nothing more fatal than a science stuffed with impiety‚Äù and so it is not faulty epistemology he inveighs against, rather it is human frailty, vanity, pretentions, and credulity. He does not oppose science, he opposes scholastic teaching, worldly preoccupation, and sources of unbelief. <i>De incertitude<i> was widely read and tremendously influential.||The book was condemned by Margaret of Austria, Governess of the Habsburg Netherlands, and the faculties at the Sorbonne and Louvain; to which Agrippa would write vigorous rebuttals.||First printed at Antwerp in 1530, at Cologne in 1531, 1532, 1536, 1537, 1568, 1582, 1584, at Paris in 1533, at Antwerp 1534, at London in 1575, at Lyon in 1624, 1630, 1643, at the Hague in 1653, 1662, Frankfurt and Leipzig in 1693, 1714. It was also printed several times without the place or printer being identified, 1539, 1544, 1550, 1556, 1564, 1609, and 1622. It was translated into German in 1534, Italian in 1543, English in 1569, Dutch in 1651, and French in 1582.
","The most important aspect of Agrippa's <i>De Incertitudine & Vanitate Scientiarum<i> is its denial of the power of reason, and by extension, the sciences. He considered scientific result so weak and uncertain that it was better not to know things. The motto on the title page is <i>Nihil scire felicissima vita<i>, 'The Happiest Life is that of the Ignorant.' This included the occult sciences. The <i>De Incertitudine & Vanitate Scientiarum<i> is more famous for the acerbic attack it mounts on a long list of targets: the learned, artists and poets, physicians, clerics, courtly life, along with many professions and sciences--102 chapters in all. In natural philosophy and professions he considers arithmetic, geomancy, geometry, optics and perspective, painting, sculpture, architecture, metallurgy, astronomy, astrology, magic in various forms, agriculture, military arts, anatomy, the law and lawyers, and theologians. Astrology and magic are particular targets. The material on optics and perspective is in chapter 23. It briefly reiterates the nature of direct, reflected and refracted vision. To exemplify the uncertainty in this science, he cites nine sources and their varying theories of light, ranging from the Greeks and Aristotle, through the Arabs and Al-Kindi, to St. Augustine. Illusions, false images, uncertainty of distance, size, and motion are presented as cautions regarding vision and how it can mislead the intellect.","De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum|In: <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy<i>, Stanford University, 2016|http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/agrippa-nettesheim/||<i>Magic and Technology in Early Modern Europe<i>|Grafton, A.|Dibner Library Lecture 2002|Smithsonian Institution Libraries, 2005, 52 pp, NB: pp 31-35.||Agrippa and the Crisis of Renaissance Thought|Nauert, C.G.

Gaius Secundus Pliny,"Pliny, Gaius Secundus",,23-79,"Edited by Sigismund Gelenius (1497-1554), famed Czech humanist and Greek scholar. ",Naturalis Historia,Pliny's uncritical assembly of information gathered from many sources and forming an encyclopedia of all knowledge of the ancient world.,"This is the second edition of Pliny from the press of Hieronymus Froben. It was contemporaneous with the Aldine edition of Pliny of 1535-1538. It contains numerous fine woodcut initials in the text, including large historiated ones measuring up to 40 x 40 mm, designed by Hans Holbein the Younger, and presenting classical, mythological and Biblical characters, such as Socrates, Diogenes and Alexander, Heracles and Antaeus, Gaius Julius Caesar, Job, and Balaam. Text printed in single columns, in an elegant, relatively large roman type; Gelenius' commentary is printed in single columns in a smaller roman type, indexes printed in quadruple columns in small italic type.||Pliny's monumental work is divided into 37 books covering all aspects of ancient knowledge. He explicitly and scrupulously cites over 2,000 sources and though often showing great and varied erudition, Pliny is credulous regarding some of them. In either case, from these sources he extracted some 20,000 facts, placed them into categories, and wrote explanatory text. Generally, Pliny is interested in practical phenomena and useful data, not the understanding of causes or the pursuit of knowledge. That is, he is a compiler and not an investigator. And there was no unifying principle or theory for Pliny: Nature was the sum of its parts, and he attempted to locate and describe all those parts. There is a lightly-imposed structure to the work: It begins with the heavens, then moves to the Earth and geography, to animals (beginning with humans), sea creatures, and insects. Then to plants and medicines derived from them (a large portion of the work is medical). And finally to metals and minerals. With its extensive tables and indexes, the <i>Historia Naturalis<i> fulfilled Pliny's ambition to create a universal reference book, and continued to be the object of study and considerable authority. Pliny's text was influential in Rome's empire, and beyond its end into Medieval times and the Renaissance. The complete text was copied and extracted, for example, by Isidore of Seville for his  Etymologiae. Even as the veracity of its facts and reliability of its sources dimmed, Pliny's text continued to be read for pleasure and for knowledge of the ancient world. Unlike many other ancient authors who were lost and rediscovered, knowledge of Pliny's text has existed continuously in the two millennia since his time.||The commentary by Sigismundus Gelenius first appeared in this edition and covers the entire text of the <i>Historia<i>. It begins with a dedicatory epistle in which Gelenius' keenness for the authority of manuscripts is apparent. Gelenius' commentary became the most authoritative, and a standard part of editions of Pliny in the remainder of the 16th and much of the 17th century. He revised it in 1545 and again in 1553. It appeared in 28 editions of Pliny's text between 1535 and 1669 issued from Basel, Paris, Lyons, Venice, Frankfurt, and Geneva.

","Preliminaries begin with Hieronymus Froben's short address to the reader, then Erasmus of Rotterdam's dedicatory epistle to Stanislav I Thurzo, bishop of Olomouc, dated 1525. Book I of the <i>Historia<i> is a table of contents for the subsequent 36 books. They are followed the annotations of Sigismund Gelenius (1497-1554), famed Czech humanist and Greek scholar. Gelenius' annotations are prefaced with his dedication to Dami√£o de G√≥is, Portuguese humanist philosopher and historian. This is followed by a general index and finally a geographic index.||Pliny's 37 books have content as follows. Book I: Preface and tables of contents, lists of authorities; Book II: mathematical and physical description of the world, Astronomy and meteorology; Books III-VI: geography and ethnography; Book VII: anthropology and human physiology; Books VIII-XI: zoology: land animals, marine animals and fish, birds, and insects.; Books XII-XXVII: botany, including agriculture, farming, gardening and horticulture with much material on wine & viticulture; Books XXVIII-XXXII: medicine, pharmacology, medicinal use of plants & animals. Including chapters on occult arts and magic in Book XXX; Books XXXIII-XXXVII: mineralogy, metals, gemstones, glass. The emphasis is on applications in arts and crafts, including chasing in silver, statuary in bronze, painting and making paints and pigments, and sculpture in marble.  Books XII-XXVII contain botany material related to medicine and pharmacology, and include large portions of the writings of two of the ancient herbalists, Diocles and Crataeus, which would otherwise not have survived.||The optics material in Pliny's text is brief, but described reflection, refraction, colors, magnification, and some aspects of vision. The material on reflection is borrowed from Lucretius' <i>De Rerum Natura<i> and describes the appearance of images in plane and curved mirrors. Pliny also mentions multiple and distorted images from facetted mirrors. Refraction is described in water and crystals and particular mention is made of 'rainbow stones'--prismatic colors produced by quartz and crystal. Magnification is mentioned in regard to the properties of certain gemstones. The concentration of light that produces burning by vessels filled with water is also described. In the material on geography, Pliny describes how direct line-of-sight and the curvature of the Earth are responsible for the appearance and disappearance of ships  at the horizon.","<i>Pliny the Elder on Science and Technology<i>|Healy, J.F.|Oxford, 1999, 488 pp, NB: pp 142-152.||Pliny's Historia naturalis.

Petrus Apianus [Peter Benewitz] (1501-1552)  German humanist, mathematician, astronomer and cartographer, student of Tannstetter.",Peri optikeÃÑs,"Tannstetter's editing of Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i>, his widely used redaction of <i>De Aspectibus<i>, the 13th century Latin translation of ùë≤ùíäùíïùíÇÃÑùíÉ ùíÇùíç-ùë¥ùíÇùíèùíÇÃÑùíõÃ£ùíäùíì‚Äé,the Arabic original of Ibn al-Haytham. Prefaced by a significant exposition of necessary mathematics.
","This, the first printing of <i>Perspectiva<i> by the Thuringian scholar Witelo, has it roots in the manuscript tradition. Written in about 1275 while Witelo was at the Papal court at Viterbo, it is a redaction and augmenting of Alhazen's De Aspectibus which had begun to circulate in the Latin West early in the 13th century. It, in turn, was a Latin translation of KitƒÅb al-ManƒÅ·∫ìir‚Äé, the Arabic original of Ab≈´  øAlƒ´ al-·∏§asan ibn al-·∏§asan ibn al-Haytham of around 1050. While John Peckham's Perspectiva Communis was medieval Europe's most used basic optics text, Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i> was the advanced, comprehensive equivalent; more than 25 manuscripts are still extant. There were several reasons for its utility.  First, though following Alhazen closely, Witelo imposed a Euclid-like structure of theorems or propositions, including enunciations, definitions, and proofs. This made the text more accessible and didactic; significantly more useful as a textbook than Alhazen's <i>De Aspectibus<i>. Second, Witelo's Perspectiva included a long first book that introduced all the plane and three-dimensional geometry that would be required to study the subsequent text. Though it contained no original mathematics, it brought the necessary geometry to bear directly on optics. Third, Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i> included topics not covered in the De Aspectibus, including mirror foci, refraction by glass spheres, and atmospheric refraction.||By the end of 15th century perspectival optics was in the curriculum at the universities of Paris, Vienna, Prague, Leipzig, Krakow, Oxford, Cambridge, and others, and Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i> among the principal optics texts in use. In 1472 Johannes M√ºller von K√∂nigsberg, better known as Regiomontanus, published at Nuremburg a prospectus of manuscripts he intended to edit and have printed; number 12 on the list was 'Perspectiva Vitelonis.' But a printed edition did not appear until 1535 when Georg Tannstetter and his astronomer-pupil Peter Apian edited the text for the Nuremburg press of Johannes Petreius. The intention was to produce a book that could be used at the University of Vienna where Tannstetter taught. It would be from the Perspectiva of Witelo that Renaissance Europe learned optics and the source for many optical texts that would appear subsequently. Including Johannes Kepler, prompting him to publish his <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> in 1604. Tannstetter and Apian's edition appeared in 1535, was reprinted in 1551, and would remain Europe's comprehensive optical textbook until Risner's edition of 1572.
","Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i> is in 10 books. 1: Geometry. 2: Light, light rays, and shadows. 3: Structure and function of the eye. 4: Seeing and perception. 5: Reflection at plane surfaces. 6: Reflection at curved surfaces. 7: Reflection at conical surfaces. 8: Reflection at spherical surfaces. 9: Burning mirrors, their foci and construction. 10: Refraction, the rainbow, and other meteorics. Aside from the important Euclidian structure imposed on the De Aspectibus, Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i> contains most of Alhazen's material and does not differ in any fundamental way on most optical issues: Theory of vision, nature and propagation of light, the empirical method, apparatus, and experiments, and geometric analysis--all are in the <i>Perspectiva<i>  as they are in the <i>De Ascpectibus<i>. In this sense, Witelo has been called Alhazen's commentator or more derogatorily, as Maurolyco had it, his ape. But in some ways, <i>Perspectiva<i> is importantly different from <i>De Aspectibus<i>. The first book devoted to geometry is important and unique to the <i>Perspectiva<i>. Like Alhazen, Witelo cites Ptolemy on angles of refraction, repeating the values from the <i>Optica<i>. But unlike Alhazen, Witelo attempts and analysis and extension and gets tangled in errors. Witelo's extensive treatment of the parabolic burning mirror and his treatment of the rainbow is not found in the <i>De Aspectibus<i>.","<i>Opticae Thesaurus<i>|Introduction to this reprint edition by Lindberg, D.|Johnson Reprint Corporation, 1972, pp v-xxxiv.||Peter Apian als Herausgeber der 'Perspectiva communis' von Witelo|K√ºhne, A.|In: <i>Peter Apian, Astronomie, Kosmographie und Mathematik am Beginn der Neuzeit<i>, Karl R√∂ttel , editor|Polygon-Verlag Buxheim-Eichst√§tt, 1995, pp 233-239.||<i>Geometry and Space: The Celebrated Collection of Books on Geometry, Optics, and Perspective of M.

Euclid,Euclid,Euclid of Alexandria,c295 BC," ",Elementorum Geometricorum Lib XV,"First appearance of all of Euclid's geometrical optics.","The first complete assemblage of the Euclidean texts, with printings of both Campanus of Navara's and Bartolomeo Zamberti's versions of the Elements. This edition begins with a Preface by Philipp Melanchthon, which censorship had often removed. The Campanus of Navara version of Books I-XV of the Elements was common in the late Middle Ages and Ratdolt used it in his editio princeps of 1482. In addition is the version of Bartolomeo Zamberti which he had based on a Greek text and so, he claimed, rendered a more accurate and faithful Euclid. Latin translations of Euclid's Optica and Catoptrica were first printed in Georgius Valla's massive compendium <i>De Expetendis et Fugiendis Rebus Opus<i> printed by Aldus at Venice in 1501, but this is the first edition of Euclid's collected works to contain them both. The <i>Optica<i> is a Latin translation of the first Greek work on vision and perspective--the earliest surviving text on optics and light in the western world. The <i>Optica<i> presents the phenomena of visible light and the Euclidian idea of vision rays emanating from the eye, comfortably aligned with and analyzed by geometry. It re-emerged as an important text in the 15h century for it use in the theory of linear perspective. The <i>Catoptrica<i>, a treatise on mirrors attributed by Proclus to Euclid, covers the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed by plane and spherical concave mirrors.
","This edition contains the Elements, Phaenomena, Optica, Catoptrica, Data, and the Opusculum de Levi & Ponderoso. The last work is of questionable authorship but Arabic sources attest to a Euclidian work on moving bodies. The Optica begins with 7 postulates which together detail the nature of the visual cone, with its apex at the center of the eye, its circular base out at the limit of vision, and its interior filled with straight rays, spaced equally within. vision takes place when rays fall on an object. From this basis, the subsequent 58 propositions define vision and aspects of visual perception including apparent size, acuity, motion, shape, judgements of distance--all based on the visual angle subtended by the viewed object. Each proposition is based on or proved with geometry. Some of the propositions arise from geometric astronomy, some deal with the practical matters of surveying and mensuration. All this can be considered a geometricization of the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by rays that emanate from the eye.||The Catoptrica begins with six postulates that establish vision as the result of straight vision rays, even when their course is altered by reflection. They also set down the equal-angle law of specular reflection, and the so-called cathetus rule regarding reflected object position and visibility in plane and spherical mirrors. The cathetus being the line passing through the object and perpendicular to the reflecting surface. The rule was held to be universally true until the end of 16th century. Thirty six propositions follow the postulates, established images positions in mirrors of various forms. The latter propositions establish image position using the cathetus rule, attempting to explain image anomalies (size, magnification, position) in curved mirrors. Like the Optica, the Catoptrica is entirely geometric; there is nothing physical or physiological in the material, aside from the fundamental assumption of rectilinear vision rays emitted from the eye, the propagation, direction, and interaction of which can be described entirely by geometry.","ùëª The Optics of Euclid|Burton, H.E., translator|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i>, Vol 46, No 5, 1945, pp 357-372.||ùëª <i>The medieval Latin traditions of Euclid's Catoptrica: A Critical Edition of De speculis with an Introduction, English Translation, and Commentary<i>|Takahashi, K.|Kyushu University Press, 1992, 373 pp.||<i>Campanus of Novara and Euclid's Elements<i>|Busard, H.L.L.|Franz Steiner Verlag, 2005, 535 pp, NB pp 1-46.||<i>From Sight to Light<i>|Smith, A.M.|University of Chicago Press, 2015, 457 pp, NB: pp 47-64.||Pseudo-Euclidean reflections in ancient optics: a re-examination of textual issues pertaining to the the Euclidean Optica and Catoptrica|Knorr, W.|<i>Physis<i>, Vol 31, No 1, 1994, pp 1-45.||Peripatetic and Euclidean theories of the visual ray|Jones, A.|<i>Physis<i>, Vol 31, No 1, 1994, pp 47-76.",Euclid Elementorum Geometricorum Lib XV,The Fifteen Books of Euclid's Elements of Geometry,,1537,1525-1550,"Ancient author of geometry, taught at Athens and Alexandria.",9,1482,,,Basel,Johann Herwagen,,,,‚Ä†‚Å¥ a-z‚Å∂ A-Z‚Å∂ Aa-Cc‚Å∂," [ùü†] 1-587 [ùüô]",,"Marginalia , calculations, and notes throughout",Contemporary 1/2 Calf Over Speckled Boards Rebacked,2,295,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1537 Euclid - Elementorum Geometricorum Lib XV - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/about/Euclidis_Megarensis_mathematici_clarissi.html?id=caGBGN29IIQC,17,Binoche et Giquello,47.5649,7.6153

This text is used in all subsequent editions, editions, and translations.
","Georg Hartmann's editing of Peckham's optics textbook was something of a second-hand project. He had first intended to edit and publish and edition of Ptolemy's optics. Hartmann knew that Johannes M√ºller von K√∂nigsberg, better known as Regiomontanus, had intended edit and publish an edition of Ptolemy's optics. In 1472 Regiomontanus published at Nuremburg a prospectus of manuscripts he intended to edit and have printed; number 13 on the list was 'Perspectiva Ptolemei.' But Regiomontanus died before the project was undertaken. Hartmann had access to some of Regiomontanus papers and manuscripts but was forced to abandon the project for lack of an adequate manuscript. As he mentions in his forward, Harmann worked on the Peckham text instead, intending to improve and update the text with changes and additions, particularly to ocular anatomy. Hartmann also inserts citations of Witelo's Perspectiva which are entirely spurious. This edition marks a significant change in the tradition of printed editions of the <i>Perspectiva Communis<i>, as Hartmann's text was used in all subsequent editions, editings, and translations. Though the principal ideas of Peckham are present, the text is altered considerably. These alterations include typographic and sentence structure--inserting diphthongs and moving verbs to the end of sentences, for example--to comply with the humanistic sensibilities of the times.

Commentators of late antiquity, Philoponus in particular, began to break with Aristotelian teaching; expanding, explaining and in some cases completely recasting Aristotle's ideas. With Philoponus begins the rejection of Aristotelian natural philosophy. This was particular true with Philoponus and especially so regarding the nature of light and vision. Philoponus argued against the Aristotelian idea that light actualized the potential transparency of media, proposing instead that is was emitted by a luminous object. This was the late antiquarian beginnings of the medieval idea of species emitted by luminous objects that entered the eye. Soon after his death, Philoponus' break with Aristotle and his theological views were judged to be too radical if not heretical, and so his commentaries had little initial effect in the Latin West, though they would be an important influence on the Arabic scholar Al-Kindi and the formulation of his theory of vision. Most of Philoponus' commentaries were unknown in medieval times, not having been translated into Latin. Only a section of book three of <i>De Anima<i> had been translated from the Greek by William of Moerbeke in the 13th century. But interest in Philoponus' thought, his recasting of Aristotle's ideas, and an interest in a non-Aristotelian natural philosophy awoke in the early Renaissance and created a demand for his works. His commentary on <i>De Anima<i> was first printed in Greek and in Latin at Venice in 1535. Latin editions appeared at Lyon in 1544 and 1558, and at Venice in 1544, 1547, 1551, 1554, 1560, and 1581.
","Philoponus' commentary and reassessment of Aristotle's theory of light and vision is in book two of <i>De Anima<i>. It was an attempt in late antiquity to reconcile Aristotelian teaching on light and vision with then contemporary knowledge of optics, principally geometric optics. The reconciliation begins with assessing Aristotelian shortcomings and modifying Aristotelian ideas. Philoponus' principle objections to Aristotle's theory of light and vision were that it could not account for or be aligned with the readily observed facts of geometric optics, it could not account for the generation of images in mirrors, nor could it account for the thermal effects produced by burning mirrors.  Philoponus effected a significant reinterpretation of Aristotelian theory of light and vision, changing Aristotle's notion of <i>energia<i> from something that changed transparency from potential to actual, to something that moved from object to the eye within a medium that allowed such motion. Philoponus changed Aristotle's light from an incorporeal quality to an entity emitted from sources, with vision resulting from its intromission to the eye.","Philoponus' Interpretation of Aristotle's Theory of Light|Sambursky, S.|<i>Osiris<i>, Vol 13, 1958, pp 114-126||ùëª <i>Aristotle and Philopnous on Light<i>|De Groot, J.|Routledge, 2016, 137 pp, NB: pp 102-123.||<i>Philoponus and the Rejection of Aristotelian Science<i>|Sorabji, R., editor|Cornell University Press, 1987, NB: pp 66-70, Chapter 12.||Optics and Natural Philosophy in Late Antiquity|Berryman, S.|<i>Apeiron<i>, Vol 45, 2012, pp 201‚Äì220.","Ioannis Alexandrei Philosophi in Tres Libros de Anima Aristotelis Breves Annotationes, ex Dissertationibus Ammonii Hemei, cum Quibusdam Propriis Meditationibus.

Simone Porzio,"Porzio, Simone",Attributed to Aristotle,1496-1554," ",De coloribus libellus,"Translation and commentary on the pseudo-Aristotelian <i>De Coloribus<i>, a theoretical discussion of light and color.
","Simone Porzio's Translation and commentary on the Aristotelian work on color, generally attributed to Aristotle's follower Theophrastus. Aristotle's thinking on color is scattered throughout his works but set out most clearly (and collectedly) in his <i>De Sensu et Sensibili<i> and in <i>De Coloribus<i>. Porzio had been teaching at Naples but in 1545 had moved to Pisa, accepting a very substantial offer to teach and assume the chair of natural philosophy. At this time his interests, teaching, and scholarly work turned away from theology and ecclesiastical questions, to physics and medicine. He took up the principal physics and medical texts of Aristotle and their peripatetic tradition. It is known that he read, commented on, and taught from <i>De Celo<i>, <i>De Sensu<i>, <i>De Coloribus<i>, and <i>De Physica<i>, and used commentaries of Galen and late antiquity on these texts. It was at Pisa that he produced this rendering of and commentary on the <i>De Coloribus<i>, giving an analysis and discussion of light and color. Like his other texts, it was quickly printed and in use in several Italian universities, becoming the principal peripatetic text on color in the Renaissance. Editions appeared at Florence in 1548 and at Paris in 1549. 
","Prozio presented Aristotle's theory of color in six chapters. 1: The nature of color. 2: Simple colors. 3: 'Middle' or mixed colors. 4: 'Infinite' colors. 5: Mutation of color by mixing. 6: Colors of hair, feathers, and skin. The introduction gives the color theories of the Pythagoreans, Plato, and Aristotle. He also gives an analysis of Greek color terms and their Latin equivalent. Prozio presents the principal aspects of Aristotelian color theory: color was a property of an object's surface; color was transmitted to eye by filling an actualized transparent medium--and therefore was not a perception; color was the  result of mixing whiteness and blackness in various proportions. On these three aspects he provides considerable commentary. Prozio graded and arranged colors according to their 'shine'--what would now be called their luminance. Yellow was the brightest end of this scale, and violet at the dark end, red in the middle. The place on this scale indicated the proportion of white and black that produced the color.","Tra Aristotele, Alessandro di Afrodisia de Vald√©s: Note su Simone Porzio|Vasoli, C.|<i>Rivista di Storia della Filosofia<i>, Vol 56, No 4, 2001, pp 561-607.",De coloribus libellus,A Small Book on Colors,,1548,1525-1550,Italian philosopher and lecturer in medicine at Pisa.

Oronce Fine,"Fine, Oronce",,1494-1555," ",De Speculo Ustorio,"Textbook on mathematical optics and parabolic burning mirrors, with mathematical analyses and methods of construction. Part of Fine's effort to revive mathematics at the University of Paris.","Oronce Fine set out to revive mathematics in Renaissance France, specifically in the curriculum at the Coll√®ge de France. <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i> and other books were his effort to provide the necessary awareness of mathematic and provide students textbooks. This is the origin of and intention for his textbook on mathematical optics and parabolic burring mirrors, which included mathematical analyses and methods of construction. As Fine stats in the preface, his most important optical source for <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i> was Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i>. Though Fine likely had access to the <i>Perspectiva's<i> printing in 1535, it is known that he worked from a manuscript copy before the 1535 printing. His other optical source was an edited version of Alhazen‚Äôs <i>De Speculis Comburentibus<i> which had been printed in 1548. Fine's parabolic geometry comes from Georgius Valla‚Äôs <i>De Expetendis et Fugiendis Rebus Opus<i> of 1501 and from Johann Werner‚Äôs Libellus of 1522. Though not of original material, the <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i> was a carefully crafted  compilation of sections of select texts, comprising a much-need textbook on catoptrics. It was the first such book printed in France and like his other books was widely popular, esteemed for its careful presentation, straightforward Latin, and the excellence of its figures. <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i>, along with several other of his books, became widely used throughout Europe at universities in need of up-to-date textbooks. In this, Fine took advantage not only of his knowledge of optics and geometry, but also of the need and ability of students.||An Italian translation of <i>De Speculo Ustorio<i> appeared in 1587 as an appendix to a translation of another of Fine‚Äôs books, <i>Protomathesis<i>. Fine's Propositions 8 and 9 were repeated nearly verbatim in Giovanni Battista Della Porta's <i>Magiae Naturalis<i> of 1558.
","Fine's textbook has the intention of exercising mathematical analysis in catoptrics, of showing the superior nature of paraboloids as burring mirrors, and to show practical methods to make such mirrors. First, there are 12 definitions involving conic sections, then four postulates involving the laws of reflection. There follow propositions, proved using Euclid's Elements, culminating in Proposition 7, showing that incoming rays parallel to the axis of the parabola are all reflected to the same point, the focus. Proposition 8 shows a way to draw a parabola and Proposition 9 demonstrates a way to construct a parabolic burning mirror using the method in Proposition 8. Proposition 10 involves the hyperbolic conic section, though it is not named as such. ","‚ÅÇ Oronce Fine's De Speculo Ustorio|Ross, R.

Girolamo Cardano,"Cardano, Girolamo",,1501-1576," ",De Subtilitate,"Encyclopedia on natural phenomena with a significant section on optics drawn from Peckham and Witelo, and containing the first mention of using a biconvex lens in a camera obscura.","Girolamo Cardano's attempt to present a complete compendium of natural philosophy. The material is fundamentally Aristotelian but not in any pure peripatetic form; it is amended, changed, and sometimes subverted with a wide variety of refinements and deviations. Though presented as an encyclopedia on natural phenomena, De Subtilitate is more of a miscellany; a kind of verbal cabinet of wonders that highlights Aristotelian shortfalls and opportunities for new explanations. In that way, <i>De Subtilitate<i> was at the vanguard of the reform of natural philosophy by introducing experientialism and empiricism, insisting as Cardano did, that experience is the only authority. This is a unique aspect of the <i>De Subtilitate<i>, for Cardano frequently introduces his own experience into his descriptions, making the entire narrative somewhat personal. Another unique aspect is the frequent use of mathematical calculations or demonstrations. That mathematics would be part of a natural philosophical discussion was uncommon, since mathematics was held to be incapable of revealing causes or characteristics of phenomena--it could only give a technical description. Cardano is also unique in rejecting the occult and esotericism, wanting to reform Aristotelian natural philosophy, revealing the  workings of the natural world to all, and not replace it with 'natural magic' that could be understood only by the initiated. This was one of the reasons for the book's great influence: it was read by craftsmen, mathematicians, alchemists, and such--any who used knowledge of the natural world--as well as the learned. Editions appeared at Paris in 1550 and 1551, at Nuremburg in 1550, at Basel in 1553, 1554, 1559, 1560, 1582, and 1611,  at Lyon in 1551, 1554, 1559, 1580, and 1615, and at Frankfurt in 1576, 1602, 1607. ","Cardano's <i>De Subtiltate<i> is in 21 books. 1: The Principles, Matter, Form, the Vacuum, the Resistance of Bodies, Natural Motion, and Position 2: The Elements, and Their Movements and Actions. 3: On Heaven. 4: On Light and Illumination. 5: On Mixture, and Incomplete or Metallic Mixed Things. 6: On Metals. 7: On Stones. 8: On Plants. 9: On Animals that are Generated from Decay. 10: On Perfect Animals. 11: On the Necessity and Form of Man. 12: On Man's Nature and Temperament. 13: On the Senses, What Can be Sensed, and Pleasure. 14: On the Soul and the Intellect. 15: On Useless Subtleties. 16: On the Sciences. 17: On the Arts and Artefacts. 18: On Marvels, and the Way to Represent Diverse Things Beyond Belief. 19: On Demons. 20: On Primary Substances or Lives. 21: On God and the Universe. Book 4 ranges over a wide variety of topics in optics, vision, and light without any apparent order: Celestial light sources, including the Milky Way; condensing mirrors; heat from light; luminous hot objects; color; light and color as requirements for vision; illumination as light in a transparent body and as color in an opaque one; mirrors and their making; reflection from objects; shadows; the atmosphere and twilight; the rainbow; the camera obscura; solar eclipse; burning mirrors; viewing mirrors convex and concave; sundials; sun shadows and surveying; refraction from crystals; illusions; painting and colors and pigments; solar and lunar motion. Most topics are treat briefly, and much is drawn from Peckham and Witelo, but the section on the rainbow is long and detailed.

Euclid,Euclid,Euclid of Alexandria,c295 BC,"Translated by Jean Pena (Jean de la P√®ne) (1528 - 1558) French educational reformer and student of the royal mathematician of France, Peter Ramus. Wrote and translated knowingly in mathematics and optics and famed for the preface written for this text: De usu optices praefatio, Preface on the use of optics.",Euclidis Optica et Catoptrica,"Pena's Latin translation from the Greek of Euclid's geometrical optics of vision and mirrors; includes the influential preface 'The Use of Optics.'","Jean Pena's Latin translation from the Greek of Euclid's <i>Optica<i> and the <i>Catoptrica<i> was prompted by his poor assessment of the commonly available translations. He was referring either to the text that appears in Georgius Valla's  <i>De Expetendis et Fugiendis Rebus Opus<i> in 1501 or to the translation of Bartolomeo Zamberti. In his preface, Pena agrees with the assessment of Francesco Maurolyco that earlier translators had insufficient knowledge of Perspectiva. Pena also notes that some theorems and many of the scholia are missing and that some demonstrations accompanied the wrong theorem. Pena worked from a Greek text of the <i>Optica<i> and <i>Catoptrica<i> that he was given by his mentor Peter Ramus. Pena sought to completely and accurately present the whole of the optical and vision teaching of Euclid, in part as a balance to what he considered the uncritical acceptance of Witelo and Peckham common at that time. ('I am not moved by the credulity of the vulgar, nor do I fear the opinion of Witelo, an optician of authority . . .') Pena presents the Euclidian work on the geometrical optics of vision and mirrors and even more influentially, includes the preface <i>De Usu Optices<i>, 'The Use of Optics.'-- for which Pena's book became famous. In it, he summarized optical principles including refraction, and claimed that practical astronomical knowledge and optical laws, demonstrated that Aristotle's celestial spheres could not exist. Aristotle's spheres and aether were simply air. The heavens were not fixed but fluid and that 'everything that the natural philosophers maintain about the sphere of fire, is imagination.' Pena's dismissal of Aristotelian cosmology was widely discussed and became part of the 16th century challenge to Aristotelianism generally. Pena's <i>De Usu Optices<i> was cited by Johannes Kepler in his <i>Dioptrice<i> of 1611.||Editions appeared in 1557 and 1604. An Italian translation by Ignatio Danti appeared in 1573. A French translation of the Geek of the Optica appeared in 1663. <i>De Usu Optices<i> appeared as an introduction to Friedrich Risner's <i>Optice Libri Quatuor<i> of 1606 and 1615. It also was printed in the posthumous collected works <i>Petri Rami Professoris Regii, Et Audomari Talaei Collectaneae Praefationes, Epistolae, Orationes<i> in 1577 and 1599.
","In Pena's Greek and Latin texts, presented side-by-side, there are 61 theorems in the Optica and 31 in the Catoptrica. He had studied optics carefully and knew it well, so the Latin translation was more accurate than previous translations. The  texts are preceded by Pena's long introductory essay 'De Usu Optices,' On the use of Optics, in which he assessed some of the teachings of Witelo and Peckham that he considered erroneous. He argued that though both authors were great scholars, nothing should be accepted until experimentally demonstrated. Pena rejects Witelo's accounting (coming from Alhazen's De Aspectibus) of the intromission theory of vision, supporting the Euclidian idea of rays emanating from the eye. Pena also criticized Peckham's account of the Milky Way light reflected from sun and stars. More importantly, Pena sets out his ideas on astronomy, cosmology, and physics, supporting them by optical arguments. According to Pena, the matter of the heavens was not Aristotelian aether but air. In the essay, Pena detailed how optical theory spoke against a heavenly ether and the celestial spheres that moved the planets and stars. Given the irrefutable facts of refraction, Pena states, that light from the fixed stars would be refracted each time it passed through one of the celestial spheres and 'the fixed stars observed elsewhere than at the zenith, through other media, would never be perceived in their true place.' If that is so, he says, astronomy is worthless. Pena also discussed how optics can explain coronae, the rainbow, and mock suns.||Latin translations of Euclid's <i>Optica<i> and <i>Catoptrica<i> were first printed in Georgius Valla's massive compendium <i>De Expetendis et Fugiendis Rebus Opus<i> printed by Aldus at Venice in 1501, but they both first appeared together in the first Latin edition of Euclid's collected works in 1537. The <i>Optica<i> is the first Greek work on vision and perspective--the earliest surviving text on optics and light in the western world. The <i>Optica<i> presents the phenomena of visible light and the Euclidian idea of vision rays emanating from the eye, comfortably aligned with and analyzed by geometry. It re-emerged as an important text in the 15h century for its use in the theory of linear perspective. The <i>Catoptrica<i>, a treatise on mirrors attributed by Proclus to Euclid, covers the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed by plane and spherical concave mirrors.","Liber de visu : The Greco-Latin Translation of Euclid's Optics|Theisen, W.R.|<i>Mediaeval Studies<i>, Vol 41, 1979, pp 44-105.||ùëª The Optics of Euclid|Burton, H.E., translator|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i>, Vol 46, No 5, 1945, pp 357-372.||ùëª <i>The medieval Latin traditions of Euclid's Catoptrica: A Critical Edition of De speculis with an Introduction, English Translation, and Commentary<i>|Takahashi, K.|Kyushu University Press, 1992, 373 p.||<i>From Sight to Light<i>|Smith, A.M.|University of Chicago Press, 2015, 457 pp, NB: pp 47-64.||Jean Pean (1528-58) and Stoic Physics in the Sixteenth Century|Barker, P.|<i>The Southern Journal of Philosophy<i>, 1985, Vol XXIII, Supplement||<i>Change and Continuity in Early Modern Cosmology<i>|Boner, P.J., editor|Spring, 2011, 181 pp, NB: 40-48.||The Challenge of Applied Optics|In: <i>The Unmaking of the Medieval Christian Cosmos, 1500‚Äì1760<i>|Randles, W.G.L.|Routledge, 2016, 296 pp||Atmospheric Refraction and the Ramus Circle: Aspects of a Late Sixteenth-Century Dispute|Peoux, G.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 67, No 4 , 2010, pp 457-484.||Peripatetic and Euclidean theories of the visual ray|Jones, A.|<i>Physis<i>, Vol 31, No 1, 1994, pp 47-76.","ŒïŒ•ŒöŒõŒïŒôŒîŒüŒ• ŒøœÅœÑŒπŒ∫Œ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒøœÄœÑœÅŒπŒ∫Œ± Euclidis Optica et Catoptrica, Nunquam antehac graece aedita.

Giambattista della Porta,"Porta, Giambattista della",Giovanni Battista Della Porta,c1535-1615," ",Magi√¶ Naturalis Libri IIII,"Natural Magic is presented as the practical part of natural philosophy; that is, instruments, practice, and effects. Vison, mirrors and lenses are considered in the optics section.
","Giambattista Della Porta's <i>Magiae Naturalis Libri IIII<i>, his early book on natural magic appeared in 1558. For Della Porta, Natural Magic was the practical part of natural philosophy and focused on exceptional, unusual, extraordinary phenomena, rather than the quotidian. It was the recognition and mastering of natural phenomena, in particular, those phenomena that had to be sought out, phenomena that were otherwise hidden. The point was not to explain the phenomena, but to be able to (re)produce it, display it, describe it and thus reveal nature's secrets. Girolamo Ruscelli, a member of Napes <i>Accademia Segreta<i> published his <i>I Segreti del reverendo dono Alessio Piemontese<i> in 1553. This academy and the famed book of secrets likely inspired Della Porta, being the pattern for his own <i>'Accademia dei Segreti<i>, The Academy of Mysteries, in Naples. He and its few members pursued experiments, demonstrations, crafts, and recipes. These formed the basis for the <i>Magiae Naturalis Libri IIII<i> of 1558, which was an immediate success and  established Della Porta‚Äôs reputation as a magus and professor of secrets in Europe. Della Porta was only 23 at the time and his notions of Natural Magic were quite grandly conceived. Though the book and its author would change in the thirty-year course of its expansion, one aspect did not: the notion that explaining natural phenomena and unlocking the secrets of nature are fundamentally esoteric activities. The book is dedicated to Philip II of Spain--in hopes of patronage, no doubt. Editions of the <i>Magiae Naturalis Libri IIII<i> appeared at Naples in 1558, at Antwerp in 1560, 1561, 1562, 1564, 1567, 1576 , 1584, 1585, and 1586, at Leyden  in 1561, at Colone in 1562, at Lyons in 1565, 1569, 1572, and 1578, at Venice in 1588. The second, much expanded edition, appeared in 1588
","Giambattista Della Porta presents natural magic as the practical part of natural philosophy; that is, instruments, practice, and effects. Della Porta gives his meaning of Natural Magic at the opening of the first book: 'What is Natural Magic? . We divide the magic into two parts, namely in an infamous one, composed of enchantments, of foul spirits and born of an evil curiosity, that the Greeks, more learned call Go√´tsia or Theurgia; it is the one that arouses charms and phantoms or illusions, which suddenly disappear, without leaving the slightest trace. The other part is natural magic, which everyone reveres or honors, because there is nothing higher or more enjoyable for lovers of good literature, who feel that it is nothing else than natural philosophy, or the supreme science.'||There are 4 books, the first sets out the basic principles which govern natural magic. The later three books are compilations of 'wonderful' recipes and phenomena. Each entry is brief and is usually just an oracular statement; no evidence or analysis is given. Those entries related to optics deal with miraculous lights and lamps, and mirrors of several types. The material on mirrors became some of the books most famous entries, involving concave mirrors that produced startling virtual images.","Knowing by doing in sixteenth-century natural magic: Giambattista della Porta and the wonders of nature|Saito, F.|<i>Circumscribere<i>, Vo1 14, 2014, pp 17-39||<i>Science and the Secretes of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture<i>|Eamon, W.|Princeton University Press, 1994, 490 pp, NB: pp 210-233.||<i>The Optics of Giambattista della Porta(ca. 1535‚Äì1615): A Reassessment<i>|Borrelli, A., Hon, G., Zik, Y., editors|Springer, 2017, 205 pp, NB: pp 11-39.",Magiae Naturalis sive De Miraculis Rerum Natualium Libri IIII.

The theory of vision, color, and light is entirely Peripatetic .","Frans Titelmans' textbook of Aristotelian natural philosophy was written for use in the Quadrivium. The Reformation and Counter Reformation had a significant impact on natural philosophy, making it important for Christians of any denomination as an exploration of God's creation and a method for moral and catechetical instruction. In his preface Titelmans writes 'I saw that the discipline of physics, if it was treated rightly and according to
its dignity, was of the greatest importance to sacred Theology and for the fuller knowledge of God.' Textbooks of all confessions framed natural philosophy as a pious exercise, including Titelmans which is tinctured deeply with Christian orthodoxy and instruction--in his case with psalmist piety. The book was widely used in religious schools and remained so into the next century until Jesuit textbooks began to appear. Editions of the <i>Compendium<i> appeared at Paris in 1542, 1547, 1562, and 1566, at Lyon in 1545, 1551, 1564, and 1596, at Antwerp in 1570, and at Venice in 1572. 
","Titelmans' text is in 12 books. 1: Principles of natural things. 2: Cause of natural things. 3: Motion and its accidents. 4: Infinity, place, vacuum, and time. 5: Generation and corruption of natural things. 6: meteorics. 7: The heavens and the earth. 8: Life in general, plants, lives of animals. 9: Exterior senses and what they sense. 10: Interior senses, sleep and vision. 11: The intellect. 12: Appetites and the excellence of will. The optical material is in book 9. The theory of vision, color, and light is entirely Aristotelian, modified by medieval Perspectiva. Titlemans describes the structure of the Aristotelian-Galenic eye, with the 'crystalinus' (crystalline lens) being the seat of vision, receiving species from visible objects. Color is the precipitator of vision and what is received by eye from the viewed object, color being an inherent property of the object. Light actualizes the potential transparency of a medium, allowing the transmission of color's species to the eye. Though species themselves are not visible, they produce the visual sensation. Lumen is a type of light, and Lux is what is seen in Lumen.

Titus Lucretius Carus,"Lucretius Carus, Titus",,94-c50 BC,Edited by Hubert van Giffen,De Rerum Natura,"Hubert van Giffen's edited text of 'On the Nature of Things' by Titus Lucretius Carus, presenting Epicurean natural philosophy.","Plantin's first printing of the text edited by the Dutch humanist Hubert van Giffen, professor of law in Strasbourg, Altdorf and Ingolstadt and advisor to Emperor Rudolf II. As with most copies, though printed in 1565, this copy 's title page  bears the date 1566; printed for purposes of marketing it at the Frankfurt book fair that year. In addition to the Lucretian poem, this edition also contains the original Greek text of Epicurus' Letter to Herodotus, in which he expresses his theories on Physics and Meteorics, various passages on Epicurus taken from the works of Cicero, and an extract from the Greek text of Thucydides on the plague of Athens. van Giffen dedicated the work to Johannes Sambucus (that is, J√°nos Zs√°mboky) Hungarian humanist, physician, philologist and historian. Zs√°mboky is the source for the editions' marginal philological notes and the very extensive final index.||Early printings of  <i>De Rerum Natura<i> vary widely in accuracy, detail, and emphasis--its manuscript tradition being uncertain. The oldest two manuscripts are of 9th century Carolingian origin. Another tradition is formed by Italian manuscripts all originating from Poggio Bracciolini's discovery in 1417 of a manuscript of Lucretius‚Äôs <i>De natura rerum<i> in  the library of a Swiss monastery. Thus, when printed edition began to appear, the result depended heavily on the editor, his available sources, the manuscript tradition he adhered to, and his background. There are 54 Renaissance manuscripts extant.||The editio princeps appeared at Brescia around 1473 and, like the editions that appeared in 1486 Verona and in 1495 at Venice, was filled with errors. A corrected Aldine quarto edited by Hieronymus Avancius appeared at Venice in 1500. The last Aldine edition appeared in 1515, printing a text edited by Andrea Navagero. It's text dominated printed editions for 50 years. The Parisian Aristotelian Denys Lambin (1520‚Äì1572) published a corrected text accompanied by a massive 300,000-word commentary In 1563. Though scholarly important, Lambin's work was impractically large and expensive. Its rival became this edition produced by van Giffen, which was better suited for general and student use. Both were used until the 18th century. In all, 30 editions were printed before 1600. Translations appear in French in 1650, in English in 1656 and 1680, in Italian in 1669, in Dutch in 1701, and German in 1784.","Lucretius adhered to the philosophy of Epicurus, who, writing 200 years before, advanced an atomism as the foundation of the natural world and, of a consequence, held that the gods cannot and do not influence the affairs of men. In its nearly 7500 lines, Lucretius's didactic poem has as its object the freeing of man from ignorance and the thralldom of religion and to provide guidance for a better lived life. It has six books. Book 1: The nature of atoms and the void; Rook 2: The properties and combinations of atoms in the diverse phenomena of the world; Book 3: The nature of the soul and its mortality; Book 4: The nature of our perception of the physical world, dreams, illusions and sex; Book 5: The history of the world and the development of mankind and a range of celestial and terrestrial phenomena; Book 6: A description of the great plague of Athens of 430 BC.||Book 4 begins with a long explanation of the physical nature of perception, including the idea of vision based on the ocular reception of simulacra emitted by viewed objects, and a list of and reasons for optical illusions. Though the senses, including vision, are presented as limited, Lucretius holds they are reliable enough to be the basis for behavioral choice.","Some problems in Lucretius‚Äô account of vision'|Sharples, R.W.|Leeds International Classical Studies, Vol 1, No 2, 2002, pp 1-11.||Titi Lucreti Cari De Rerum Natura Libri Sex|Bailey, C.|3 vols, Oxford, Oxford University Press, , 1947.||Lucretius: ‚ÄòDe Rerum Natura‚Äô IV, Godwin, J.|Aris & Phillips Classical Texts, 1986, pp 182.||A bibliography of Lucretius|Gordon, C.A.|St. Paul‚Äôs Bibliographies,Winchester, 1985, 323 pp.

Based on <i>De Aspectibus<i>, the 13th century Latin translation of ùë≤ùíäùíïùíÇÃÑùíÉ ùíÇùíç-ùë¥ùíÇùíèùíÇÃÑùíõÃ£ùíäùíì‚Äé, Ibn al-Haytham's Arabic original.
","Friedrich Risner's editing and the first printing of the most influential optics book ever written was a milestone in the history of optics. Risner's text is from manuscripts of the <i>De Aspectibus<i>, a 13th century Latin translation of KitƒÅb al-ManƒÅ·∫ìir, 'The Book of Optics.' The KitƒÅb al-ManƒÅ·∫ìir was completed at the Fatimid capital of Cairo sometime between 1028 and 1038 by Ab≈´  ΩAlƒ´ al-·∏§asan ibn al-·∏§asan ibn al-Haytham, the greatest physicist of the Islamic Golden Age. A Latin translation appeared in the  West no later than 1200--perhaps earlier--and began circulating. While <i>De Aspectibus<i> and Alhacen are the title and author given in the incipit of most medieval manuscripts, Risner titled his edition <i>Opticae Thesaurus Alhazeni Arabis<i>. The <i>De Aspectibus<i> was not only a cogent synthesis of ancient and early medieval optics but also a major advance. Alhacen subsumed Aristotle, Euclid, and Ptolemy, and produced an experimentally-based physics of light, a revolutionary theory of vision, a detailed consideration of perception, and an elaborate, highly mathematical geometrical optics. <i>De Aspectibus<i> advanced experimental natural philosophy, established a taxonomy of visual perception, created a centripetal system that unified the many centrifugal aspects of optics, and so laid the foundations of medieval Perspectiva.||Risner's preface gives the edition's origin: Prompted by his mentor Petrus Ramus, he undertook the editing task using two manuscripts, one provided by Ramus. Risner's editorial work was extensive and significant: structure was added to the text, including dividing it into propositions, adding enunciations and cross-references, and citing sources. All of this made it easier to study than any of the manuscript copies. The typography is easy to read, abbreviations were kept to a minimum, and the figures were added to and significantly improved. The latter was particularly important in the highly technical parts of the text.||The influence of Alhacen's <i>De Aspectibus<i> was profound. Between the time of its appearance and about 1400, virtually every optics text in the Latin West either cited it explicitly or bore its influence, and all were derivative, smaller in scope, and shorter in length. By 1325 it was in use at Universities. Optics texts from the advent of printing until the end of the 17th century all show the influence of the <i>De Aspectibus<i>. The greatest opticians of the age read and learned from Risner's Opticae Thesaurus; Thomas Hariot, Johannes Kepler, Willebrord Snell, and Ren√© Descartes all cited the work. 100 years after its publication, Isaac Barrow cited the work in his Lectiones Opticae et Geometricae of 1674. The Opticae Thesaurus swept the field of optics, being considered by contemporaries to treat all of then-current optics and becoming the foremost advanced optics text of the Renaissance. 
","Risner divides the <i>De Aspectibus<i> into seven books. Book 1: Mechanisms of vision, involving the nature of light and color, their propagation, and the structure of the eye. Book 2: Direct vision by incident rays, visual perception and its 22 'intentions.' Book 3: Vision defects, failures, and deceptions involving size, shape, and position. Book 4: Reflection and its laws, its mathematics, its cause. A discussion of mirrors and their making, and an analysis of reflection from plane, spherical, and cylindrical mirrors. Book 5: A detailed, nearly opaque mathematical analysis of image-formation from mirrors, including two-dimensional and 3-dimensional problems. Book 6: Visual errors caused by reflected images. Book 7: Refraction and its laws, its mathematics, its cause, including a discussion of image formation by refraction at surfaces of various shapes. Modern scholarship has revealed that the Latin <i>De Aspectibus<i> lacks the first three of the eight chapters in Book 1 of the Arabic original which deal with the direct propagation of light. Book 1 presents many of Alhacen's experiments to determine the nature of light; it linear propagation, it's failure to interact when beams intersect, and its diffusion when striking surfaces. Book 2 presents a theory of vision that solves the problem of all earlier intromissionist theories: if objects emit light rays from every point into every direction, how can such a confusion of rays reaching the eye result in a clear image? Alhacen proposes that only rays perpendicular to the spherically-curved cornea are sufficiently strong to get to the crystalline. The result is a one-to-one mapping of points on an object to points on the eye. It is also in this book that Alhacen considers and develops his 22 intentions of visual perception, classifying and describing the steps from the physical input of rays, to the final mental perception. He wrote 'Nothing visible is understood by the sense of sight alone, save light and colors.' Alhacen's sophisticated ideas regard visual perception had a significant effect on Medieval thought. Book 4 also presents experiments, these to verify the nature of reflection from mirrors. It is here that Alhacen presents his ballistic metaphor for reflection; the trajectory of a ball encountering a hard, fixed surface. Book 5 presents and solves (among other things) what has come to be called 'Alhacen's Problem': given the positions of object and eye, find the place on a spherical mirror where image reflection takes place. Book 7 is considerably more brief in its treatment of refraction then that given to reflection in Books  4-6. In it, Ptolemy's tables of refraction angles are considered, edited, and extended.

Witelo of Silesia,Witelo of Silesia,Vitello,c1230-c1280,"Edited by Friedrich Risner (1522 - 1580) German mathematician and student of Petrus Ramus, studied and wrote in optics in France.",Optic√¶ libri decem,"Risner's editing of Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i>, a widely used redaction of <i>De Aspectibus<i>, the 13th century Latin translation of the Arabic original ùë≤ùíäùíïùíÇÃÑùíÉ ùíÇùíç-ùë¥ùíÇùíèùíÇÃÑùíõÃ£ùíäùíì‚Äé, of Ibn al-Haytham. Prefaced by a significant exposition of necessary mathematics. ","Friedrich Risner's editing and additions to the text produced by Georg Tannstetter and Peter Apian and printed in 1535 and  reprinted in 1551.  Risner's edition of 1572 superseded Tannstetter and Apian's edition.  He added references to Euclid's Elements to most of the propositions in Witelo's first book covering geometry. Risner adds numbering to the defintions and propositions in the Tannstetter text, and uses the same figures. The numbering of those sections in the Tannstetter text that have Roman Numerals is preserved but change to Arabic numbers. In this way, Risner had a very light touch when dealing with the Tannstetter text.||Tanstetter had edited Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i>, the widely used redaction of <i>De Aspectibus<i>, the 13th century Latin translation of the Arabic original KitƒÅb al-ManƒÅ·∫ìir, 'Book of Optics', of Ibn al-Haytham. As with other printings of the <i>Perspectiva<i>, this has it roots in the manuscript tradition. Written in about 1275 while Witelo was at the Papal court at Viterbo, it is a redaction and augmenting of Alhazen's De Aspectibus which had begun to circulate in the Latin West early in the 13th century. It, in turn, was a Latin translation of KitƒÅb al-ManƒÅ·∫ìir‚Äé, the Arabic original of Ab≈´  øAlƒ´ al-·∏§asan ibn al-·∏§asan ibn al-Haytham of around 1050. While John Peckham's Perspectiva Communis was medieval Europe's most used basic optics text, Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i> was the advanced, comprehensive equivalent; more than 25 manuscripts are still extant. There were several reasons for its utility.  First, though following Alhazen closely, Witelo imposed a Euclid-like structure of theorems or propositions, including enunciations, definitions, and proofs. This made the text more accessible and didactic; significantly more useful as a textbook than Alhazen's <i>De Aspectibus<i>. Second, Witelo's Perspectiva included a long first book that introduced all the plane and three-dimensional geometry that would be required to study the subsequent text. Though it contained no original mathematics, it brought the necessary geometry to bear directly on optics. Third, Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i> included topics not covered in the De Aspectibus, including mirror foci, refraction by glass spheres, and atmospheric refraction.||By the end of 15th century perspectival optics was in the curriculum at the universities of Paris, Vienna, Prague, Leipzig, Krakow, Oxford, Cambridge, and others, and Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i> among the principal optics texts in use. In 1472 Johannes M√ºller von K√∂nigsberg, better known as Regiomontanus, published at Nuremburg a prospectus of manuscripts he intended to edit and have printed; number 12 on the list was 'Perspectiva Vitelonis.' But a printed edition did not appear until 1535 when Georg Tannstetter and his astronomer-pupil Peter Apian edited the text for the Nuremburg press of Johannes Petreius. The intention was to produce a book that could be used at the University of Vienna where Tannstetter taught. It would be from the <i>Perspectiva<i> of Witelo that Renaissance Europe learned optics and the source for many optical texts that would appear subsequently. Including Johannes Kepler, prompting him to publish his <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> in 1604.","Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i> is in 10 books. 1: Geometry. 2: Light, light rays, and shadows. 3: Structure and function of the eye. 4: Seeing and perception. 5: Reflection at plane surfaces. 6: Reflection at curved surfaces. 7: Reflection at conical surfaces. 8: Reflection at spherical surfaces. 9: Burning mirrors, their foci and construction. 10: Refraction, the rainbow, and other meteorics. Aside from the important Euclidian structure imposed on the De Aspectibus, Witelo's Perspectiva contains most of Alhazen's material and does not differ in any fundamental way on most optical issues: Theory of vision, nature and propagation of light, the empirical method, apparatus, and experiments, and geometric analysis--all are in the <i>Perspectiva<i> as they are in the <i>De Aspectibus<i>. In this sense, Witelo has been called Alahzen's commentator or more derogatorily, as Maurolyco had it, his ape. But in some ways, Perspectiva is importantly different from De Aspectibus. Witelo's Perspectiva begins with a significant exposition of necessary mathematics; the first book is devoted to geometry and is important and unique to the Perspectiva. Like Alhazen, Witelo cites Ptolemy on angles of refraction, repeating the values from the Optica. But unlike Alhazen, Witelo attempts and analysis and extension and gets tangled in errors. Witelo's extensive treatment of the parabolic burning mirror and his treatment of the rainbow is not found in the <i>De Aspectibus<i>. This is the edition of Witelo's work used by and referred to Johannes Kepler.","<i> Opticae Thesaurus<i>|Introduction to this reprint edition by Lindberg, D.|Johnson Reprint Corporation, 1972, pp v-xxxiv.||ùëª <i>Witelionis Perspectivae Liber Primus<i>|English translation of Book I of Witelo's Perspectiva|Unguru, S., translator|Polish Academy of Sciences, 1977|http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/editions-content?id=31621||ùëª <i>Witelonis Perspectivae Liber Secundus Et Liber Tertius<i>|Engligh translation of Books II and III of Witelo's Perspectiva|Unguru, S., translator|Polish Academy of Sciences, 1991|http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/editions-content?id=32531||ùëª <i>Witelionis Perspectivae Liber Quartus<i>|English translation of Book 4 of Witelo's Perspectiva (Thesis)|Kelso C.

Commentaries and figures accompany the translation.","Egnatio Danti worked on his translations of the optics works of Euclid and Heliodorus at the end of his time in Florence. He based his Italian translation on Jean Pena's Latin translation of 1557 of the Greek text of Euclid's <i>Optica<i>. Though Danti had access to Greek manuscripts of the Euclid <i>Optica<i> held in the Medici Library, he chose to use Pena's Latin; doing so with only indirect attribution. Additionally, Danti's preface is a translated, shortened unacknowledged paraphrase of the preface <i>De Usu Optices<i> from Jean Pena's text of 1557. Commentaries and figures accompany Danti's translation, with the commentaries being more important and influential than the Euclidian text itself. Included is Danti's Latin and Italian translations the <i>Capita Optica<i> of Heliodorus of Larrisa. 
","Egnatio Danti's interest in optics centered on its relation to and support of linear perspective and art and thus his extensive commentaries focus on that. The paraphrase of Pena's De Usu Optices is used to support Danti's view that astronomy, geography, and particularly perspective, need to be in the hands of natural philosophers and those that understand optics. Danti's commentaries focus on the first two of Euclid's suppositions: the linear propagation of emitted visual rays, and their composition into the cone of vision. Danti also gives a considerable historical summary of optics, particularly that dealing with the conflicting theories of extromission, as in Euclid, and medieval intromission as presented by Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i>. Though Danti seems to support the intromission theory, he is coyly avoids explicit endorsement. Importantly, Danti does not feel the need to present arguments one way or the other, only to make clear Euclid's ideas.||A significant aspect of Danti's comments derive from commentaries on Aristotle's <i>De Anima<i> and <i>De Sensu<i>, particularly Maynetius' commentary of 1555. Importantly Danti claims that siding with either the extromission or intromission theories--the Euclidian or Aristotelian--is unnecessary, since straight rays, regardless of their direction of travel, are the essential aspect of optics that supports the theory of linear perspective.","Egnatio Danti's Optics: Cinquecento Aristotelianism and the Medieval Tradition|<i>Nuncius<i>, Vol 3, No 1, 1988, pp 3 -38.ùëª The Optics of Euclid|Burton, H.E., translator|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i>, Vol 46, No 5, 1945, pp 357-372.||ùëª <i>The medieval Latin traditions of Euclid's Catoptrica: A Critical Edition of De speculis with an Introduction, English Translation, and Commentary<i>|Takahashi, K.|Kyushu University Press, 1992, 373 pp.||<i>Campanus of Novara and Euclid's Elements<i>|Busard, H.L.L.|Franz Steiner Verlag, 2005, 535 pp, NB pp 1-46.||<i>From Sight to Light<i>|Smith, A.M.|University of Chicago Press, 2015, 457 pp, NB: pp 47-64.||Pseudo-Euclidean reflections in ancient optics: a re-examination of textual issues pertaining to the the Euclidean Optica and Catoptrica|Knorr, W.|<i>Physis<i>, Vol 31, No 1, 1994, pp 1-45.||Peripatetic and Euclidean theories of the visual ray|Jones, A.|<i>Physis<i>, Vol 31, No 1, 1994, pp 47-76.","La Prospettiva di Euclide, Nella quale si tratta di quelle cose, che per raggi diritti si veggono: & di quelle, che con raggi reflessi nelli specchi appariscono.","The Perspectiva of Euclid, in which is treated those things which are seen by direct rays, and those with reflected rays which appear in mirrors.",Italian,1573,1550-1575,"Ancient author of geometry, taught at Athens and Alexandria.",1,1573,,,Florence,Jacopo and Filippo Giunti,,,Bound with La Prospettiva di Eliodoro Larisseo,"‚ãÜ‚Å¥ A-S‚Å¥ œá¬π (C‚ÇÅ, P‚ÇÅ , R‚ÇÅ not signed)",[ùü†] 1-110 [ùüõùüû],,The Italian translation of Euclid and the Greek/Latin Heliodorus each have their own title page.,Modern 1/2 Red Morocco Over Marbled Boards,4,215,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1573 Euclid - La Prospettiva di Euclide - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/1339/10/la-prospettiva-di-euclide/,32,Libreria Antiquaria C.E.

Written for students and preachers, it covered divine and human life, the natural world, Earth and the heavens. Numerous sources were cited.

","The <i>De proprietatibus Rerum<i> of Bartholomaeus Anglicus (Bartholomew the Englishman) is one of the most widely read Medieval encyclopedias and one of the most frequently printed. Written for students and preachers no later than 1240, it covered divine and human life, the natural world, Earth and the heavens. Bartholomew's encyclopedia filled a need for a compact source of knowledge for those without access to libraries or large specialized textbooks. One of the reasons it was immensely popular for centuries was that is was not a manual of the arts but a source for 'science' and secular knowledge; there are more than 200 manuscript copies extant. Nevertheless, Bartholomew wrote not to consider the nature of things for their own sake, but rather to better reveal Scripture. The book gives a view of middle and late medieval common knowledge and because Bartholomew did not consider nor wish to present himself as an authority, the many sources he cites gives insight into information and texts available at end of the 13th century. The book was popular enough to be translated into French in 1372 by Jean Corbichon, into English in 1398 by John Trevisa, into Spanish by Vincent de Burgos late in the 14th century, and into Dutch, Italian, and Proven√ßal.||Latin editions appeared in ca 1472, ca 1475, 1480, 1481, two in 1482, 1483, 1485, 1488, 1491, 1492, 1505, 1519, 1601, and 1609. French editions appeared in 1482, two in 1485, 1487, 1491, 1500, 1510, 1518, 1522 (2), 1525, 1538, 1539, six in 1556. A Dutch printing appeared in 1485. A Spanish printing in 1494 and 1529. Printed editions appeared in England in 1495, 1535, and 1582; the later being Thomas Berthelet's English edition, amended and enlarged by Stephen Batman; the present copy.
","<i>De Proprietatibus Rerum<i> contains 19 books. 1: God. 2: Angels and demons. 3: Psychology. 4-5: Physiology. 6: Family life and domestic economy. 7: Medicine. 8: Cosmology and astrology. 9: Time divisions. 10: Form and matter, the elements. 11: Air and meteorology, 12: Flying creatures. 13: Waters and fishes, dolphins, and whales. 14-15: Physical and political geography. 16: Gems, minerals, and metals. 17: Trees and herbs. 18: Animals. 19: Color, odor, savor; food and drink; weights and measures; musical instruments. The material on vision is in Chapter 17 of Book 3 and Bartholomew gives an unnamed author's work precedence over that of Constantine the African on matters of vision. Presumably this is a reference to Constantine's translation, the<i>Liber Pantegni<i>, of an Arabic medical text. The unnamed author and work cannot be Alhazen and <i>De Apsectibus<i>; it is likely to be Robert Grosseteste. Bartholomew presents vision based on three coincident pyramids, with apex at the pupil and base at the viewed object. The three pyramids contain: species emitted from the object, a visual fluid emitted by the eye, and light--a substance illuminating the object. Though Light is always present, it illuminates only a body in a condition to receive it. Following the ancients, three types of vision are presented: direct, reflected, and refracted.||The eye and ocular anatomy is presented in Chapters 5, 6, and 7 of Book 5. The material comes from Isidore of Saville's <i>Etymologiae<i> and from the medical translations of Constantine the African (the <i>Liber Pantegni<i>, most likely), both of which are cited. The anatomy presented is entirely Galenic. Rays, pyramids, and species are presented with the mixed vagueness typical before the wide-spread appearance  Alhacen's <i>De Aspectibus<i> in the Latin West in the 13th century. Bartholomew's material on color in chapter 1 of book 19 is copied, almost verbatim, from Robert Grosseteste's <i>De Colore<i> of around 1220.||When Batman took up the project of producing a new edition of Bartholomew, he repurposed the <i>De Proprietatibus Rerum<i> from its original intent--meeting the needs of then-new 13th century Franciscans working at expanding Christendom--to the needs of Elizabethan England. The work Batman produced can be consider a contemporary commentary of Bartholomew. This is reflected in the changes and updating he made to Bartholomew's text, the additional material he added, and the extensive range of modern authorities he cites. This is particular apparent in the material on cosmography. Batman also makes a significant alteration to Book 19 by inserting a long passage on limning into the sequence of chapters on colors, altering the focus from the properties of light and its spiritual significance, to the properties of pigments and the techniques of applying them to surfaces. Throughout the rest of the text, Batman's glosses, commentaries, and addenda appear in the printed margins.","‚ÅÇ The Journey of a Book: Bartholomew the Englishman and the Properties of Things|Keen, E.|ANU E Press, 2007, 199 pp, NB: pp 133-151.||Batman vppon Bartholome, His Booke De Proprietatibus Rerum.

Rafael Mirami,"Mirami, Rafael",,?-?," ",Compendiosa Introduttione alla prima parte della specularia,"An elementary consideration of the utility and properties of mirrors; fundamentally geometric  but larded with verse from Dante, Petrarch, Horace to support arguments.","Rafael Mirami's <i>Compendiosa<i> is a late Renaissance consideration of the utility and properties of mirrors. It is the product of the transition from the catoptrical optics of antiquity and its attempt to produce images from distant objects, to the development of dioptrical optics in the early 17th century that led to the telescope. Interestingly, and suggestive of late Renaissance humanism, Mirami's fundamentally geometric text is larded with verse from Dante, Petrarch, Horace to support his arguments. Glass developments in Venice early in 16th century made mirrors widely available and Mirami's work was written in hopes of elevating the intellectual study of mirrors, considering not only their manufacture, but also practical, astronomical, theoretical, and moral aspects; deemphasizing, if not ignoring, their use to amplify vanity or to produce visual tricks and 'lascivious use.' Mirami includes an elaborate Tavola that gives a schema of types of mirrors, their properties, their uses, and the types and place of images they produce.
","The <i>Compendiosa<i> has 25 chapters, each elaborating a different aspect of the phenomenon of reflection. Mirami begins by enumerating the fields of application of mirrors, among which astrology and philosophy; avoiding the usual parade of games and entertainments. In addition to its practical applications, Mirami deals with techniques of mirror making, problem related to images produced by mirrors, how images can be illusional or misleading. Columnar and pyramidal mirrors are considered, as well as how mirrors can multiply images. In the second part of the work, Mirami describes the application of mirrors for the construction of interior solar clocks by bringing the moving image of the sun to an interior space via mirrors. This work anticipated that of Athanasius Kircher and Emmanuel Maignan on catoptric meridians.","Corrispondenze ottico-prospettiche tra le opere di Maignan e di Borromini a palazzo Spada|C√†ndito, C.|<i>M√©langes de l'Ecole fran√ßaise de Rome<i>, Vol 117, No 1, 2005, pp 73-89.||http://www.nicolaseverino.it/Articoli/La meridiana a riflessione fu inventata da Raffaele Mirami.pdf||<i>Galileo's Glassworks: The Telecsope and the Mirror<i>|Eileen Reeves|Harvard University Press, 2008, 240 p.","Compendiosa Introduttione alla prima parte della specularia, Ci√≤ e dell scienze de gli specchi.

Recipes, experiments, and observations from 129 authorities, set out according to the logic of Peter Ramus, ranged from God to games.","Johann Jakob Wecker's <i>De Secretis Libri XVII<i> is the most famous, widely used, and frequently reprinted books of secrets. It is a 16th century encyclopedic exposition of arts, that is 'secrets,' in the form of a Latin compilation of recipes, experiments, and observations culled from 129 authorities ranging from Greek and Roman antiquity to then-contemporary European. His long list of authors supported Wecker's idea that history showed that 'the treasury of revelation of natural secrets is inexhaustible.' He organized his secrets according to the logic of Peter Ramus, and in a schema ranging from the secrets of God to the secrets of games and pastimes he produced a schema giving elaborate, nested, branching sets of subjects. The schema also served at a table of contents. <i>De Secretis Libri XVII<i>  is partly an encyclopedia of sciences, mainly physical, chemical, medical, and astrological, and partly a vast collection of various recipes. It includes secrets of metals, of glass, of jewels, and how to counterfeit them; of meteorics such as hail, rain, snow, thunder, lightning, tempests, and the like; of sciences, natural magic, mathematics, music, and astrology; secrets mechanical; secrets of sports, delights and recreations; medicine and herbal remedies; and a large section on cookery. Latin editions appeared in 1582, 1587, 1588, 1592, 1598, 1604, 1613, 1629, 1642, 1662, 1701, 1750.

An English translation appeared at London in 1660. 
","Johann Jakob Wecker's <i>De Secretis Libri XVII<i> contains material on optics that of its nature is popular, practical, and elementary. It is often a credulous mix of legend, oft-repeated folk lore, and natural philosophy. Scattered through the text are descriptions of: Archimedes' burning mirror; torches, candles, and lamps for lighting; color's nature and sources; object colors; light and its sources; the eye and vision; mirrors of various types; and optical illusions. However unreliable the source, or uncertain the fact itself, each entry reveals what was known and what was desired to be known about light, vision, and optics by popular readers in the Renaissance.||The most extensive material is on burning mirrors with a discussion based on authorities, including the explicit mention of Francesco Maurolyco and figures showing the construction of a parabola.","<i>Science and the Secrets of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture<i>|Eamon, W.|Princeton University Press, 1994, 490 pp, NB: pp 276-279.||<i>The Library: Curtis Schuh's Bibliography of Mineralogy<i>|http://mineralogicalrecord.com/libdetail.asp.",De Secretis Libri XVII,Seventeen Books of Secrets.,Latin,1582,1575-1600,Swiss physician,1,1582,,,Basel,,,,,(?)‚Å∏ ùî¥‚Å∏ ¬∂‚Å∏ a-z‚Å∏ A-Z‚Å∏ (V‚ÇÖ missigned as T‚ÇÖ) Aa-Oo‚Å∏,[1] 2-962,,,Contemporary Vellum,8,160,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1582 Wecker - De Secretis  - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0003/bsb00032759/images/index.html?seite=00001&l=de,38,Antiqua Leipzig GmbH,47.5649,7.6153
"Pierre de la  Ram√©e, ","Ram√©e, Pierre de la ",Petrus Ramus,1515-1572,"Edited by Joannes Piscator (1526-1625) German theologian, translator, textbook writer.",Scholarum Physicarum,"In the guise of a textbook, a running argument with the 8 books of Aristotle‚Äôs Physics. Part of the effort to reform education and replace Scholasticism.","Pierre de la Ram√©e's textbook <i>Scholarum Physicarum<i> is actually a running argument with the 8 books of Aristotle's Physics. Ram√©e famously broke with Aristotelianism in 1536, titling the disputation he defended for his master's examination 'All that Aristotle has said is false.' Textbooks and teaching were at the core of Ramee's effort to reform education and replace Scholasticism and he began writing textbooks in 1543 which by 1559 had generated a complete set for Trivium. He then wrote texts for the Quadrivium, including mathematics and physics. The <i>Scholarum Physicarum<i> presents a general alternative to Aristotelian physics, which Ram√©e considered to indulge in too many speculations and complains that 'if one should by means of his senses and reason investigate heaven and earth and all that therein is, as a physicist ought to do, then compare his results with the Physics of Aristotle, he would find in that work no observation of anything in nature, but only sophisms, theoretical speculations, and unsupported assertions.' However, much he disapproved of Aristotle, Ram√©e did not go so far as to embrace an inductive method for natural philosophy.|Editions appeared in 1565, 1583, and 1606.
","It is in his books on physics that Aristotle classifies the study of optics with mathematics, as opposed to physics, but considers it to have applications in the physical world. Aristotle notes that some types of mathematics are more physical than others, optics being the chief of these, being as it is so closely related to geometry. In his physics he gives an example, writing 'While geometry investigates natural lines but not qua natural, optics investigates mathematical lines, but qua natural, not qua mathematical.' That is, geometry treats lines, but not as boundaries of physical objects; optics, however, studies lines as they related to vision and rays of light. To all this Pierre de la Ram√©e objects, claiming that optics is part of physics, not mathematics, no matter how much it relies on geometry. He writes: 'Optics is of light, it presents itself to opaque, rare and dense media; the chief of which are qualities both physical and sensible.'","<i>Peter Ramus and the Educational Reformation of the Sixteenth Century<i>|Graves, F.P.|MacMillian, New York, 1912, 226 pp.","Scholarum Physicarum Libri Octo, in totidem Acromaticos libros Aristoteles.

Aristotle,Aristotle,The Philosopher',384-322 BC,Edited by Friedrich Sylburg (1536-1596) German classical scholar.,Problemata,"A collecton of questions based on observatons in natural philosophy, medicine, and meteorology.","The <i>Probelmata<i> is a multisided text that can be considered observational natural philosophy, medicine, and meteorology. It posses many questions, each stemming from a single observation of an everyday phenomena, and usually presents an answer (often tentative, hypothetical, or interrogative themselves) based on peripatetic teaching. The <i>Problemata<i> was always considered peripheral to the core of Aristotelian work, since it was not an attempt to establish a general overall explanatory system, but rather was a scattered collection of individual and particular instances of observations of phenomena. A kind of intellectual Pointillism. The collection formed an integral part of a vibrant tradition of medical-naturalist problemata literature in the Graeco-Roman imperial era, which included works such as Plutarch‚Äôs Naturales Quaestiones, the so-called Supplementa Problematorum, and the iatrosophist Cassius‚Äô Medical Problems. It is significance testimony to the role the <i>Problemata<i> played to the transmission of medical and natural scientific knowledge during the Roman Empire.||Although called 'pseudo-Aristotelian' in their final form of 38 books containing nearly 900 problems accumulated over the centuries by the Peripatetic school possibly as late as the 5th or 6th century CE, the 'Problems of Aristotle' developed from an authentic Aristotelian core and spawned a vigorous tradition of editions and imitations--the latter outlasting the active use of the rest of Aristotle's natural science, down to the eighteenth-century publication of works entitled 'Problems of Aristotle.' Collections of problemata, variously copied or imitated from Aristotle and other ancient models (notably Alexander of Aphrodisias, Plutarch and Cassius as in this edition), consisted of questions and answers about the causes of natural phenomena and elicited learned and popular interest to fuel over one hundred editions in the genre during the early modern period. The present Greek work is often confused with the medieval Latin collection <i>Problemata<i> that developed between the 13th and 15th centuries; a collection not based on the ancient text at all.||The editor of this text, Friedrich Sylburg, produced numerous Greek and Latin classics and patristic texts for the great printers Wechel in Frankfurt and Commelius in Heidelberg. His complete Aristotle, published over several years and in various combinations, was considered by many scholars to have been the finest edition to date. The present work is the forth time the Greek text of the <i>Problemata<i> appeared in print. The first was the Aldine Aristotle in 1495-1498, the second was that of Simon Grynaeus and Desiderius Erasmus printed by Johann Bebel at Basel in 1531 and reissued in 1539 and 1550, and Joannes Baptista Camotius' edition published by Aldine at Venice in 1551. Sylburg's edition contains the corrections of former publications and an improved text, as well as an <i>Adnotatio<i> and two indexes. The <i>Adnotatio<i> considers various readings of the Greek text, referencing Gaza's Latin translation to show his readings. The first index is to Greek vocabulary used in the <i>Problemata<i> and the second is a Latin subject index.","Many problems in the <i>Problemata<i> deal with the eye, optics, and vision: ||Book XV, Problem 6:  Why is it the case that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular?||Book XV, Problem 11: Why is it the case that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?||These problems show the ancient origin of the problem of describing how pin-hole images were formed. This is a topic visited by all medieval writers in optics and not correctly treated until the work of Marolyco and Kepler. Problem 13 Book XVI contains Aristotle's presentation of the mechanical analogy of reflection when describing a mirror image. There are also problems related to visual perception, such as 'Why is it that, although the moon is spherical, we see a straight line when it is halved?' and 'Why is it that, although the sun and moon are spherical, they appear flat?'||Several problems in the medical material deal with aspects of vision: Book 31, Problems 11, 14-17b, 19-22, and 25-28. Aristotle was also probably the first Greek author to try to explain why old people‚Äôs eyes see worse than those of younger people. This includes an explicit reference to presbyopia. Indeed, the word ‚Äòpresbyopes‚Äô was first used here in the <i>Problemata<i>, formed from the prefix 'presbys', meaning old man, in Greek, and the suffix 'ops', meaning eye.

The lines and angles of Euclid's geometry were used to describe the position and trajectory of vision rays--direct and reflected by mirrors. The <i>Optica<i> of Euclid re-emerged as an important text in the 15h century for it use in the theory of linear perspective.

Giambattista della Porta,"Porta, Giambattista della",Giovanni Battista Della Porta,c1535-1615," ",Magi√¶ Naturalis Libri Viginti,"Natural Magic is presented as the practical part of natural philosophy; that is, instruments, practice, and effects. Vison, mirrors and lenses are considered in the optics section.
","Giambattista Della Porta's <i>Magiae Naturalis Libri Viginti<i> was a significant expansion of his early book on natural magic of 1558. For Della Porta, Natural Magic was the practical part of natural philosophy and focused on exceptional, unusual, extraordinary phenomena, rather than the quotidian. It was the recognition and mastering of natural phenomena, in particular, those phenomena that had to be sought out, phenomena that were otherwise hidden. The point was not to explain the phenomena, but to be able to (re)produce it, display it, describe it and thus reveal nature's secrets. The author and the book changed considerably in the nearly thirty years that separated the first and second editions. Della Porta had mastered a large portion of classical humanist studies by 1589, including the medieval encyclopedias of secrets. From the latter, the scope of the book expanded considerably, and Della Porta established a long list of secrets which the second edition of the Magiae Naturalis was to 'reduce all those secrets into their  proper places.' The second edition is also considerably more experimental in the sense of the direct manipulation of nature. But one aspect of the book and its author did not change: the notion that explaining natural phenomena and unlocking the secrets of nature are fundamentally esoteric activities. Alchemy and Optics are significant portions of the Magiae Naturalis of 1589.|The <i>Magiae Naturalis Libri Viginti<i> established Della Porta's reputation as Europe's leading authority on natural magic. The book was tremendously popular and commercially successful; Antwerp's Pantin Press and Frankfurt's Wechel press were among dell Porta's publishers. Printings of the second, expanded Latin edition appeared in 1589, 1591, 1592, 1597, 1600, 1607, 1619, 1644, 1650, 1651, and 1664. An Italian translation appeared in 1611, a German translation appeared at Magdeburg in 1612 and 1617, French translations appeared at Lyon in 1615 and 1669, and at Rouen in 1657, an English translation appeared at London in 1658 and 1659.
","Giambattista Della Porta presents natural magic as the practical part of natural philosophy; that is, instruments, practice, and effects. There are 20 books: 1: Of the Causes of Wonderful things, 2: Of the Generation of Animals. 3:Of the Production of New Plants. 4: Of increasing Household Stuff. 5: Of changing Metals. 6: Of counterfeiting Gold. 7: Of the Wonders of the Loadstone. 8: Of strange Cures. 9: Of Beautifying Women. 10: Of Distillation.11: Of Perfuming. 12: Of Artificial Fires. 13: Of Tempering Steel. 14: Of Cookery. 15: Of Fishing, Fowling, Hunting, etc. 16: Of Invisible Writing. 17: Of Catoptric Images. 18: Of Statick Experiments. 19: Pneumatic Experiments. 20: Of the Chaos.  Of all the material covered, that considered in book 17 on vison, mirrors and lenses, (pp 259-286) is probably the most important, it was certainly that with the most extensive and lasting effect. It contains 23 topics: Plane mirrors; Plane mirror illusions; Mirrors for display and the theater; Concave mirrors; Plane and concave mirrors together; Other operations with concave mirrors; How to see in the dark, that which is illuminated by torches; How without a mirror or other device an image can hand in the air; Mixtures of mirrors and their images; The Crystalline Lens and its effects; Lenses for seeing far beyond what can be imagined; Camera obscura; Crystal prism; Burning mirrors; Parabolic burning mirrors and their construction; Parabolic section construction; Parabolic section for burning at infinite distances; Burning glass from spherical sections; Kindling fire more forcefully with refraction; Image outside a concave mirror; Making mirrors; Making plane, convex, and concave mirrors with applied and bonded foil; Making metallic mirrors.||Della Porta is not interested in explaining optical phenomena--he refers the reader to Archimedes, Euclid, Ptolemy, and Witelo--nor does he aim to discern and study the laws of optics to explain the effects. Rather, he seeks to demonstrate and show how it is possible to increase the effect of optical phenomena. The most influential topics are the camera obscura and lenses. Della Porta had added a mirror to the camera obscura to right the image, but by 1589 he places a lens in the aperture to clarify and amplify the image, and more importantly, to make the first suggestion that the eye is like a camera obscura. Concave mirrors are discussed and their numerous images presented in considerable detail. It is in connection with mirror images that Della Porta introduces the point of inversion (where rays cross, the focus) and the use of the cathetus to predict image location.","Knowing by doing in sixteenth-century natural magic: Giambattista della Porta and the wonders of nature|Saito, F.|<i>Circumscribere<i>, Vo1 14, 2014, pp 17-39||<i>Science and the Secretes of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture<i>|Eamon, W.|Princeton University Press, 1994, 490 pp, pp 210-233.||<i>The Optics of Giambattista della Porta(ca. 1535‚Äì1615): A Reassessment<i>|Borrelli, A., Hon, G., Zik, Y., editors|Springer, 2017, 205 pp, NB: pp 184-188.","Io.

Aristotle,Aristotle,The Philosopher',384-322 BC,Translated by Isaac Casaubon (1559 - 1614) French born English classical scholar and philologist.,Operum Aristotelis,"Famed Renaissance Greek scholar Casaubon's edition of Aristotle. Treated as the 'received text' for subsequent editors and editions for 200 years.
","Isaac Casaubon seems to have inherited the task of editing Aristotle's works from his teacher Julius Pacius. Casaubon's introduction gives other reasons this edition was undertaken. These include Casaubon's idea that philosophy was being left behind in the renaissance of arts and sciences, and more importantly to establish a bulwark against 'the new philosophy'--the anti-Aristotelianism of Pierre de la  Ram√©e. Though Ram√©e had been dead nearly 20 years in 1590, his thought was in fashion at the time and Casaubon was tendentiously opposed to it's neglect of the Ancients and its opposition to Aristotle. More distressing to Casaubon was the Ramist ignorance of High Literature.|Though he was already a famous Greek scholar by the time he worked on this edition of Aristotle's works, Casaubon's principle sources for his edition were earlier Latin editions; apparently, he consulted Greek manuscripts sparingly. An innovative aspect of this edition is Casaubon's use of marginalia to note textual variants, particularly those arising from manuscripts. He also uses marginalia to set discussion of difficult points, dubious readings, and his own conjectures. Casaubon's use of marginalia was the forerunner of the apparatus criticus of later textual scholarship. Casaubon's edition appeared in 1590 and was reprinted in 1605. Editions of Casaubon's text was prepared by subsequent editors and appeared in 1597, 1619, 1629, 1639, 1654 and many times in the 18th century. Casaubon's text was, for nearly 200 years, something near to a 'received text.' It was, for example, the basis for the <i>Aristotelis Opera Omnia Quae Extant Graec√® & Latin√®<i> of Guillaume Duval of 1619. The appearance of Casaubon's text marks the beginning of the end of the translation and commentary literature based on Aristotle. Early in the 17th century, philosophical textbooks became the principal mechanism by which Aristotle was studied. Their summaries and pedagogical reworkings replaced the reading of the original text.
","Casaubon's texts include all the works of Aristotle that contain some component of optics: The four books of <i>De Meteorologicorum<i>; the four books of <i>De Caelo<i>; the three books of <i>De Anima; De Sensu et Sensibilia<i>; <i>De Coloribus<i>; and the <i>Problemata<i>. Aristotle's writings that concerned optics dealt with visual perception and thought, the mechanisms involved in vision, the rainbow, and color.||The second book of De Anima gives Aristotle's theory of sense perceptions. Vision has a sense-organ: the eye. Vision has a medium: air or water. Vision has its proper object: color--which for Aristotle is an object's sensible quality. Perception is the reception of a perceptible form, resulting in an alteration in the mental faculty. it is here that Aristotle gives his famous wax analogy: '. . . each sense receives the perceptible forms without the matter. Wax, for instance, receives the design on a signet ring without the iron or gold; it acquires the design in the gold or bronze, but not insofar as the design is gold or bronze.' The passing of a perceptible form from object to eye involves Aristotle's theory of light. If the medium between object and eye is potentially transparent, then in the presence of light, vision can take place because light turn potential transparency to actually transparency and perceptible forms can move from object to eye. Thus, the things necessary for vision are: the eye, an object to be viewed, a potentially transparent medium separating object and eye, and light to change the medium's transparency from potential to actual. The nature of light and the notion of objects radiating perceptible forms were topics that received considerable attention from Aristotelian commentators in late Antiquity and early Medieval times.||Aristotle theory of the rainbow is stated in book three of <i>De Meteorologicorum<i>. The phenomenon is caused by sunlight reflecting off raindrops in a cloud. The <i>Problemata<i> pose questions, each stemming from a single observation of an everyday phenomena. Many deal with the eye, optics, and vision: Book XV, Problem 6:  Why is it the case that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular? Book XV, Problem 11: Why is it the case that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? These problems show the ancient origin of the problem of describing how pin-hole images were formed. Problem 13 Book XVI contains Aristotle's presentation of the mechanical analogy of reflection when describing a mirror image. There are also problems related to visual perception","Casaubon's Aristotle|Glucker, J.|<i>Classica et Mediaevalis<i>, Vol 26, 1964, pp 274-296.||The Aristotelian Explanation of the Rainbow|Sayili, A.M.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 30, No 1, 1939, pp 65-83.||Sight and the philosophy of vision in Classical Greece: Democritus, Plato and Aristotle|Nightingale, A.|In: <i>Sight and the Ancient Senses<i>, Squire, M., editor|Routledge, 2016, 336 pp, NB: pp 54-68.||Aristotle and the Renaissance|Schmitt, C.B.|Harvard University Press, 1983, 187 pp, NB: pp 36-40, 83-86.||The Rise of the Philosophical Textbook|Schmitt, C.

"John Pecham, OFM","Pecham, John OFM",John Pecham,c1230-1292,Translated by Giovanni Paolo Gallucci (1538 - 1621) Italian astronomer and translator.,Perspettiva commune,"Gallucci's Italian translation and commentary of Hartmann's 1542 edition of Peckham‚Äôs optics textbook, with new figures.","Giovanni Paolo Gallucci's Italian translation and commentary of Hartmann's 1542 edition of Peckham's optics textbook, <i>Perspectiva Communis<i>. This is one of several translations Gallucci produced (he is famed for his <i>Margarita Filosfica<i>, an Italian translation of Reisch's encyclopedia) and is the last printing of the <i>Perspectiva Communis<i> to appear before Johannes Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604. In his prefatory dedication to the apostolic secretary Giovanni Battista Cucina, Gallucci praises the value of Peckham's book: 'we must be grateful to those who offer us instruments to help us discern the true from the false, as the author of this manual that communicates to us in a clear and exhaustive manner every rule concerning perfect vision.' Gallucci‚Äôs vernacular translation made Peckham's work available to a broader audience. Gallucci‚Äôs glosses feature examples taken from everyday life. For instance, <i>‚ÄòPropositio IX‚Äô<i> illustrates why a fire appears bigger at night, and bigger from afar, when one cannot distinguish the individual flames. Gallucci compares this to what happens in church to a short-sighted person who looks at the many lit candles: without his spectacles on, the candles will appear like they are big, and touching one another; with his spectacles on, the individual flames will be discernible and the candles smaller. The long section on mirrors discusses the reflection of colors, the angles of incidence, transparency, the function of lead on glass mirrors, mirrors made of iron or diamond, spherical or plain or shaped like a column, and the appearance of images on broken mirrors.

Giambattista della Porta,"Porta, Giambattista della",Giovanni Battista Della Porta,c1535-1615," ",De refractione,"An analysis of refraction in spheres and its application to concave and convex lenses. Important advances in the use of geometric diagrams in optics. Also considers various theories of vision.
","Giambattista Della Porta's <i>De Refractione<i> has its beginnings in his earlier work, the second edition of the Magia Naturalis of 1589. An early version of the <i>De Refractione<i> must already have been underway, if not completed, since he mentions it several times in the Magia Naturalis. In the nearly 30 years that separated the first and second editions of the Magia, Della Porta's understanding of optics and his knowledge of existing works on the subject had grown; he cites earlier works liberally in <i>De Refractione<i>, mentioning Aristotle, Euclid, Galen, Ptolemy, Alhazen, Avicenna, Averroes, Bacon, Witelo, Peckham, and many others. And his manner of presentation changed considerably. The optical part of the Magia was a collection of descriptions of optical effects with only faint attempts at explanation, the <i>De Refractione<i> was based on geometry, with definitions, postulates, theorems, and proofs. His preface makes clear why he (re)wrote <i>De Refractione<i>:  'The circumstance which impelled us to write <i>De Refractione<i> was that we might see the matter covered briefly by our ancestors and become a more  satisfying treatise, so that rather than traces, the foundations of the art could be seen.'|<i>De Refractione<i> is important as a bridge between medieval Perspectiva and the imagining by dioptrics established by Johannes Kepler in 1604. As a prelude to his analysis of refraction in spheres, Della Porta undertakes an extensive analysis of spherical mirrors and this is perhaps the most important advance in <i>De Refractione<i>. It is also witness to the change in optics in the 16th century: a new interest in and insistence upon the use of experiments and observation of nature, and the need and value of constructing geometric models of natural phenomena. Though Della Porta reports many observations, ultimately, he was unable to construct a sufficiently encompassing geometric framework that would have led to a successful treatment of lenses. But even with that, De Refractione had considerable influence, if only because of its introduction of the camera obscura as a model for the eye and the acknowledged starting point this provide for Johannes Kepler.
","<i>De Refractione<i> is in nine books. 1: Refraction of light and vision at the interface of two media. 2: Refraction in the glass sphere. 3: Structure of the eye. 4: Vision as penetration of direct and refracted rays into the eye. 5: Perspective vision. 6: binocular vision. 7: Various issues from the optics, physiology and psychology of vision. 8: Spherical lenses. 9: Various issues on refraction including the rainbow, meteorological phenomena and so on.||De Refractione can be divided into three parts: books 1-2 develop a theory of refraction in spheres (64 pages), books 3-7 analyze the eye and a theory of vision (93 pages), books 8-9 give a  theory of lenses and their application (72 pages).||The work begins with a review of optical basics in the form of propositions and a description of Della Porta's instrument for measuring angles of refraction. His tables of values reveal that he must have actually built and used this device. The basic propositions are used to explain well-known phenomena, some explanations are successful (objects appearing bent when partially submerged in water, atmospheric refraction changing stellar positions), some are not (the position of fully submerged objects).  Before considering spherical refraction, Della Porta considers reflection in concave spherical mirrors and the images it produces; desiring to produce principles valid for refraction and spherical surfaces. The analysis of spherical mirrors is the most successful part of <i>De Refractione<i> and introduced the notion of the 'inversion point' (where reflected/refracted rays cross) as a method of image analysis. The porting of principles of spherical reflection to spherical refraction was erroneous and blinkered most of the later developments in De Refractione. Spherical refraction is applied to the analysis of the eye and the mechanism of vision, combining refraction with traditional ideas involving the visual pyramid and it composite rays and the crystalline humor as the seat of vision. It is here that Della Porta makes his observation that the pupil acts like the aperture in a camera obscura, creating an image that falls on the front surface of the crystalline. Della Porta's consideration of vision includes his somewhat confused theory of vision, including binocular vision. The last part of De Refractione attempts to apply the theory of the refractive sphere and the inversion point to convex and concave lenses and, unhappily, exhibits many instances of an ingenious carelessness on Della Porta's part, with even simple cases of refraction wrongly constructed. Geometry was used more as analogy than a demonstrative tool.

Giambattista della Porta,"Porta, Giambattista della",Giovanni Battista Della Porta,c1535-1615," ",Magi√¶ Naturalis Libri Viginti,"Natural Magic is presented as the practical part of natural philosophy; that is, instruments, practice, and effects. Vison, mirrors and lenses are considered in the optics section.
","Giambattista Della Porta's <i>Magiae Naturalis Libri Viginti<i> was a significant expansion of his early book on natural magic of 1558. For Della Porta, Natural Magic was the practical part of natural philosophy and focused on exceptional, unusual, extraordinary phenomena, rather than the quotidian. It was the recognition and mastering of natural phenomena, in particular, those phenomena that had to be sought out, phenomena that were otherwise hidden. The point was not to explain the phenomena, but to be able to (re)produce it, display it, describe it and thus reveal nature's secrets. The author and the book changed considerably in the nearly thirty years that separated the first and second editions. Della Porta had mastered a large portion of classical humanist studies by 1589, including the medieval encyclopedias of secrets. From the latter, the scope of the book expanded considerably, and Della Porta established a long list of secrets which the second edition of the <i>Magiae Naturalis<i> was to 'reduce all those secrets into their  proper places.' The second edition is also considerably more experimental in the sense of the direct manipulation of nature. But one aspect of the book and its author did not change: the notion that explaining natural phenomena and unlocking the secrets of nature are fundamentally esoteric activities. Alchemy and Optics are significant portions of the Magiae Naturalis of 1589.|<i>The Magiae Naturalis Libri Viginti<i> established Della Porta's reputation as Europe's leading authority on natural magic. The book was tremendously popular and commercially successful; Antwerp's Pantin Press and Frankfurt's Wechel press were among dell Porta's publishers. Printings of the second Latin edition appeared in 1589, 1591, 1592, 1597, 1600, 1607, 1619, 1644, 1650, 1651, and 1664. An Italian translation appeared in 1611, a German translation appeared at Magdeburg in 1612 and 1617, French translations appeared at Lyon in 1615 and at Rouen in 1657, an English translation appeared at London in 1658 and 1659.
","Giambattista Della Porta presents natural magic as the practical part of natural philosophy; that is, instruments, practice, and effects. There are 20 books: 1: Of the Causes of Wonderful things, 2: Of the Generation of Animals. 3:Of the Production of New Plants. 4: Of increasing Household Stuff. 5: Of changing Metals. 6: Of counterfeiting Gold. 7: Of the Wonders of the Loadstone. 8: Of strange Cures. 9: Of Beautifying Women. 10: Of Distillation.11: Of Perfuming. 12: Of Artificial Fires. 13: Of Tempering Steel. 14: Of Cookery. 15: Of Fishing, Fowling, Hunting, etc. 16: Of Invisible Writing. 17: Of Catoptric Images. 18: Of Statick Experiments. 19: Pneumatic Experiments. 20: Of the Chaos.  Of all the material covered, that considered in book 17 on vison, mirrors and lenses, is probably the most important, it was certainly that with the most extensive and lasting effect. It contains 23 topics: Plane mirrors; Plane mirror illusions; Mirrors for display and the theater; Concave mirrors; Plane and concave mirrors together; Other operations with concave mirrors; How to see in the dark, that which is illuminated by torches; How without a mirror or other device an image can hand in the air; Mixtures of mirrors and their images; The Crystalline Lens and its effects; Lenses for seeing far beyond what can be imagined; Camera obscura; Crystal prism; Burning mirrors; Parabolic burning mirrors and their construction; Parabolic section construction; Parabolic section for burning at infinite distances; Burning glass from spherical sections; Kindling fire more forcefully with refraction; Image outside a concave mirror; Making mirrors; Making plane, convex, and concave mirrors with applied and bonded foil; Making metallic mirrors.||Della Porta is not interested in explaining optical phenomena--he refers the reader to Archimedes, Euclid, Ptolemy, and Witelo--nor does he aim to discern and study the laws of optics to explain the effects. Rather, he seeks to demonstrate and show how it is possible to increase the effect of optical phenomena. The most influential topics are the camera obscura and lenses. Della Porta had added a mirror to the camera obscura to right the image, but by 1589 he places a lens in the aperture to clarify and amplify the image, and more importantly, to make the first suggestion that the eye is like a camera obscura. Concave mirrors are discussed and their numerous images presented in considerable detail. It is in connection with mirror images that Della Porta introduces the point of inversion (where rays cross, the focus) and the use of the cathetus to predict image location.","Knowing by doing in sixteenth-century natural magic: Giambattista della Porta and the wonders of nature|Saito, F.|<i>Circumscribere<i>, Vo1 14, 2014, pp 17-39||<i>Science and the Secretes of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture<i>|Eamon, W.|Princeton University Press, 1994, 490 pp, NB: pp 210-233.||<i>The Optics of Giambattista della Porta(ca. 1535‚Äì1615): A Reassessment<i>|Borrelli, A., Hon, G., Zik, Y., editors|Springer, 2017, 205 pp, NB: pp 184-188.","Io.

The substantial additions comprise instructions on arithmetic and music.","A reprinting with a new date on the title page of Giovanni Paolo Gallucci's Italian translation of 1599 of Reisch's early Renaissance work the <i>Margarita Philosophica<i> of 1503. Though often called the first modern encyclopedia to appear in print, it is, rather, an epitome, a compendium, a textbook, written for students. It was the first printed text in widespread use that presented the disciplines in a university course of study--a distillation of most of Aristotelian philosophy. The book was meant to be read through; it gives a threaded, contiguous presentation and not a collection of isolated articles for dipping into. The Philosophical Pearl is patterned after the curriculum of the University of Freiburg, where Reisch had studied. He collected the specified texts, from them generated an accessible dialogue format, and added the complete array of trivium and quadrivium subjects. Though no evidence exists that it was actually prescribed, Reisch's Philosophical Pearl was used at universities throughout Europe. Andreas Vesalius records reading its anatomy section while at student at Louvain--and he was not impressed. Of particular importance are books 8-11 which deal with natural philosophy.|The Italian translation has (with the exception of books 8-11) considerably fewer illustrations than the earliest Latin editions, but it has additions by Oronce Fin√© and an introduction by Faber Stapulensis to the arithmetic of Boethius and Jordanus. The substantial additions include: Latin Grammar, Arithmetic, Music, Squaring the circle, Architecture, Sundials, Astrolabe construction, Mirrors, the Torquetum, Cosmography, and Perspective. These additions are half as large as the original work, added significant and detailed modern material to Reisch's content, and undoubtedly increased the book's instructional value.|Editions of the Latin text appeared in 1503, 1504, 1504, 1508, 1508, 1512, 1515, 1517, 1535, 1583. The augmented Italian translation appeared at Venice in 1599 and 1600.

","10th edition of Clavius's commentaries on Sacrobosco's <i>De Sphaera Numdi<i>.  This, the principal astronomical work of Clavius, was his commentary on the <i>Tractatus de sphaera<i>  written by the Englishman Johannes Sacrobosco (John Holywood),  professor in Paris in the thirteenth century. Sacrobosco  presented a simplified version of the second century Alexandrian astronomy of Ptolemy which gained wide popularity, attracted numerious commentators and glosses, and became the most-used astronomy textbook throughout the Middle Ages.||First published in 1570, this is the penultimate edition of Clavius's commentary on Sacrobosco and the last to appear before Galileo's <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> in 1610. The differences between this edition and the next are small but striking. Clavius would edit the work once more, just after the <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> appeared, and in it felt compelled to express some flexibility about the rigid adherence to Ptolemy and Aristotle. in the last edition of 1611, Clavius mentions discoveries such as those of the novae stars seen in 1570, 1600 and 1604 and also the comet of 1577 among others by Tycho Brahe; all indicating that, contrary to the Aristotelian doctrine, the celestial spheres were not incorruptible. Clavius acknowledges that Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus and the satellites of Jupiter showed that not everything was in orbit around the Earth and that the celestial orbits needed to be 'reformed'. ","Clavius sets out his view of then-contemporary astronomy, with his commentaries being far more extensive than the original text of Sacrobosco. Clavius presents a geocentric Ptolemaic astronomy, with the physically-real celestial spheres: seven for the five planets, the Sun and the Moon, one for the fixed stars,  three more to explain certain motions of the stars, and finally the sphere of the empyrean heaven. All with with Ptolemaic eccentrics and epicycles, centered on the Earth at the center of the universe. All allowing an accord with both the physics of Aristotle and a literal interpretation of the Bible.||In the edition of 1581 and repeated here, Clavius pays acknowledges the astronomical work of Copernicus, whom he calls 'the outstanding renovator of astronomy in our times whom posterity will celebrate and admire like a second Ptolemy.'  Nevertheless, though he recognized the great value of Copernicus as a source of observations, tables and calculations, he considered the theory of Ptolemy preferable to what he called the 'inventions' of Copernicus. Writing that many observations and the common opinion of philosophers disprove the heliocentric system, presents many observations and phenomena which prove that the Earth is at the center of the universe; the most important arguments were from Aristotelian physics.","Doctrine of the Sphere, In: <i>The Sun in the Church<i>|Heilbron J.L.|Harvard Universtiy Press, Cambridge, 1999 pp 51-62||The Tracts on the Sphere, In: <i>The Structures of Practical Knowledge<i>|Valleriani, M.|Springer, 2017, PP 421-474||Clavius and Mathematics in the <i>Collegio Romano<i>|Ud√≠as, A.|In: Jesuit Contribution to Science, Springer, 2015, pp 1-22.",In sphaeram Joannis de Sacro Bosco commentarius,Commentary on 'The Sphere' of John of Holywood.,Latin,1601,1600-1625,"German Jesuit teacher at the Collegio Romano, author of important texts in mathematics and astronomy.",10,1570,"Owner's signature on title page.

First edition, second issue, this is the text that Kepler studied for ocular anatomy. First use of etchings for medical illustration.","Felix Platter published <i>De Corporis Humani Structura et Usu Libri III<i> when he was nearly fifty; producing an anatomy for medical students that benefited from his own 30-year medical and teaching career, and the pioneering anatomical work of Andreas Vesalius. Platter was the first Vesalian anatomist in Germany and the first physician in that country to dissect a human body--performing hundreds of dissections in his lifetime. The  <i>De Corporis Humani Structura et Usu Libri III<i> copied much Vesalian material and was one of the principal books that spread Vesalian anatomy to European medical centers. The book's format is highly structured and presented in a format that made student use easy; lists of anatomical parts are grouped in a series of schemas.|First edition, second issue, this is the text that Kepler studied for ocular anatomy, and the first use of etchings for medical illustration. Editions appeared in 1583 and 1603, the latter being a reissue of the 1583 text with new printing of the first quire of preliminary material. Platter's text deeply influenced Johannes Kepler and his analysis of ocular optics.
","Felix Platter in his <i>De Corporis Humani Structura et Usu Libri III<i>  of 1583 produced a Vesalian anatomy book specifically for medical students. The work is in three books: Book I The structure and use of the simple parts of the human body including bones, muscles, blood vessels, ligaments, skin, and fat; Book II The structure and use of the composite parts of the human body including membranes, stomach, thorax, head, arm, and leg; Book III Explanation of parts of the human body delineated by pictures. The first two Books present anatomical parts of the body arranged in in a series of elaborate schemas of text and layers of grouping brackets to show structure, hierarchy, and relationship. Book III includes the 50 plates with the relevant text on the facing page of the preceding leaf, an innovation of the De Corporis Humani Structura et Usu Libri III. Though Platter plagiarized much of Vesalius's anatomy (as did many others), the copying was not slavish. Book III contains the first printed illustration of a female skeleton and the more famous child skeleton.||Platter also corrected several aspects of Galenic-Vesalian ocular anatomy with, for example, Platter's drawing of eye showing the crystalline lens closer to the front of the eye, reflecting more recent and accurate information. He also noted the differences in curvature of the front and back of the lens. Importantly, Platter stated that the lens functioned only to form an image on the retina and reiterated the opinion introduced four centuries earlier by Ibn Rushd that the retina, not the crystalline lens, is the seat of vision.","The Eye of Vesalius|De Laey, J.J.|<i>Acta Ophthalmologica<i>, Vol 89, pp 293-300.|The Great Anatomical Atlases|Thomas, K.B.|<i>Proceeding of the Royal Society of Medicine<i>, Vol 67, 1974, pp 223-232.",De corporis humani structura et usu Libri III,Three Books on the Structure and Function of the Human Body.,Latin,1603,1600-1625,"Swiss physician, anatomist, and professor in Basel.

Euclid,Euclid,Euclid of Alexandria,c295 BC,"Translated by Jean Pena (1528 - 1558) French educational reformer and student of Peter Ramus, famous for the preface written for this text: <i>De usu optices praefatio<i>, Preface on the use of optics.",Optica et Catoptrica,"Second edition of Pena's Latin translation from the Greek of Euclid's geometrical optics of lenses and mirrors that first appeared in 1557. Includes the influential preface The Use of Optics.","Second edition of Jean Pena's Latin translation from the Greek of Euclid's <i>Optica<i> and the <i>Catoptrica<i> was prompted by his poor assessment of the commonly available translations. He was referring either to the text that appears in Georgius Valla's  <i>De Expetendis et Fugiendis Rebus Opus<i> in 1501 or to the translation of Bartolomeo Zamberti. In his preface, Pena agrees with the assessment of Francesco Maurolyco that earlier translators had insufficient knowledge of <i>Perspectiva<i>. Pena also notes that some theorems and many of the scholia are missing and that some demonstrations accompanied the wrong theorem. Pena sought to completely and accurately present the whole of the optical and vision teaching of Euclid, in part as a balance to what he considered the uncritical acceptance of Witelo and Peckham common at that time. Pena presents the Euclidian work on the geometrical optics of vision and mirrors and even more influentially, includes the preface The Use of Optics.||Editions appeared in 1557 and 1604.
","Pena prefaces his Greek and Latin text with an assessment of some of the teachings of Witelo and Peckham that he considered erroneous. He argued that though both authors were great scholars, nothing should be accepted until experimentally demonstrated. Pena rejects Witelo's accounting (coming from Alhazen's De Aspectibus) of the intromission theory of vision, supporting the Euclidian idea of rays emanating from the eye. Pena also criticized Peckham's account of the Milky Way light reflected from sun and stars. In Pena's text, there are 61 theorems in the <i>Optica<i> and 31 in the <i>Catoptrica<i>. The Greek and Latin texts are given side-by-side. The book also contains Pena long introductory essay 'On the use of Optics', in which he sets out his ideas on astronomy and cosmology, supporting them by optical arguments. According to Pena, the matter of the heavens was not Aristotelian ether but air. In the essay, Pena detailed how optical theory spoke against a heavenly ether and the celestial spheres that moved the planets and stars.","Liber de visu : The Greco-Latin Translation of Euclid's Optics|Theisen, W.R.|<i>Mediaeval Studies<i>, Vol 41, 1979, pp 44-105.||ùëª The Optics of Euclid|Burton, H.E., translator|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i>, Vol 46, No 5, 1945, pp 357-372.||ùëª <i>The medieval Latin traditions of Euclid's Catoptrica: A Critical Edition of De speculis with an Introduction, English Translation, and Commentary<i>|Takahashi, K.|Kyushu University Press, 1992, 373 pp.||<i>From Sight to Light<i>|Smith, A.M.|University of Chicago Press, 2015, 457 pp, NB: pp 47-64.||Jean Pean (1528-58) and Stoic Physics in the Sixteenth Century|Barker, P.|<i>The Southern Journal of Philosophy<i>, 1985, Vol XXIII, Supplement||<i>Change and Continuity in Early Modern Cosmology<i>|Boner, P.J., editor|Spring, 2011, 181 pp, NB: pp 40-48.||The Challenge of Applied Optics|In: <i>The Unmaking of the Medieval Christian Cosmos, 1500‚Äì1760<i>|Randles, W.G.L.|Routledge, 2016, 295 pp.||Atmospheric Refraction and the Ramus Circle: Aspects of a Late Sixteenth-Century Dispute|Peoux, G.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 67, No4 , 2010, pp 457-484.||Peripatetic and Euclidean theories of the visual ray|Jones, A.|<i>Physis<i>, Vol 31, No 1, 1994, pp 47-76.","Euclidis Optica et Catoptrica e Graeco versa Per Ioan.

Johannes Kepler,"Kepler, Johannes",,1571-1630," ",Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena,"Establishes the beginning of modern optics. Contains advances in the nature of light, images from pin -holes, mirrors and lenses, and the optics of the eye. ","The origin of Johannes Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> is the solar eclipse of 10 July 1600. Tycho Brahe had previously described the errors using a camera obscura to determine sun and moon sizes and so Kepler, hoping to find their cause, recorded the instrument's aperture size, screen distance, image size--just has Brahe had done--along with other eclipse data. He recorded all his observations in an 'eclipse notebook.' In the following weeks Kepler studies optics, consulting Friedrich Risner's editions of the De Aspectibus of Alhacen and the <i>Perspectiva<i> of Witelo of 1572, the <i>De Corporis Humani Structura et Usu Libri III<i> of Platter of 1603, the <i>Anatomia Pragensis<i> of Johannes Jessen of 1601, and Della Porta's <i>Magia Naturalis<i> of 1589 and <i>De Refractione<i> of Della Porta of 1593. He then added two sets of numbered propositions to the eclipse notebook: 17 set out his theory of pin-hole image formation, and 14 listed problems to be solved. The eclipse notebook became a draft outline of the Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena. For three years Kepler divided his efforts between work on determining the orbit of Mars and turning his eclipse notebook into his optics book. The first five chapters are the paralipomena to Witelo, covering the nature of light, the eye, and vision. The final 6 chapters are the optical parts of astronomy, applying his optical developments to observations and instruments. Kepler had completed his manuscript by the end of 1603 and presented it to the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II, on New Year‚Äôs Day, 1604. Printing was completed in time for the book to appear at the autumn book fair of 1604.||Kepler's ocular anatomy came directly from Flex Platter's <i>De Corporis Humani Structura et Usu Libri III<i> of 1583/1603. Particularly import was Platter's size and placement of the lens and retina, and his idea that the retina was the seat of vision. Indeed, the images in the plate of ocular anatomy in the <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> are direct copies from Platter's work.||Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> produced four significant advances in optics: the nature of light, the formation of images from pin -holes (the camera obscura), the nature of images from mirrors and lenses, and the optics and function of the eye. The first and second arose from Kepler's dogged insistence on the rectilinear propagation of light. The third arose from careful and accurate application of geometry to reflection and refraction. The fourth arose from the first three and his study of ocular anatomy--and permanently established the camera obscura as the model of the eye. In this way, the <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> fissioned medieval Perspectiva into two sciences: that of light and that of vision. Though the influence of the <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> was  permanent and profound, if slow to develop. Early adopters of its physical optics included Ambrosius Rhode in his <i>Optica<i> of 1611, and of its theory of ocular optics included Vopiscus Plemp in his <i>Ophthalmographia<i> of 1632. The Jesuit Francois Aguil√≥n in his <i>Opticorum Libri Sex<i> of 1613 did not know of Kepler and held to the perspectivist idea of intromission of species.  But the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner in his <i>Oculus<i> of 1619 followed Kepler's optics and his ocular function.  And Ren√© Descartes would famously claim he learned optics from Kepler. <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> also affected astronomy; showing how to precisely determine changing sun and moon diameters and thus orbit eccentricities.
","The book is in two parts: Chapters 1-5 are the paralipomena to Witelo, and chapters 6-11 are the optical part of astronomy. 1: Nature of Light, 2: Shape of Light, 3: Catoptrics and Images, 4: Measure of Refraction, 5: Means of Vision, 6: Varied Lights of Stars, 7: Earth's Shadow, 8: Moon's Shadow, 9: Parallaxes, 10: Optics of Heavenly Bodies' Motions, 11: Observation of Sun and Moon Diameters and Eclipses. Chapter 1 presents the nature of light and its propagation. From his fixed principle of rectilinear propagation and the nature of reflection and refraction, Kepler lays out 38 propositions. Number 9 is the first enunciation of the inverse-square nature of illumination. Chapter 2 presents 12 propositions that solve the problem of images from pin-holes. He begins with an object sending rays of light through a vanishingly small hole; elegantly demonstrating how light 'paints' an image or 'picture' of the object on a screen. Larger apertures of any shape can be considered a collection of vanishingly small holes, and so explains how an object's image changes shape as the screen assumes different distances from the aperture and why  at great distances the 'picture' is that of the object and not the aperture. Importantly, larger apertures made for brighter sun and moon images, with more easily determined diameters that were less affected by diffraction. And apertures of any size could be accounted for in calculating image diameter. Chapter 3 presents 19 propositions that are careful, geometric considerations of reflection and the size and position of images produced. Kepler makes a distinction between the image formed by a curved mirror (Della Porta's floating images) and that projected onto a screen by pin-hole or a lens: 'imago' and 'pictura.' That is, what came to be called virtual and real images.  Chapter 4 describes the measurement of the angle of refraction and gives a table values to correct that of Witelo. Kepler struggles without success to obtain a general law relating the angles of incidence and refraction, settling for what he recognizes to be an approximation good for small angles. Chapter 5 presents Kepler's distillation of ocular anatomy and his work on refraction: his theory of the optical function of the eye. Kepler is unfamiliar with lenses, using instead a sphere to represent the crystalline humor. He traces rays through the sphere to show how a 'pictura' of an object is painted on the retina by rays coming from the object and are refracted by the crystalline humor. Kepler separates the crystalline humor and retina completely--only the retina is sensitive to light. Kepler goes no further that a 'pictura' painted on the retina, how visual perception arises from this inverted image he 'leaves to the philosophers.'","‚ÅÇ <i>Kepler's Optics: A Study in the Development of Seventeenth-century Natural Philosophy<i>|Straker, S.M.|Dissertation, Indiana University, 1970, 585 p.||ùëª <i>Optics: Paralipomena to Witelo & Optical Part of Astronomy<i>|Donahue, W.H., translator|Green Lion Press, Santa Fe, 2000||Expectation, Modelling and Assent in the History of Optics II: Kepler and Descartes|Crombie, A.C.|<i>Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science<i>, Vol 22, No. 1, 1992, pp 89-115.||Ptolemy, Alhazen, and Kepler and the Problem of Optical Images|Smith, A.M.|<i>Arabic Sciences and Philosophy<i>, Vol 8, No 1, 1998, pp 9-44.||Kepler‚Äôs Optical Part of Astronomy (1604): Introducing the Ecliptic Instrument|Hon, G., Zik, Y.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 17, No 3, 2009, pp 307-345.","Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena, quibus Astronomiae part Optica Traditur; Postissimum de artificiosa observatiosne et aestimatione diametroum deliquiorumque; Solis & Lunae.

Willebrord Snell famously annotated a copy.","Posthumous publication of a compendium of optics by Pierre de la Ram√©e and Friedrich Risner. Risner's library contained an unfinished manuscript of a book he and Pierre de la Ram√©e had begun previous to the publication of Risner's <i>Opticae Thesaurus<i> of 1572. The <i>Opticae Libri Quatuor<i> has a preface to the reader undoubtedly written by the editor and publisher, Nikolaus Krug, a teacher, mathematician, librarian, and school rector at Kassel. Krug notes that the text was the work of both Ramus and Risner: '... a common work, first begun and arranged by the promise and desire of the great Peter Ramus; Risner finished and corrected some parts, and only moved and formed others.' Ramus mentions the unfinished text in his will that funded a Professor of Mathematics at the Coll√®ge Royal. He nominated Risner for the position 'so that he will be able to finish the work on optics which we began by our common labors ...' Risner never finished the project and of the manuscript that Krug brought to the press, only the first book was in a complete state. Apparently, Risner contribution was limited to a few mathematical demonstrations and references to Alhacen and Witelo. Krug included a reprinting of Jean Pena's <i>De Usu Optices<i>, 'The Use of Optics.' as a preface to the four books of Ramus and Risner.||The <i>Opticae Libri Quatuor<i> summarizes the optics of Euclid and Aristotle, but particularly of Alhacen, and Witelo. It is the optics of the <i>Opticae Thesaurus<i> of 1572 with the details summarized or omitted and the mathematical demonstrations much reduced. It was, however abbreviated or incomplete, a useful summary of pre-Keplerian optics. Willebrord Snell considered it so and famously annotated a copy in the years 1611-1622.||Editions appeared in 1606 and 1615.
","The work contains the introduction 'De Usu Optices' from Jean Pena's <i>Euclidis Optica et Catoptrica<i> of 1557, and four books written by Ramus and emended by Risner. Book 1: On the Visible. Book 2: On Direct Vision. Book 3: On Vision Established by Reflection. Book 4: On Refracted Vision. Book 1 presents a medieval perspectivist account of light, color, and vision, mixed with Euclidian rays propagating in straight lines. Vision is the intromission of light and color species emitted by the visible object, made possible by the transparency of intervening medium which, in turn, is affected by light. Witelo's theory of images from pin-holes is given, along with a Euclidian account of light and shadow, and the Scholastic account of color as the mixing of light and dark, white and black. Book 2 is on direct vision and the intromission of species, including the cone of vision and various aspects of visual perception. These include color, size, shape, place, number, and motion. Book 3 is on reflection vision and covers basic reflection, true and false reflection (true images and illusions), plane and curved mirrors, convex and concave mirrors. Book 4 is on refracted vision and covers images from refraction, measurement of refraction, the rainbow, atmospheric refraction and meteorics. Book 1 is the longest and most complete, by far. The material is descriptive, with very little mathematics. Though there are extensive references to the <i>Opticae Thesaurus<i> of 1572, none of the elaborate material on the formation, placement, or size of images from mirrors is present.","Kepler‚Äôs optics without hypotheses|Dupr√©, S.|<i>Synthese<i>, Vol 185, 2012, pp 501‚Äì525.||Atmospheric Refraction and the Ramus Circle: Aspects of a Late Sixteenth-Century Dispute|Peoux, G.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 67, No4 , 2010, pp 457-484||Snellius' Notes on the Reflection and Refraction of Rays|Vollgraff, J.

The idea for the Execution of textbook of the Elements goes back at least as early as 1608.  In a letter to Johannes Kepler, Rhode wrote of his plan to publish the Euclid in ""short form"". He acknowledged the elaborate edition of the Jesuit Christoph Clavius, but  based on their difficulty, density, and the price due to its immense size, it was not a text accessible by the general student. Rhode hoped to present Euclid in a less dense, clearer, and less expensive form. But, fearing the judgments of others. he asked Kepler for council; and it seems that Kepler advised him to publish such a work. The result was a book is deeply informed by Rhode's experience in teaching mathematics.||Often bound with his <i>Optica<i> of 1611. This, the first edition of Rhode's Euclid, appeared in 1609, a corrected edition was published posthumously in 1634.

Marco Antonio de Dominis,"de Dominis, Marco Antonio",Marcantun¬†de Dominis¬†,1560-1624,"Edited by Giovanni Bartoli (?-?) Italian courtier, diplomat, antagonist of Galileo. Wrote the preface to this work.",De radiis visus et lucis,"Based on teaching notes and prompted by Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius, a brief exposition of three aspects of optics: Vision, lenses and the telescope, and the rainbow. ","Marco Antonio de Dominis was teaching mathematics at the universities of Padua and Brescia between 1588 and 1593. He had developed teaching notes which became the text of <i>De Radiis Visus et Lucis<i>. Though de Dominis had not been active in natural philosophy for 20 years, sometime before the text was printed, he added material on the telescope, having prompted by his friend Giovanni Bartoli and the general intellectual ferment created by Galileo's <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> of 1610. The date of this added material is uncertain, and it is unclear if de Dominis knew of Galileo's work or of Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> of 1611, since the imprimatur for the  preface of <i>De Radiis Visus et Lucis<i> is dated early in 1610 but its preface is dated late in 1611. Bartoli edited the text, wrote a preface, and was responsible for bringing the text to print. The preface describes the long path from composition to printing.||The material on optics and vision comes from Witelo and was entirely conventional. <i>De Radiis Visus et Lucis<i> was known for its theory of the rainbow and its claims to priority regarding the telescope. By using a glass sphere filled with water, de Dominis proposed and demonstrated that the rainbow was caused by reflection from the back of raindrops. On this basis, later writers would give de Dominis credit for explaining the rainbow; this included Isaac Newton. It is commonly held that, de Dominis (and subsequent others) did not know of Theodoric of Freiburg and his explanation of the rainbow early in the 14th century, even though Theodoric's full explanation appeared in print in Trutfetter's <i>Summa in totƒÅ physicen<i> of 1514.
","<i>De Radiis Visus et Lucis<i> has three principal parts: Basic mathematical and physical optics, Vision and the use of spectacles, Theory of the rainbow. Chapters 1-4 present the basic propositions of optics, basic aspects of reflection and refraction, and the consequences of rectilinear propagation. Convex and concave lenses are considered, but only to the extent of describing ray paths and convergence or divergence. This material lays the foundation for principal topics of the book: the operation of lenses and the function of the rainbow. Chapter 5-7 present the eye and vision and the use of lenses in spectacles to correct near and far-sightedness. de Dominis is unaware of any previous mathematical work on lenses, and his understanding comes from his own experiments. Chapters 8-9 are on the telescope. It is here that de Dominis makes his famous claim regarding the telescope: 'I am the first to break the ice.' Chapters 10-17 give de Dominis' theory of the rainbow. He starts with an historical review of rainbow theories from Aristotle's <i>De Meteorologica<i> to Renaissance writers, then considers <i>De Meteorologica's<i> commentators, and finally gives his own theory. This includes the rainbow's formation, shape, the cause of its colors, its angular size, and the cause of the secondary bow. The treatment is marked by an inconsistent use of de Dominis' own principles of refraction developed earlier in the book. This, confusion between the path of a single ray and that of ray bundles, and the poorly executed figures, contributes to the obscurity of the explanation. Chapter 18 is on other refractive atmospheric phenomena: coronae, parahelia, and others. Though supported by geometry, the material is generally descriptive and not analytic.","Marco Antonio de Dominis and His Explanation of the Rainbow|Ockenden, R.

Johannes Kepler,"Kepler, Johannes",,1571-1630," ",Dioptrice,"Prompted by Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius, the earliest complete analysis of dioptrics. Axioms, principles, and experimental results about the refraction of light are applied to lenses, explaining image formation, magnification and its measurement, image inversion, and the operation of the telescope.","Johannes Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> was a direct result of Galileo's <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i>. In March of 1610, Kepler had learned of Galileo‚Äôs discoveries from his friend Johannes Matthaeus Wacker von Wackenfels, and in April the ambassador from Tuscany, Giuliano de' Medici, provided Kepler with a copy of the <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> and asked him, via a letter from Galileo, to provide a response. The result was Kepler's <i>Dissertatio<i> of May 1610, praising Galileo and defending his claim to have discovered Jovian satellites and lunar mountains; sight unseen, as it were. In August and September 1610 Kepler verified Galileo's observations, using a telescope the Medici's had provide the Archbishop of Cologne, and described them in his Narratio of October 1610.|In his extensive preface to the <i>Dioptrice<i>, Kepler considers Pena's <i>Usu De Optices<i>, the preface to his translation of Euclid's <i>Optica<i>. Kepler also mentions the <i>Dissertatio<i>, recounts parts of the <i>Narratio<i>, and reproduces letters of Galileo regarding other observations included the phases of Venus. The text of <i>Dioptrice<i> is highly structured, containing: optical, visual, and physical axioms; definitions; problems, postulates, proposition; findings and notes. Kepler begins by considering refraction, measurement of refractive index, and planar refracting media. He then considers refraction at curved surfaces and lenses, making a complete study of the convex lens and the concave-convex lens combination. All this is finally used to describe the operation of the telescope. Here Kepler proposes a telescope using two convex lenses. The analysis is entirely in the context of vision and what is observed; lenses make objects appear larger, inverted, distinct. This is not the analytic geometrical optics of images that would appear 60 years later in Isaac Barrow's Lectiones Opticae of 1674.|The <i>Dioptrice<i> was understood, widely read, and exerted considerable influence until Isaac Barrow's time. The section on dioptrics of Pierre Herigone's <i>Cursus Mathematicus<i> of 1634 is a close paraphrase of the <i>Dioptrice<i>; acknowledged by Herigone in the 2nd edition. Pierre Gassendi repeatedly reprinted the <i>Dioptrice<i>. Johannes Hevelius‚Äô Selenographia of 1647 cites Kepler as an authority on lenses. Schyrleus de Rheita's Oculus Enoch et Eliae of 1645 cites the <i>Dioptrice<i>. In Carlo Antonio Manzini‚Äôs <i>L‚ÄôOcchiale all‚ÄôOcchio<i> of 1660, Kepler is frequently cited. Cherubin d‚ÄôOrleans‚Äô <i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> of 1671 shows extensive influence of the <i>Dioptrice<i>, including using Kepler approximate law of refraction. He calls himself Kepler's follower and names Kepler the principal author of modern dioptrics.|<i>Dioptrice<i> appeared at Prague in 1611, was reprinted by Gassendi in at Paris in 1647, at London in 1653 and 1683, and at Amsterdam in 1682. 
","Johannes Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> is in 141 numbered sections. They are variously labeled Definition, Axiom, Optical Axiom, Perceptual Axiom, Problem, Proposition, or Notes. There are several sections, each building upon material in previous sections.  1: Refraction at plane surfaces. 2: Light.  3: The lens. 4: Convergence point of a lens.  5: Action of both lens surfaces. 6: The effect of a convex lens by itself. 7: The lens of eye and vision. 8: The use of the lens with respect to the eye. 9: Convex lenses acting together. 10: Concave lenses. 11: Convex and concave lenses acting together. 12: Simple lensed instruments. 13: 'Criptical' lensed instruments.||Sections 1-5 are physical, treating light, glass, and refraction. It begins with Kepler's device for measuring refractive power. It is an idea and image that will appear is optics texts for 150 years, encompassing as it does a demonstration of refraction and means for its measure. Kepler states his approximate law of refraction here: for incidence angles less than 30‚Å∞, the refracted angle is ‚Öî the incidence angle. He establishes convergence points for convex lenses and relates their position to the radius of curvature of the lens, but does not generate any general analytical method for imaging. Sections 6-7 are devoted to the formation of images at the convergence points of convex lenses. Sections 8 deals with how lenses modify vision. The basis is the convergence of rays at the eye, however they may have been modified by lenses after they were emitted by an object. Magnification, minification, and inversion are all treated by assessing the visual angle of rays at the eye; lager angle gives magnification, small angle gives minification. Using this, Kepler explains how a single convex lens can magnify, minify, and invert an object as seen by the eye. It is here that Kepler recognizes spherical aberration. Sections 9-12 describe the operation of the Keplerian telescope and, in Propositions 107-115, the Galilean telescope; that being the highlight and Kepler's goal for the entire work. The last section deals with instruments with various forms of lenses, including menisci.","‚ÅÇKepler and the Telescope|Malet, A.|<i>Annales of Science<i>, Vol 60, 2003, pp 107-136.||Kepler's legacy: Telescopes and geometrical optics, 1611-1669|Malet, A.|In: <i>The Origins of the Telescope<i>, KNAW Press, Amsterdam, 2010, pp 281-300.",Dioptrice seu Demonstratio eorum quae visui & visbilibus propter Conspicilla non ita pridem inventa accidunt.,"Dioptrics, or, A Demonstation of those things that happen to vision and visibles because of the Conspicilla invented not long ago.",,1611,1600-1625,"German mathematician, astronomer, astrologer.

"Francesco Maurolyco, OSB","Maurolyco, Francesco OSB",Maurolico,1494-1575,"Edited by Chrosopher Clavius (1538-1612) German Jesuit teacher at the Collegio Romano, author of important texts in mathematics and astronomy.",Photismi de lumine,"Spartan march of propositions and proofs coving general optics, with commentary and editing by Clavius. Contains the earliest explanation of the operation of the pin-hole camera.","Francesco Maurolyco finished his <i>Photismi de Lumine et Umbra<i> in October of 1521 and the first two books of his <i>Diaphaneon<i> in January of 1522.  In 1554 he added a third book on vision to the <i>Diaphaneon<i> and by the end of 1567 had completed the entire work. Though these manuscripts circulated in a limited way for 50 years after they were written, they became widely known after the Jesuit Christopher Clavus from the Collegium Romano visited Maurolyco at Messina in 1574. Clavius was entrusted with the manuscripts of these and other works, in the hope of their being printed at Rome. Optics had gradually become more important at the Collegium Romanum by the end of the 16th century. Though Clavius would edit the <i>Photismi<i> and the <i>Diaphaneon<i>, the midwife of the Naples printing of 1611 was the Naples Jesuit Giovanni Giacomo Staserio. It was Staserio who convinced Clavius of the value and need for Maurolyco's optics work and it was Staserio who found a nobleman in Genoa to pay for the printing--Giovanni Battista Airolo, the dedicatee. The book appeared not long after Kepler's Ad Vitellionem of 1604 and Galileo's <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> of 1609 when optics assumed a critical part of natural philosophy throughout Europe.|Maurolyco fashioned his texts after the Euclidian model: a Spartan march of propositions, proofs, and demonstrations. They present the earliest explanation of the operation of the pin-hole camera, a theory of vision, a consideration of spectacles for correcting vision, and an explanation of the rainbow--albeit faulty. Maurolyco was the greatest mathematician to work in optics between Ibn al-Haytham in 950 and Johannes Kepler in 1604. He was the first to systematically consider illumination, dealt successfully with penumbral shadow, solved the problem of radiation through small apertures and images from pin-holes, attacked the problem of the rainbow, was the first to explore the geometry of radiation through thin lenses and so gained an understanding of visual theory that pointed to the cause and cure of near and far-sightedness. His extensive work in mathematics allowed him to bring a sophistication to optics beyond that of medieval times and bring a Euclidian clarity of structure to its presentation and demonstration. The <i>Photismi<i>||Editions appeared at Naples in 1611 and, with a slightly changed title, at Lyon in 1613. 
"," Francesco Maurolyco's <i>Photismi de Lumine et Umbra<i> has three topics: Illumination, pin-hole images, and reflections in curved mirrors. The work begins with four definitions and 6 postulates. From these foundations on the rectilinear propagation of light, Maurolyco develops 35 theorems. Theorems 1-21 deal with illumination, shadows, and penumbral shadows. Theorems 22-24 deal with images from small apertures. Theorems 25-35 deal with reflection and curved mirrors. Though theorems 1-21 are geometrically analytic, they are not quantitative so it would be inaccurate to describe them as dealing with photometry. However, they do consider the basic aspects of illumination and the projection of shadows in a qualitative way. Images from small apertures is analyzed using facing pyramids, bases formed by object and image and each apex coincident at point over the aperture. With an analysis of the angles involved, Maurolyco explains how the shape of the image changes with the distance from the aperture. The material on mirrors is entirely traditional, covering convex and concave mirrors, image inversion and burning mirrors.||The <i>Diaphaneon<i> is in three books. Book 1: On refraction. Book 2: On the Rainbow. Book 3: On the Eye and Vision. Book 1 begins with four postulates and presents 24 theorems on refraction and refracted images. This includes images displaced by refraction a plane interfaces, an approximate law of refraction, and ray paths in glass spheres. Book 2 is an unsuccessful attempt to analyze the rainbow based on reflection with a single raindrop. Book 3 is on the structure of the eye and the use of lenses to correct vision. The ocular anatomy is from Vesalius and the rest is traditional perspectivist vision with the crystalline humor as the seat of vision. In this context, Maurolyco investigates the convergence and divergence of rays in concave and convex lenses and, appealing to the requirement for ray symmetry on either side of the crystalline (with its assumed symmetrical lenticular shape), assumes that divergent light entering the crystalline, produced symmetric convergence exiting the crystalline and onto the optic nerve. He then reasoned that if the crystalline were wrongly shaped far or near-sightedness could occur, which could be correct by spectacles.||The commentary and editing by Clavius is particularly important in the Photismi, with evidence of changes and cancels made during the press run. In his letter to the reader, the printer makes clear that Clavius' additions, comments, and corrections have been set in italics.","‚ÅÇ Optics in Sixteenth-century Italy|Lindberg, D.|In: <i>Proceedings; Novita Celesti e Crisi del Sapere, Atti del Convegno Inernzionale de Studi Galileiani<i>, Istituto e Museo de Storia della Scienze, Florence, 1983, pp 131-148.||Francesco Maurolico, Giambattista della Porta and Their Theories on Refraction|Bell√©, Riccardo|In: <i>The Optics of Giambattista della Porta(ca. 1535‚Äì1615): A Reassessment<i>|Borrelli, A., Hon, G., Zik, Y., editors|Springer, 2017, 205 pp, NB: pp 172-184.||I Gesuiti e la pubblicazione dell'ottica di Francesco Maurolico|Bell√®, R.|<i>Bollettino di storia delle scienze matematiche<i>, Vol 26, 2006, pp 211-243||Geometry of Light and Shadow: Francesco Maurolyco (1494-1575) and the Pinhole Camera|Hon, G. and Zik, Y.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 64, No 4, 2007, pp 549-578.||Ptolomey, Alhazen, and Kepler and the Problem of Optical Images|Smith, A.M.|<i>Arabic Sciences and Philosophy<i>, Vol. 8, 1998, pp 9-44.||ùëª<i>The Photismi de lumine of Maurolycus : A Chapter in Late Medieval Optics<i>|Crew, H. translator|MacMillian, New York, 1940.||Bibliographic Analysis: <i>Edizione Nazionale dell'Opera matematica di Francesco Maurolico<i>|http://maurolico.elabor.biz/Maurolico/index.html","Abbatis Francisci Maurolyci Messanensis.

Ambrosius Rhode,"Rhode, Ambrosius",Rhodius,1577-1633," ",Optica (b),"Extensively illustrated contemporary textbook of theoretical and practical optics, closely following and promoting Johannes Kepler's optical work. Focused on the applications and utility of optics.","Ambrosius Rhode's textbook of theoretical and practical optics has its origin in the dissertation he defended in 1608, <i>Exercitationes Opticae<i>, at the University of Wittenberg where he taught. He soon presented a course in optics and developed notes, building on his <i>Exercitationes<i>, that form the basis for his optics textbook. Rhode's dedicatory letter makes clear the high value and utility he places on optics and the need for a contemporary textbook that avoids the prolixity and involved detail of many primary works. He writes that knowledge of optics and vision guides perception, advances physics and astronomy, and aides the practical arts of painting, architecture, and surveying. The preface is a relatively detailed history of optics, beginning with the Greeks and ending with Kepler and his <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604. It also serves to list the sources Rhode used which included Riser's edition of Alhacen and Witelo of 1574. The core of textbook is a very extensively illustrated introduction to optics, closely following and promoting Johannes Kepler's optical work, but following the structure of Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i>. It is clearly written by a skilled teacher with applications, problems, and detailed solutions with figures. Rhode's textbook is focused on the application and utility of optics; making no claims of innovation. It is was the cusp between perspectivist and Keplerian optics, and marked the beginning of new optical teaching in universities--containing, for example, the last direct reference to Ptolemy's optics until the late 18th century, but making no reference to the newly invented telescope.|The <i>Optica<i> is usually bound with Rhode's <i>Tractatus de Crepusculis<i> with a separate title page, as in the present copy.
","The work has a dedicatory letter on the value and utility of optics, a preface that gives the history of optics and Rhode's sources, and three books. Book 1: On direct vision. Book 2: On Mirrors. Book 3: On Refraction. Book 1 begins with 22 definitions and 21 'petitions' visual perception then 13 chapters. Chapter 1 Visibility in General, Chapter 2 On Light, Chapter 3 On Shadow and Darkness, Chapter 4 On Color, Chapter 5 On Transparency, Chapter 6 Structure of the Eye, Chapter 7 Direct Vision, Chapter 8 Perception of Light and Color, Chapter 8 (sic) Perception of Size, Chapter 10 Perception of Shape, Chapter 11 Perception of Location, Chapter 12 Perception of Number, Chapter 12 (sic) Perception of Motion. The material in chapters 2, 3, 6 and 7 follow Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> very closely. The others adhere to Witelo. Book 2 begins with 15 definitions involving reflection followed by 8 chapters. Chapter 1 Reflected Vision, Chapter 2 Specular Materials, Chapter 3 True mirrors, Chapter 4 Illusions from Mirrors, Chapter 5 Plane and Spherical Mirrors, Chapter 6 Convex Mirrors, Chapter 7, Concave Mirrors, Chapter 8 Burning Mirrors. The material on images from  mirrors follows Kepler, the sharp distinction between Kepler's 'pictura' and 'imago' is not made. Book 3 begins with 12 definitions involving refraction followed by two chapters. Chapter 1 Refracted Vision, Chapter 2 Mixed Reflection and Refraction. The material on refraction is very brief.||The <i>Tractatus de Crepusculis<i> presents Rhode's summary of traditional material on twilight.

"Francois d'  Aguil√≥n, SJ","Aguil√≥n, Francois d'  SJ",Franciscus Aguilonius,1567-1617," ",Opticorum Libri Sex,"A text for Jesuit schools, adhering to Aristotelian orthodoxy and covering: Light and vision, Colors, Binocular vision, Perception, Propagation of light, and Projections. Famously illustrated with etchings based on drawings by Rubens.
","Francois d' Aguil√≥n was teaching at the Jesuit school in Antwerp when he wrote his <i>Opticorum Libri Sex<i>. In his preface Aguil√≥n states that this is the first of three books on optics, intended to be followed by a second on catoptrics and a third on dioptrics. Only a few manuscript sections of a Catoptrica were produced. The <i>Opticorum<i> was written in 1609-1611 and the manuscript received the approval of the censor in December 1611. Widow Martina Moretus and her sons Balthazar and Jan issued it from the Plantin Press late in 1613. The growing number of Jesuit schools in Europe and the <i>Ratio Studiorum<i> of 1599 created a need for a text to support the teaching of optics. Aguil√≥n's book was an optics teaching manual for Jesuits. It covers only optics--that is, the nature of light, the eye, and vision by rays direct from an object. More than 50 authors are cited, the most frequent are Risner's edition of Alhacen's <i>De Aspectibus<i>, Witelo's <i>Perspectiva<i>, and John Peckham‚Äôs Perspectiva Communis. Importantly, Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604 and Pierre de la Ram√©e's <i>Opticae Libri Quatuor<i> of 1606  were unknow to Aguil√≥n. Though he adds interesting material on binocular vision, Aguil√≥n adheres closely to Scholastic optical teaching and so his <i>Opticorum Libri Sex<i> never becomes more than a guide for teaching late medieval optics. Aguil√≥n was a mathematician and though it covers only optics, his book is filled with detailed mathematical proofs and justifications; helpful for the tyro, tedious and pedantic for the initiated.||But unlike many other early texts, the <i>Opticorum Libri Sex<i> is also filled with descriptions of apparatus and demonstrations displaying for the reader many of the phenomena Aguil√≥n describes. Some of these are shown in the vignettes at the beginning of each book.The <i>Opticorum Libri Sex<i> is famed for these as well as its frontispiece, all drawn by Pieter Paul Rubens and engraved by Theodoor Galle.  The drawing of the  frontispiece is held by the British Museum, two vignette drawings by Washington‚Äôs National Gallery, and a third in the drawings collection of Marquis de Lagoy. The frontispiece is solemn and heavily freighted with allegory, but the vignettes are much more lively. One is at the head of each of the six books, depicting a philosopher, assisted by putti, engaged in an activity described in the book--which Rubens must have studied in order to have produced his drawings with their detail.|Though the <i>Opticorum Libri Sex<i> was used in Jesuit schools after its publication, it was rapidly overtaken by Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i>, Christoph Scheiner's <i>Oculus<i> of 1619, and Pierre de la Ram√©e's <i>Opticae Libri Quatuor<i>. Its awkward outdatedness is due in some measure to ahistorical hindsight, but not entirely; it puts into relief how rapidly optics was changing in the 17th century. However, its material on binocular vision and color theory continued to be referenced until the middle of the century.
","Francois d' Aguil√≥n's work has six books. 1: The Organ, Object, and Nature of Vision. The ocular anatomy of Vesalius is presented with the crystalline humor being the seat of vision, receiving species of shape and color emitted by an object and entering the eye. Aguil√≥n adheres to the Aristotelian idea of potential transparency actualized by light, and once transparent it could conduct species from object to eye. In this regard, he maintains the distinction between lux and lumen; intrinsic and transmitted light. Light and color are presented as the proper objects of vision, and here Aguil√≥n introduces his modification of Aristotle's color theory and presents a color diagram showing color relationships. 2: On Optical Rays and the Horopter. The cone of vision consists of optical rays propagating rectilinearly and here Aguil√≥n deals with binocular vision and two cones of vision and, famously, describes the Horopter: places in the field of vision where an object is seen singly, though viewed by both eyes. He considered the Horopter to be a plane passing through the binocular fixation point and perpendicular to the combined line-of-sight. 3: Common Objects of Cognition. Covers aspects of perception that had long been part of Perspectiva: Distance, quantity, shape, location, situation, continuity and discreteness, motion, and the conditions of such perceptions. 4: On the Fallacies of Vision. Based on the idea of the horopter, the perceptual mistakes that can be made are considered for: distance, size, situation, shapes (circle, squares, spheres, cylinders, and cones), location, number, motion, and light and shadow. 5: On Light and Dark. The first part deals with the nature of light; it's propagation and diminution as it does so. Aguil√≥n applies the Aristotelian idea of a 'minium naturale' to light. After being divided or extended beyond its 'minimum naturale', light intensity is extinguished. An experiment is presented to determine how light's power diminishes with propagation distance; the first recorded photometric experiment. This book also treats illumination and shadows, ending with a section on a pre-Keplarian consideration of the camera obscura. 6: On Projections. This book, the longest by far, encompasses nearly one-third of the entire work. It presents an elaborate, geometric consideration of projection, with particular emphasis on utility for architects, sculptors, scenographers, and painters.||The material in all six books has a Euclidian form, with definitions, propositions, proofs and conclusions. It is elaborately supported and demonstrated with geometry.","The Publication of the Opticorum Libri Sex|Ziggelaar, A.|<i>Strabismus<i>, Vol 20, No 1, 2012, pp 37-41||The Contents of the Opticorum Libri Sex|Ziggelaar, A.|<i>Strabismus<i>, Vol 20, No 2, 2012, pp 84-104||The Impact of the Opticorum Libri Sex|Ziggelaar, A.|<i>Strabismus<i>, Vol 20, No 3, 2012, pp 133-138||<i>The Quest for Perfect Vision<i>|Gallay, A.|Dissertation|University of Cambridge, 2013.||<i>Die Illustrationen von Peter Paul Rubens zum Lehrbuch der Optik des Franciscus Aguilonius/1613<i>|Jaeger, W.|Brausdruck GmbH, 1976, 58 p.||Rubens and Optics: Some Fresh Evidence|Jaff√©, Michael|<i>Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes<i>, Vol 34, 1971, pp 362-366.",Opticorum Libri Sex Philosophis iuxta ac Mathematicis utiles.,"Six Books of Optics, Useful for Philosophers and Mathematicians as well.",Latin,1613,1600-1625,"Belgian Jesuit mathematician, natural philosopher, and archittect.

"Francesco Maurolyco, OSB","Maurolyco, Francesco OSB",Maurolico,1494-1575,"Edited by Chrosopher Clavius (1538-1612) German Jesuit teacher at the Collegio Romano, author of important texts in mathematics and astronomy.",Theoremata de lumine et umbra,"Second edition of the spartan march of propositions and proofs coving general optics, with commentary and editing by Clavius. Contains the earliest correct explanation of the operation of the pin-hole camera.
","The second printing of Francesco Maurolyco's <i>Photismi de Lumine et Umbra<i>, with the troublesome work 'Photismi' replaced by 'Theoremata.' The errata page and dedication letter of the 1611 printing is omitted, and the Lyons printer adds his own letter to the reader to that of the 1611 printing. The text of this printing is that of 1611 and its cancels. The figures had been recut and are larger and clearer than those of 1611.||Francesco Maurolyco finished his <i>Photismi de Lumine et Umbra<i> in October of 1521 and the first two books of his Diaphaneon in January of 1522.  In 1554 he added a third book on vision to the Diaphaneon. Though these manuscripts circulated in a limited way for 50 years after they were written, they became widely known after the Jesuit Christopher Clavus from the Collegium Romano visited Maurolyco at Messina in 1574. Clavius was entrusted with the manuscripts of these and other works, in the hope of their being printed at Rome. Optics had gradually become more important at the Collegium Romanum by the end of the 16th century. Though Clavius would edit the <i>Photismi<i> and the <i>Diaphaneon<i>, the midwife of the Naples printing of 1611 was the Naples Jesuit Giovanni Giacomo Staserio. It was Staserio who convinced Clavius of the value and need for Maurolyco's optics work and it was Staserio who found a nobleman in Genoa to pay for the printing--Giovanni Battista Airolo, the dedicatee. The book appeared not long after Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem<i> of 1604 and Galileo's <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> of 1609 when optics assumed a critical part of natural philosophy throughout Europe.|Maurolyco fashioned his texts after the Euclidian model: a Spartan march of propositions, proofs, and demonstrations. They present the earliest explanation of the operation of the pin-hole camera, a theory of vision, a consideration of spectacles for correcting vision, and an explanation of the rainbow--albeit faulty. Maurolyco was the greatest mathematician to work in optics between Ibn al-Haytham in 950 and Johannes Kepler in 1604. He was the first to systematically consider illumination, dealt successfully with penumbral shadow, solved the problem of radiation through small apertures and images from pin-holes, attacked the problem of the rainbow, was the first to explore the geometry of radiation through thin lenses and so gained an understanding of visual theory that pointed to the cause and cure of near and far-sightedness. His extensive work in mathematics allowed him to bring a sophistication to optics beyond that of medieval times and bring a Euclidian clarity of structure to its presentation and demonstration.
"," Francesco Maurolyco's <i>Theoremata de Lumine et Umbra<i> has three topics: Illumination, pin-hole images, and reflections in curved mirrors. The work begins with four definitions and 6 postulates. From these foundations on the rectilinear propagation of light, Maurolyco develops 35 theorems. Theorems 1-21 deal with illumination, shadows, and penumbral shadows. Theorems 22-24 deal with images from small apertures. Theorems 25-35 deal with reflection and curved mirrors. Though theorems 1-21 are geometrically analytic, they are not quantitative so it would be inaccurate to describe them as dealing with photometry. However, they do consider the basic aspects of illumination and the projection of shadows in a qualitative way. Images from small apertures is analyzed using facing pyramids, bases formed by object and image and each apex coincident at point over the aperture. With an analysis of the angles involved, Maurolyco explains how the shape of the image changes with the distance from the aperture. The material on mirrors is entirely traditional, covering convex and concave mirrors, image inversion and burning mirrors.||The Diaphaneon is in three books. Book 1: On refraction. Book 2: On the Rainbow. Book 3: On the Eye and Vision. Book 1 begins with four postulates and presents 24 theorems on refraction and refracted images. This includes images displaced by refraction a plane interfaces, an approximate law of refraction, and ray paths in glass spheres. Book 2 is an unsuccessful attempt to analyze the rainbow based on reflection with a single raindrop. Book 3 is on the structure of the eye and the use of lenses to correct vision. The ocular anatomy is from Vesalius and the rest is traditional perspectivist vision with the crystalline humor as the seat of vision. In this context, Maurolyco investigates the convergence and divergence of rays in concave and convex lenses and, appealing to the requirement for ray symmetry on either side of the crystalline (with its assumed symmetrical lenticular shape), assumes that divergent light entering the crystalline, produced symmetric convergence exiting the crystalline and onto the optic nerve. He then reasoned that if the crystalline were wrongly shaped far or near-sightedness could occur, which could be correct by spectacles.||The commentary and editing by Clavius is particularly important in the Photismi, with evidence of changes and cancels made during the press run. In his letter to the reader, the printer of 1611 makes clear that Clavius' additions, comments, and corrections had been set in italics.","Francesco Maurolico, Giambattista della Porta and Their Theories on Refraction|Bell√©, Riccardo|In: <i>The Optics of Giambattista della Porta(ca. 1535‚Äì1615): A Reassessment<i>|Springer, 2017||I Gesuiti e la pubblicazione dell'ottica di Francesco Maurolico|Bell√®, R.|<i>Bollettino di storia delle scienze matematiche<i>, Vol 26, 2006, pp 211-243||Geometry of Light and Shadow: Francesco Maurolyco (1494-1575) and the Pinhole Camera|Hon, G. and Zik, Y.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 64, No 4, 2007, pp 549-578.||Ptolomey, Alhazen, and Kepler and the Problem of Optical Images|Smith, A.M.|<i>Arabic Sciences and Philosophy<i>, Vol. 8, 1998, pp 9-44.||ùëª <i>The Photismi de Lumine of Maurolycus : A Chapter in Late Medieval Optics<i>|Crew, H. translator|MacMillian, New York, 1940||Bibliographic Analysis: <i>Edizione Nazionale dell'Opera matematica di Francesco Maurolico<i>|http://maurolico.elabor.biz/Maurolico/index.html","Theoremata de lumine et umbra, ad perspectivam, & radiorum incidentiam facientia.","Theorems on light and shadow, to do with Perspectiva and incident rays.",Latin,1613,1600-1625,"Sicilian Benedictine monk, mathematician, astronmer, worked at Messina.

"Roger Bacon, OFM","Bacon, Roger OFM",,1214-1294,"Edited by Johannes Combach (1585 - 1651) German professor of physics, librarian, theologian.",Perspectiva,"Combach's editing of the widely influential medieval optics text, covering light and vision, perception, and reflection and refraction.","Johann Combach's editing of the widely influential medieval <i>Perspectiva<i> of Roger Bacon is one of several texts written or edited by Combach covering a broad range of subjects taught in the Scholastic tradition in northern European universities in the 17th century. In his dedicatory letter to Count Adolph of Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda, Combach states that he worked from an Oxford manuscript of Bacon's <i>Perspectiva<i> (that cannot now be identified) and that he produced this work to make libraries complete; of all the important traditional works in optics, only Bacon's had not been printed. Though it was never as widely used at John Peckham‚Äôs Perspectiva Communis, there are 40 extant manuscripts of Bacon's Perspectiva, ranging in date from the late 13th to the early 16th centuries. If nothing else, it was widely known. A late manuscript and Combach's printing of the <i>Perspectiva<i> were shelved side-by-side in Samuel Pepys' library.|The <i>Perspectiva<i> was part of Bacon's on-going work in optics written between 1240 and when he sent it and other manuscripts to Pope Clement IV at his court in Viterbo in 1267. It became part of the <i>Opus Maius<i>. His sources were Euclid's <i>Optica<i>, Grosseteste's <i>De Luce<i>, Alhacen's <i>De Aspectibus<i>, and the Aristotelian tradition in optics. The three parts of the <i>Perspectiva<i> present Bacon's theory of vision, a perspectival account of several aspects of direct vision and perception, and finally vision by reflected and refracted rays. These last sections make use of--and shows Bacon's facility with--geometrical principles and demonstration.|Bacon's <i>Perspectiva<i> had an important influence on Witelo's recension of Alhacen's <i>De Aspectibus<i> and on John Peckham‚Äôs <i>Perspectiva Communis<i> in medieval times, but it's editing and printing in early modern times when Scholasticism had nearly faded away, was clearly and simply a humanists' self-imposed historical and scholarly task.
","The <i>Perspectiva<i> is in three parts. Part 1: Eye, Brain, and Vision. Species are replicants of light and color, emitted by an object, and propagated through a transparent medium by multiplying (reproducing) them selves. Species enter the eye and are communicated to the brain where they bring about cognition. The optics of the eye works to receive the species and get them to the crystalline humor (lens) which is the seat of vision. It accepts only rays (specified paths) that are perpendicular to it's surface. Species are then  guided to the optic nerve which takes them to the brain.  Eight conditions are required for vision, including species, light, suitable distance to viewed object, sufficient size, object density, transparent medium, sufficient time, and healthy eye. Part 2: Perception, Conditions and Modes of seeing. Bacon presents three modes of knowing: by sense alone, by previous knowledge, and by reason. Various phenomena in vision are considered as relationships between these ways of knowing and the eight requirements for vision. These include near-sightedness, far-sightedness, double vision, visual judgements, and the moon illusion. Part 3: Reflected and Refracted Vision. Euclidian catoptrics and dioptrics provide the framework, with the metaphysics of species providing the reason for the way reflection and refraction behave as they do.","‚ÅÇùëª <i>Roger Bacon and the Origins of 'Perspectiva' in the Middle Ages: A Critical Edition and English Translation of Bacon's 'Perspectiva' with Introduction and Notes<i>|Lindberg, D.C.|Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996, 411 pp.||<i>Geometry and Space: The Celebrated Collection of Books on Geometry, Optics, and Perspective of M.

'Species' were held to be simulacra given off by objects, and their propagation by multiplying themselves through media was the principal explanation for radiation and action-at-distance. Examples were the radiant effects of the sun's heat and light, or the visual perception of a distant object. In his dedicatory letter, Combach summarizes the development of the concept of species and names the philosophers since Aristotle who found it not only a satisfactory explanation for emanating power in general and light in particular, but also truth in its alignment with the nature, power, and work of God.||<i>The De Multiplicatione Specierum<i> was part of Bacon's on-going work in optics written between 1240 and when he sent it and other manuscripts to Pope Clement IV at his court in Viterbo in 1267. It became part of the <i>Opus Maius<i>. Aristotelian teaching and Robert Grosseteste's light metaphysics are Bacon's sources. After defining species and their properties, Bacon considers objects that produce them, how they are produced, how they multiply through a medium, and finally how they are received, weakened, or corrupted. Bacon's adds a detailed mathematically analysis--that is, a geometric analysis--to the propagation of species which had been left vague in the past. The editing and printing of <i>De Multiplicatione Specierum<i> in early modern times when Scholasticism had nearly faded away, was clearly and simply a humanists' self-imposed historical and scholarly task.","Bacon's <i>De Multiplicatione Specierum<i> has six parts. Part 1: Definition of species, their properties, their nature, and their modes of action.  Part 2: Description of how species multiply through a medium. Propagation of visual species along direct line, along a reflected line, and along a refracted line are considered. The behavior of reflection and refraction is ascribed to the density of media. Euclidian geometrical optics is used here to describe the behavior of mirrors. Also considered are the consequences of species having the shape of the emitting object, including spheres, cylinders, and cones. Part 3: The corporeal nature of species has they exist in a medium. This includes the mixing of species in a medium and the generation of color. Part 4: The weakening of species and the relationship to the density or resistance of the medium. Included is a consideration of the time it take species to propagate. Part 5: the degrees of action of species. This is a consideration of the directionality of both emission and incidence and its effect on the power of species, with the perpendicular direction being the strongest and most efficacious. Part 6: The corruption of species. This includes considerations of propagation distance, their continual renewal, and their effect on other species.","‚ÅÇùëª <i>Roger Bacon's Philosophy of Nature: A Critical Edition, with English Translation, Introduction, and Notes, of De multiplicatione specierum and De speculis comburnetibus<i>|Lindberg, D.C.|St. Augustine's Press, South Bend, 1998, 420 pp.||Vision and Certitude in the Age of Ockham|Tachau, K.|Brill, 1988, 428 pp, NB: pp 3-27.","Specula mathematica: in qua, de specierum multiplicatione, earundemque in inferioribus virtute agitur.","The Mathematical Mirror: In which the multiplication of species, and the lesser power of the same, is dealt with.",Latin,1614,1600-1625,"English¬†Franciscan, lecturer at Oxford and University of Paris.

"Christoph Scheiner, SJ","Scheiner, Christoph SJ",,1573-1650," ",Refractiones Coelestes,"Small work on the elliptical appearance of the sun near the horizon and the atmospheric refraction that causes it.","The origin of Christoph Scheiner's <i>Refractiones Coelestes<i> is a small pamphlet <i>Sol Elliptic<i> he published in 1615. He had built a helioscope to project images of the sun and late in 1612 he observed sun spots and the flattening of the circular solar image to an ellipse as it approached the horizon. His <i>Sol Elliptic<i> reports both these discoveries, the flattening being attributed to atmospheric refraction. Two years later and after many more observations of the sun, Scheiner published <i>Refractiones Coelestes<i>. He correctly reasoned that the atmospheric density decreases with elevation and so if light is incident obliquely, it travels in a path of increased curvature as it reached an observer. The closer to the horizon, the more oblique, and so the more curved is the path. Tables of values are given showing the degree of vertical compression for different heights of the sun above the horizon.|Scheiner's instrument and observations were studied and cited by many practical, observational astronomers, including William Gascogne, William Oughtred, and John Flamsteed.
","Scheiner begins with a review of the nature of the atmosphere and its changing density with altitude. This is followed by a theoretical consideration of the altered path of light that enters the atmosphere obliquely, from near the horizon, and the consequences of its curved path. Points closer to the horizon have a more altered path and appear higher above the horizon. That is, the sun appears flattened because rays from its lower edge are refracted more, and so appeared higher above the horizon (more elevated than the actual lower edge of the sun) than rays from its upper edge. This is followed with considerations of mists and clouds and how they affect observations. Scheiner then describes the instrument used to produced the solar images he examined; essentially a telescope used to project a solar image on a screen. Importantly, such instruments were of Scheiner's own construction. As is characteristic of all of Scheiner's writing, the material is tedious in its detail and repetition. An extensive index is provided at the end.","The Optical World of William Gascoigne|Sellers, D.|In: <i>In Search of William Gascoigne<i>, Springer, 2012, pp 69-82.||<i>Christoph Scheiners 'Sol ellipticus'<i>|Daxacker, F.|Ver√∂ffentlichungen der Universit√§t Innsbruck, Vol 226, 1998.","Refractiones coelestes, sive solis elliptici phaenomenon illustratum; in quo variae atque antiquae astronomorum circa hanc materiam difficultates enodantur, dubia multiplicia dissoluuntur, via ad multa recondita eruenda sternitur.

","This is a textbook in the Scholastic style of the process of vision, including a consideration of the structure and function of the eye, the nature of light, and how vision leads to perception. Timpler attempts to bring optics--that is, vision--under his general philosophical umbrella, much as he did with his general physics textbook. That a separate work is devoted to optics, indicates its continuing importance in philosophical and educational systems. In his Dedicatory Letter, Timpler  mentions he has used four optical authors extensively: Alhacen, Vitellus, Risner, and Della Porta. This works are: the <i>Peri Optices<i> and <i>Perspectiva<i> of Alhacen and Witelo that appeared in the <i>Opticae Thesaurus<i> of 1574, edited by Friedrich Risner, Risner's own <i>Opticae libri quatuor<i> of 1606, and Giovanni Battista Della Porta's <i>De Refractione<i> if 1593.||The material is presented in the form of main theorems that begin each chapter. These are followed by problems in which the aspects of the theorem are disputed and proved. Though Timpler cites work that are rich in mathematics, only the more philosophical aspects are considered here.","Timpler's optical work is in two books. Book one has 8 chapters: 1 The Nature of Optics, 2 Vision in General, 3 The Visible, 4 On Shadows, 5 The Medium of Seeing, 6 On the Visual Ray, 7 Inside the Visual Organ, 8 The Conditions of Efficient Vision. Book two has 5 chapters: 1 Simple Vision, 2 Reflected Vision, 3 Refracted Vision, 4 True Vision, 5 False or Mistaken Vision and its Causes.||Timpler defines Optics as the study of the process by which vision occurs.  The is emitted by visible objects and this emission Timpler calls brightness. Brightness is comprised of visual rays or species of visible objects and moves through transparent media. These enter the eye, are 'gathered' by the aqueous humor, fall on the crystalline lens and are carried away by an 'animal spirit'--a kind of visual pneuma--that conducts the species to they brain via the hollow optic nerve. In the brain, the visual rays or species generate sight; that is, perception. The second book considers variations of this basic visual process, depending on whether the line of sight is direct, reflected, or refracted. Book two ends with a consideration of misjudgments of vision and optical illusions and their causes.||The material is entirely Aristotelian and descriptive; no mathematics of any kind is used.","‚ÅÇ The Life, Significance, and Philosophy of Clemens Timpler, 1563/4-1624|Freedman, J.S.|Dissertation, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1982, 916 pp, NB: pp 740-752.","Optic√¶ systema methodicum per theoremata et problemata selecta concinnatum et duobus libris comprehensum.

","First edition of a seminal work on what is now called physiological optics. Scheiner's <i>Oculus<i> has its origins in his work in optics and observational astronomy. He had studied, made, and used lenses in telescopes and in his projector for examining sun spots. By 1619 he had extensive experience with instruments and experiments, and his preface for Oculus makes clear his notion that knowledge is advanced by both mathematics or physics and by experiment. Scheiner is an adherent to Scholastic teachings and so is at pains to show how Aristotelian physics and modern optics are compatible; carefully fitting his experimental results into the Scholastic schema. Including, in the case of the present work, dissection of the eye. He also makes is clear that his treatise is not on the whole of optics 'which is infinite, but only the narrow consideration of the eye itself and of how vision occurs. The Oculus set out the best information available on the eye and the mechanisms of vision, corrected several aspects of ocular anatomy, and included data, experiments, and tests conducted by Scheiner himself. It gave the correct position of the lens, cornea curvature, nasal exit of the optic nerve, lens change in accommodation, light reaction of the pupil and narrowing in accommodation, double images in near and far-sightedness, refractive indices of the various parts of the eye, beam-crossing in the camera obscura and in the eye, and described a functioning model of the eye.||<i>Oculus<i> appeared at Innsbruck in 1619, at Freiberg in 1621, and was closely reprinted at London 1652.

","French translation of Giovanni Antonio Magini‚Äôs work on spherical burning mirrors. Magini's interest was practical and craft-based, as well as theoretical.  He presented large concave spherical mirrors to Jacopo Boncompagni (son of Pope Gregory XIII and Prince of Sora), to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (son Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma), and to the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, and  the Duke of Mantua. Spherical mirrors were of keen interest to Galileo as well. Indeed, Maginis' text was written at Galileo‚Äôs request in order to facilitate the Grand Duke‚Äôs purchase of Magini‚Äôs curved mirrors through the mediation of Galileo.||Ettore Ausonio had produced a widely circulated manuscript <i>Theorica Speculi Concavi Sphaerici<i> in which concave spherical mirrors were analyzed. Particular attention given to focusing properties. Magini saw this through the press, appearing at Bologna in 1602. It was this work that Magini had decided to edit and then completely revise and publish as his 'Brief Instructions' which appeared in 1611. In addition to this French translation that appeared in 1620, the Italian text was published again at Bologna in 1628. ","Magini brief text begins with methods for describing concave spherical mirrors and the effects that they can produced using the sun. Using laws of reflection, two 'fundamental principles' are presented that can be used to understand the operation of all mirrors and the determination of a focal point or the 'point of inversion.' Different image sizes and placements are described, based on position of object and viewing point, including number, magnification, and minification.  Application of a spherical mirror in the camera obscura is also described. The material is descriptive, with only geometry invoked in the demonstrations. Twelve woodblock images appear in the text. Mirror theory with its analysis of focal points and images, was an essential part of the development of the telescope.","<i>Galileo, the Telescope, and the Science of Optics in the Sixteenth Century: A Case Study of Instrumental Practice in Art and Science<i>|Dupr√©, S.|University of Gent, Dissertation, 2002, 366 pp, NB: pp 143-163.||<i>Galileo Engineer<i>|Valleriani M.|Springer, Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, 2010, 320 pp, NB: pp 60-66.","Briefve Instruction, sur Les Apparences et Admirables Effects du Miroir Concave Spherique.

Ninety-one 'problems' are presented, some of several parts, with solutions constituting a collection of experiments, apparatus demonstrations, recipes, and parlor tricks in cosmology, optics, perspective, mechanics, statics, practical geometry, fortification and gunnery. Designed to entertain and instruct. The source for the arithmetical problems was Claude Bachet's <i>Problems Plaisans et Delectables<i> of 1612. The problems in geometry are in the Renaissance tradition of 'practical geometry'; geometry applied to surveying, mensuration, and fortification. Many of the other problems come from the tradition of secretes and natural magic, such as Girolamo Ruscelli's <i>De' Secretis del Alessio Piemontese<i> in the edition of 1615. Some of the problems in natural philosophy appear to be from works by Giambattista Della Porta, Girolamo Cardano, and Salomon de Caus. Renaissance books on conjuring and prestidigitation were a source for the <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i>.||Tradition has assigned authorship to the Jesuit Jean Leurechon, though there is little scholarly evidence for this. Whoever assembled this collection of problems and secrets produced a book that was tremendously popular, being in print in various forms for more than 150 years. Thirty editions in French appeared between 1624 and 1680. Denis Henrion and Claude Mydorge were contributors and commentators for editions between 1626 and 1639, adding significant value to the book. Jacques Ozanam began editing editions in 1694, adding material and changing the content to be more like an encyclopedia. Jean-Etienne Montucla and Edm√© Gilles Guyot were subsequent editors and by 1769 there were four volumes. Translations appeared in English, Latin, Dutch, and German.

Mydorge's <i>Prodromi<i> originates in the 1620s when he worked on lenses and refraction theory with Marin Mersenne, who knew Mydorge's manuscript and mentions it a letter of 1623. By 1627 Mydorge, Ren√© Descartes, and lens maker Jean Ferrier had studied the anaclastic lens of hyperbolic figure and managed to make one. By the time of the Prodromi, Mydorge had intimate knowledge of the optical properties of curves and surfaces and had developed descriptions based not on their figure as produced by sectioning a cone, but rather on their focal properties. He was equally interested in and inventive of ways in which to actually produces these curves. Both aspects would define the <i>Prodromi<i>. Mydorge source for Apollonius was the Latin paraphrase produced by Jacobus Golius from an Arabic manuscript he had collected in the Levant.|The <i>Prodromi<i> would have a considerable effect on Ren√© Descartes and Frans van Shooten. Two more books would be added, and the quartet published in an edition of 1639, followed by reprints in 1640, 1641, 1644, and 1660.
","Claude Mydorge begins with 'Monitum ad Conicorum Opus', a summary of Apolloinius' work and what use Mydorge made of it. Book 1 is titled: On the Elements of Conics, or the Origin, Generation, and Nature Proper to Each Conic Section. The first book covers classical conic sections but adds many problems and their solution new with Mydorge; particularly for elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic curves. Book 2 is titled: Description of the Geometry of Linear Conics in a Plane through a Point. The second book deals with practical methods of generating parabolic and hyperbolic curves. These methods are set in the context of constructing curves and surfaces to be used in optics.||The material in the first book is Euclidian in form; definitions, propositions, proofs, and conclusions. Given its practical purpose, the material in the second book is much more geometric and demonstrative. Mydorge sets out the traditional theory of conic sections as described by Apollonius of Perga in the second century BC, using sections of a right circular cone. Mydorge's first important advance is to define these curves optically; that is, in terms of their foci and what would now be called the directrix, rather than as sections of a cone as Apollonius did. Mydorge then showed how to generate an elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic curves of a given size, or with given foci. All these method lent themselves to drawing methods with practical tools that could generate the desired curve.","The Development of Mersenne‚Äôs Optics|Cozzoli, D.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 18, No 1, 2010, pp 9-25.||Constructive thinking: a case for dioptrics|Dijksterhuis, F.J.|In: <i>The Mindful Hand: Inquiry and Invention from the late Renaissance to Early Industrialization<i>|Koninkliijke, Amsterdam, 2007, 468 pp, NB: pp 59-82.",Prodromi Catoptricorum et Dioptricorum  sive: Conicorum Operis ad Abdita Radii Refleci et Refracti mysteria praeuii & praeferentis.

However reserved, it is the earliest presentation, promotion, and defense of Kepler's work on the ocular optics. Editions appeared at Amsterdam in 1632, and at Louvain in 1648 and 1659.
","Plemp's <i>Ophthalmographia<i> is in five books. Book 1: Description of the External and Internal Eye. Plemp covers the anatomy and structure of the eye, correcting the errors of Galen--chastising him for dissecting only animal eyes--and correctly identifying the six muscles of the eye. Book 2: The Action of the Eye Revealed. This covers  the Aristotelian teaching of light, vision, and perception. The distinction between lux and lumen is maintained, as well as 'visual species' traveling through a potentially transparent medium actualized to transparency by light. Color is produced by the mixing of light and dark, being either real or apparent. Various aspects of vision are discussed, including the conditions necessary for vision to take place. But, it is here that Plemp invokes Kepler's notion of the eye as camera obscura, going to the extent of describing how the reader can construct a camera obscura, including fitting the aperture with a lens, and observing the images it creates. The analogy with the eye is cemented by the direct comparison Plemp makes between parts of the camera obscura and part of the eye. Finally, he describes the partial dissection of an ox eye to fully demonstrate image formation. Book 3: The Function of the Individual Parts. The function of and effect on vision of each part of the eye. Book 4: Problems of the Eye and Vision. Sixty-seven Problems are presented, covering: diseases of the eye and other problems that can affect vision including, double vision, blurred vision, vision from only one eye, methods of maintaining vision, vision in the elderly, vision in the dark, vision in mirrors, illusions and ways in which vision is deceived. Book 5: Effects on the Eye. This is devoted to phosphenes and states that they are produced by mechanical stress within the eye when it is deformed, initiating a chemical response in the 'visual fluid' that flows to the brain.||Though Plemp accepted Kepler's basic notion of lensed image falling on the retina and that the retina was the seat of vision, he did not fully embrace Kepler's geometrical optics. And though he had studied Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> of 1611, he did not include any of its results in his description of the function of the eye, not wanting to introduce the 'teaching of the mathematicians' into medicine. Plemp was an Aristotelian and still wrote of 'visible species', emitted or cast from an object, traveling through a medium, and entering the eye, suffering reflection or refraction by mirror or lens along the way.","‚ÅÇ Vopiscus Fortunatus Plempius|Tricot, J.P.|<i>Vesalius, Journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine<i>, Vol 6, No 1, 2000, pp 11-19.||Early Modern Medical Thinking on Vision and the Camera Obscura.

"Athanasius Kircher, SJ","Kircher, Athanasius SJ",,1601-1680," ",Primiti√¶ gnomonic√¶ catoptric√¶,"Athanasius Kircher's very early work on the construction and operation of sundials that function by reflected light.","The <i>Primitiae Gnomonicae Catoptricae<i> is a very early work of Kircher's on the construction and operation of sundials functioning by reflected light. Interest in sundials had expanded greatly since the early Renaissance and Kircher's work is a summary of the developments made in this art in the previous century. Among the earliest being the <i>Compositio Horologiorum<i> of 1531 and the <i>Typus Universalis Horologiorum Muralium<i> of 1533, both by Sebastian M√ºnster. A work likely known to Kircher was Rafael Mirami's <i>Compendiosa Introduttione alla Prima Parte della Specularia<i> of 1582, in which reflective mural sundials were first described. By the time he wrote the <i>Primitiae Gnomonicae Catoptricae<i>, Kircher had studied horological works and had designed and built two mural sundials for churches.|For Kircher, solar horology was a part of optics and thought it part of the art of light and shadow. Light and its reflection are treated in a completely traditional Scholastic manner, with the elementary geometric aspects of Euclidian optics used as necessary. The material in the <i>Primitiae Gnomonicae Catoptricae<i> would be later reused in Kircher‚Äôs much large work, the <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae<i> of 1646.
","Kircher's <i>Primitiae Gnomonicae Catoptricae<i> is in two books. Book 1: On the Nature and Properties of Reflected Light. The book begins with 13 definitions that present a mix of scholastic teaching on light and reflection and the simpler parts of Euclidean geometric optics. The distinction is made between lux and lumen, between internal and propagated light. Lumen travels in straight lines that can be traced with luminous rays. The Cathetus Rule is used to locate rays after reflection from a mirror's surface. Ten theorems present the fundamental geometry of Euclidian reflection and an additional 11 theorems are devoted to the sun's path in the sky. The book closes with a consideration of the parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptical mirrors. Book 2: Methods of Constructing Sundials by Rays of Reflected Light. After describing the differences between sundials that work by shadow casting and those that work catoptrically, the book then presents 29 Problems. Each problem presents and solves various aspects of constructing sundials that operate by reflected light. The basis for most of these is the 'bow tie' projection of solar position onto a plane. The catoptrical sundials include those that reflect sunlight into a space and onto a surface, plane or curved, delineated to mark the time. Woodcut figures accompany the text.","<i>La Meridiana a Riflessione fu Inventata da Raffaele Mirami?<i>|Saverino, N.|http://nicolaseverino.it, 2007.||<i>Athanasius Kricher's Theatre of the World<i>|Godwin, J.|Inner Traditions, Rochester, 2009, 304 pp, NB: pp 198-206.","Primitiae gnomonicae catoptricae hos est horologiographiae novae specularis.

Gaspar Ens,"Ens, Gaspar",,1570-1645," ",Thaumaturgus mathematicus,"A Latin translation of a  collection  of  mathematical, physical,  chemical  and  technical  puzzles  and  experiments  based on Jean Leurechon's  ""Recr√©ation mathematique""  of 1624.","A Latin translation and slight reworking of the <I>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i>  of 1624 by the Jesuit Jean Leurechon.  Ninety-one 'problems' are presented, some of several parts, with solutions constituting a collection of experiments, apparatus demonstrations, recipes, and parlor tricks in cosmology, optics, perspective, mechanics, statics, practical geometry, fortification and gunnery. Designed to entertain and instruct. The ultimate source for the arithmetical problems was Claude Bachet's <i>Problems Plaisans et Delectables<i> of 1612. The problems in geometry are in the Renaissance tradition of 'practical geometry'; geometry applied to surveying, mensuration, and fortification. Many of the other problems come from the tradition of secretes and natural magic, such as Girolamo Ruscelli's <i>De' Secretis del Alessio Piemontese<i> in the edition of 1615. Some of the problems in natural philosophy appear to be from works by Giambattista Della Porta, Girolamo Cardano, and Salomon de Caus. Renaissance books on conjuring and prestidigitation were a source for the <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i>.||Ens text is somewhat longer than Leurechon's but his descriptions are based on the same figures, being recut for the <i>Thaumaturgus<i> but following Leurechon's very closely. Though it's existance is sometimes disputed, a second edition of the <i>Thaumaturgus<i> did appear in 1651. Both editions of Ens book attest to the lasting popularity of the <I>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i> and books like it. In addition to Ens' Latin, Leurechon's text was also translated in English in 1653, and into Ducth by Wynant van Westen in 1641.","The work begins with a dedicatory letter to Johann Schellart von Obbendorf and a preface to the reader from the author which names some of his sources and the general nature of what he tried to accomplish. Ens used 89 of van Etten's problems, omitting 38 and 46, and adding 25 new problems, with some numbering errors so the last is numbered 113.  This is followed by 55 problems of Alcuin, using the Bede version of 56 problems, but omitting 18. The material covers: Arithmetic, Geometry, Optics and Perspective, Music, Cosmographical Matters. This includes the camera obscura, burning mirrors and lenses, plane and curved mirrors, clear and colored looking-glasses, and the rainbow, all described in a rudimentary way. In this and other early editions, the optical material is limited to display and demonstration, with little or no explanation of the phenomena itself. Nevertheless, they give witness to the abiding interest in everyday optical phenomena.","‚ÅÇ R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques (1624) A Study on its Authorship, Sources and Influence|Heefer, A.|<i>Gibeci√®re<i>, Vol. 1, No 2, 2006, pp. 79-167.||Sources in Recreational Mathematics: an Annotated Bibliography|Singmaster, D.|online at http://www.puzzlemuseum.com/singma/singma-index.htm","Thaumaturgus mathematicus, id est, Admirabilium effectorum e mathematicarum disciplinarum fontibus profluentium sylloge.

The optics sections cover the utility and history of optics, citing many historical sources, the camera obscura, optical instruments, the rainbow and the solar spectrum from a prism, vision, refraction, perspective, mirrors and mirror instruments and viewing boxes.","Daniel Schwenter's <i>Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae<i> is a collection of mathematical puzzles, games, and inventions in diverse fields. Written while teaching arithmetic, geometry, stereotomy, optics, and gnomonics at the University of Altdorf outside Nuremburg, it was published the year of Schwenter's death. The work was written to educate and entertain and culled many popular works for its subjects; the forward contains 12 pages of authors consulted in the book's composition. Most sections begin with a history of the topic and citations of works. It would later be significantly expanded by Schwenter's student, Georg Harsd√∂rffer. As with other books of science popularization of the time, the <i>Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae<i> was widely read. The first edition appeared posthumously in 1636 and was likely edited by Schwenter's student, Georg Harsd√∂rffer, who would expend the work with editions appearing in, 1651, 1653, 1677, and 1692.
","The 16 sections of puzzles and entertainments cover: arithmetic, geometry, stereometry, music, optics, catoptrics, astronomy and astrology , gnomics, statics, motion, fire and heat, pneumatics, hydraulics, writing, architectural and mechanics, and chemistry. The arithmetic section gives the first appearance in German of the use of continued fractions. Some of the arithmetic and geometric problems were borrowed from Leurechon‚Äôs <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i> of 1624. Nearly 100 problems from Leurechon are adopted by Schwenter--but always with the attribution 'aus dem Frankosen'. Several mechanical devices and inventions are described or pictured for the first time, including a sinker for determining specific gravity, a magnetic telegraph, a fountain pen made of two quills and a swivel mount for microscopes. The optics sections (25 pages) cover the utility and history of optics, citing many historical sources. The material includes: the camera obscura, optical instruments, the rainbow and the solar spectrum from a prism, vision, refraction, perspective, mirrors and mirror instruments and viewing boxes. Schwenter also describes a version of his 'scioptric ball' having a hole through its diameter and a lens fitted at each end. This device was placed in the aperture of a camera obscura and because it could swivel over a large range of directions, could produce larger, shaper images of sections from the outdoor scene. In addition, the two lenses did not invert the projected image. The section on the colors formed from sunlight by a prism is an example of what Newton referred to in his letter on a new theory of light and color where wrote that he had determined to 'try therewith the celebrated Phaenomena of Colour'. The treatment of optics is Aristotelian and elementary. The presentation is descriptive and accompanied by simple xylographic figures.","Folding in Recreational Mathematics during the 17th‚Äì18th Centuries: Between Geometry and Entertainment|Friedman, M., Lisa Rougetet, L.|<i>Acta Baltica Historiae et Philosophiae Scientiarum<i>, Vol 5, No 2, 2007, pp 5-34.||R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques (1624) A Study on its Authorship, Sources and Influence|Heefer, A.|<i>Gibeci√®re<i>, Vol. 1, No 2, 2006, pp. 79-167.||<i>Sources in Recreational Mathematics: An Annotated Bibliography<i>|Singmaster, D.|School of Computing, Information Systems and Mathematics, South Bank University, 2004.","Deliciae physico-mathematicae, Oder Mathemat: und philosophische Erquickstunden, darinnen Sechshundert drey und Sechzig schoÃàne, liebliche und annehmliche KunststuÃàcklein, Auffgaben und Fragen au√ü der Rechenkunst, Landtmessen, Perspectiv, Naturkundigung und andere Wissenschaften genommen, begriffen seindt.

Ren√© Descartes,"Descartes, Ren√©",,1596-1650," ",La Dioptrique et Les Meteores,"Two of the three essays Descartes wrote to demonstrate his new method of natural philosophy: La Dioptrique on optics and  vision, Les Meteores on atmospheric phenomena.","Ren√© Descartes's <i>Discours de la M√©thode<i> has it roots in what has been called his micro-mechanical conception of natural philosophy--all physical action, activity, or result was generated, transmitted, or sensed by means of the interaction of particulate matter. He referred to this as 'physico-mathematics' and was his replacement for Scholastic teachings in natural philosophy. Optics was a life-long interest of Descartes, and his earliest study was that of refraction, written in 1619-1621. The first full expression of these and other ideas was his <i>La Monde<i>, nearly completed by 1633, but not published in his lifetime due to the shock created by the condemnation of Galileo in that year. <i>La Monde<i> set out Descartes' mechanical theory of light, described vortex celestial mechanics, and advanced a Copernican cosmography.||In the following three years, Descartes reworked <i>La Monde<i>, removing its Copernican elements, writing what would become the <i>Discours de la M√©thode<i>, along with its three demonstrative essays <i>La Dioptrique<i> on light and vision, <i>Les Meteores<i> on atmospheric phenomena and optics, and <i>La Geomoetrie<i> which introduced analytic geometry. It is known that the essays were produced in order of <i>La Dioptrique, Les Meteores, La Geomoetrie<i> and that the <i>Discours<i> itself was written last. Printing was also in that order and took nearly a year. Written and printed before the rest of the book, copies of <i>La Dioptrique<i> and <i>Les Meteores<i> were known to circulate in Europe in 1636. The present copies are from the library of Count Ricatti. These advanced copies--as it were--of two of the essays drew responses, questions, and criticisms from several European scholars. These and others Descartes received after the <i>Discours<i> appeared in 1637 prompted Descartes to consider a second French edition which would include objections and responses. But by 1639 the publisher Jean Maire reported that the book had sold poorly and a second French edition was not practical. In 1644 a Latin translation appeared, the <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i>, lightly edited by Descartes and lacking the <i>La Geometrie<i>. The Latin would sell well and begin the advance of Cartesian thought in Europe. The initial intellectual interest in Descartes' work was limited to the natural philosophy contained in the essays. Within 30 years, Descartes' physics was augmented with an experimental component, became part of the teaching curriculum in an ever-larger number of schools, and formed the basis of widely used textbooks. Cartesian physics would sweep aside Scholasticism and be dominant in Europe until the rise of Newtonianism in the first quarter of the 18th century.||Editions of the French text of the <i>Discours<i> appeared at Leiden in 1637 and at Paris in 1658, and twice in 1668. The Latin translation appeared at Amsterdam in 1644, twice in 1650, twice in 1656, in 1663, 1664, 1672, 1677, 1685, and twice in 1692; at London in 1664 and Frankfurt in 1692. An English translation appeared at London in 1649. A Dutch translation appeared at Amsterdam in 1656, 1659, and 1692.
","Two of the three essays Ren√© Descartes wrote for the <i>Discours de la M√©thode<i>to demonstrate his new method of natural philosophy: <i>La Dioptrique<i> on optics and  vision, <i>Les Meteores<i> on atmospheric phenomena. La Dioptrique has three principal topics: the nature of light and the laws of optics, vision, and dioptric improvement of vision. These are covered in 10 sections or discourses: nature of light, law of refraction, ocular anatomy, the senses in general, image formation in the eye, visual perception, quality of vision, figure of spectacles, microscopes and telescopes, methods for figuring lenses. Descartes presents light as the percussive effect of a luminous source, transmitted through transparent media such as air and glass, to the eye. This is what Descartes called 'tendency to motion'. The laws of reflection and refraction are obtained from mechanical analogies: the ballistics of tennis balls. It is here that the sine law of refraction first appears in print. Discourse three is on ocular anatomy, influenced by Scheiner. Discourse four is on the senses in general, presenting the mind, situated in the brain, as receiver of impressions of external objects brought to it by the nerves. Discourse five presents ocular function and contains the famed diagram of the eye and an object's image, formed by the cornea and lens, on the retina, which is visible from the back of the eye after the outer tunic is removed. Discourse six gives an account of visual perceptions, including object distance and visual errors. Discourse seven is on the aspects of  vision that account for its acuity, or its lack, including near and far-sightedness and presbyopia. Discourse eight presents lens shapes that can alter light ray paths before entrance into the eye and improve vision. Discourse nine applies the principles of the eighth to microscopes and telescopes, suggesting designs for optical instruments. Discourse ten is on practical aspects of lens production including the formidably difficult problem of producing lenses of hyperbolic figure which would eliminate spherical aberration.||Les Meteores is in ten sections or discourses. Discourse eight presents the correct explanation of the geometric aspects of the primary and secondary rainbows. Using the sine law of refraction, Descartes performed an elaborate calculation and tabulation to show how light from the sun behind an observer is projected by a wall of water drops in front of the observer, back into the observer's eye in the form of an arc. His calculations correctly predicted the angular size of the primary and secondary rainbow arcs. The ninth and tenth discourses offer similar, though qualitative rather than quantitative explanations for halos and parahelia.","The literature on Descartes and his optics is vast.

Pierre H√©rigone,"H√©rigone, Pierre",,1580-1643," ",Cursus Mathematici,"Last volume of the popular 5-volume mathematical encyclopedia, dealing with optics, catoptrics, dioptrics and perspective. Closely following Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i>, it states but does not use the sine law of refraction.","Pierre H√©rigone is actually a pseudonym for the Baron Cl√©ment Cyriaque de Mangin. <i>Cursus Mathematici<i> is his popular 5-volume mathematical encyclopedia, which appeared between 1634 and 1642 and in which he introduced his version and development of Fran√ßois Vi√®te's symbolic language. H√©rigone considered it useful in Pure and Mixed Mathematics and used it throughout the <i>Cursus Mathematici<i>. In this fifth and last volume, H√©rigone deals with optics, catoptrics, dioptrics and perspective, among other topics. With text in French and Latin, it closely following Kepler's Dioptrice, and states but does not use the sine law of refraction. H√©rigone text presents optics immediately before the influence of Descartes and, as stated in his preface, is part of his effort to present an encyclopedic summary of all knowledge with concision and accessibility. The latter is clear from his unusual arrangement of presenting his text in Latin and French, side-by-side. Though read and mentioned by Pierre Fermat, Charles Cavendish,  and Giovanni Borelli, and Isaac Barrow, the influence of H√©rigone's work was limited--it was soon eclipsed by Descartes'. Editions appeared at Paris in 1634-1637 and in 1644.
","H√©rigone's 5th volume covers optics, perspective, spherical astronomy, spherical trigonometry, theory of the planets, gnomics, and music. The 5th volume begins with the optics of Euclid, stating the definitions and elementary parts of geometric optics. The descriptions and proofs of the 61 propositions of geometric optics use H√©rigone's famous mathematical symbology. The presentation of the eye and vision is modern, borrowing the image of the eye from Scheiner's Oculus of 1619 and the description of ocular function from Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604. Euclid's catoptrics is then presented in 33 propositions, again presented and proved with the concision of H√©rigone's symbolic method. The topics include plane and curved mirrors and their focal points. The material on dioptrics is a paraphrase of Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> of 1611 and it is here that H√©rigone states the sine law of refraction--though it is not actually used in the text.

The first explicit statement of the inverse-square law of illumination.","<i>De Natura Lucis<i> of Ismael Boulliau has its roots in his interest in and practice of astronomy and his conversations with his friend Pierre Gassendi. Like Johannes Kepler, Boulliau believed that the study of light and vision was an essential part of astronomy and that optics could be used not only to gather astronomical data but also to understand it. Boulliau considered, for example, the link or similarity between light and the 'motive force' postulated by Kepler to explain planetary motion so strong, that he proposed by way of analogy that this force decreased as the inverse square of the distance from its source, the sun. In this he opposed Kepler, who thought it varied simply as the inverse distance. Boulliau adopted and adapted the optical ideas of Kepler and was, by way of the <i>De Natura Lucis<i> and his vast correspondence, Western Europe's most important popularizer of Kepler's ideas.||In his long letter to the reader, Boulliau references Alhazen, Vitellio, Peckham, and Kepler and recognizes the honorable Aristotelian tradition regarding optics. Though Boulliau was an anti-scholastic in pro-Copernican in celestial matters, he finds it necessary to blend the old ideas with new ones; in particular regarding the nature of light. In addition to his own explication of the nature of light, Boulliau presents in the last half of the book a history of light of the ancient philosophers.
","The <i>De Natura Lucis<i> first presents forty propositions on the nature of light; refuting scholastic notions and adopting most, but no all, Keplerian ideas. Propositions 1-27 involve the nature of light, its propagation, and simple reflection and refraction. The first explicit statement of the inverse-square law of illumination appears in Proposition 27: 'The intensities of light on surfaces are alternately as the squares of the distances of those surfaces from the light source.' Propositions 28-32 involve color and its nature. Propositions 33 and 34 are about luminous species and it is here that <i>De Natura Lucis<i> exhibits a tentative blending of Scholastic ideas with early modern ones. Light is presented as a mean of  corporeal and incorporeal substance. Propositions 35-40 involve light and its propagation in materials. The propositions are followed by notes and explications. The last half of the book is titled Beliefs Regarding Light of the Ancient Philosophers. The philosophies of Plato, Anaximander, Anaxagoras, Heraclitus, the Pythagoreans, Empedocles, the Stoics, the Epicureans, the Aristotelians, Peckham, Alhacen, Witelo, and Ferrari are presented briefly and considered. The book ends with a comparison of light with the human soul or intellect.","Gassendi and Boulliau on Light and Vision|Hatch, R.|In: <i>Quadricentenaire de la naissance de Pierre Gassendi, 1592-1992: Actes du Colloque international Pierre Gassendi, Digne-les-Bains 18-21 mai 1992<i>|Societe Scientific et Litteraire des Alpes de Haute-Provence, 1994, 452 pp, NB: pp 365-385.",De Natura Lucis,On the Nature of Light,Latin,1638,1625-1650,"French cleric, prolific correspondant, and the most important writer on astronomy of his age.",1,1638,,,Paris,Louis de Heuqueville,,,," √£‚Å¥ ·∫Ω‚Å¥ ƒ©¬≤ A-T‚Å¥ V¬≤",[ùüöùüò] 1-155 [ùüô],,Errata on V¬≤·µõ,Contemporary Vellum,8,165,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1638 Boulliau - De Natura Lucis - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,http://www.e-rara.ch/zuz/content/titleinfo/8511719,78,Antiguariaat Forum,48.8566,2.3429
"Jean Francois Niceron, OM","Niceron, Jean Francois OM",,1613-1646," ",La Perspective Curieuse,"A detailed, geometrically practical guide to anamorphosis: Producing distorted perspective images on plane or curved surfaces that require special mirrors or viewing points. Niceron's optics is an illusionist art, rather than a science of light and vision.","Jean-Francois Niceron's <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> is a detailed, geometrically practical guide to anamorphosis. That is, the production of distorted perspective images on plane or curved surfaces that require special mirrors or viewing points. For Niceron, optics as an illusionist art, rather than a science of light and vision. As the title implies, Niceron considered anamorphosis a type of perspective, engaging the question of visual representation and the reliability of the visual sense. In his Letter to the Reader, Niceron lists the great developers of and contributors to the science of perspective but notes how few books on the subject do little more than display figures and scenes, without showing in detail how they were produced. He states that his goal is to remedy that for readers of French and that the title, Curious Perspective, could also have been Artificial Magic--'The one that produces for us the most beautiful and admirable effects, bringing about the art and industry of man.' He cautions new readers not to skip the initial material on geometry or the initial drawing exercises. Published when he was 25, Niceron had been working on anamorphosis (direct, catoptric, and dioptric) since he was 18 and a novice in the Order of Minims, and so the work is that of a practitioner with a deep understanding of geometry, not that of just a theoretician. With La Perspective Curieuse, Niceron makes significant advances in perspective projection methods from his predecessors Salomon de Caus and Jean-Louis Vaulezard. This is particularly the case for spherical projection; without Niceron's technique, interior dome work would have been beyond the ability of virtually all painters. This aspect of Niceron's work also affected the design of instruments, such as astrolabes and globes. La Perspective Curieuse was an acknowledged influence on Emmanuel Maignan's <i>Horographia<i> of 1648 and Charles Plumier's <i>L' Art de Tourner en Perfection<i> of 1749.||The plates were engraved by Joan Blanchin, based on Niceron‚Äôs drawings. Editions appeared in 1638 and edited by Roberval in 1651 and 1663. Niceron's Latin translation, edited by Mersenne, appeared posthumously in 1646 and edited by Roberval in 1663.
","Jean-Francois Niceron's  <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> begins with a Geometric Preliminaries, followed by four books. The Preliminaries set out geometric basics in 7 Propositions. Book 1: Principles of Perspective. Describes a general method for the linear perspective of solid figures, included the complex cases where the figures contact the horizontal plane only along a line or at a point. The process is fundamentally geometric and presented in 15 Propositions, each demonstrated with one or more figures. Examples of the process are give for several solid objects. Book 2: Planar Anamorphosis. Projections are introduced for distorting a regular image so that it appears undistorted only when viewed from a particular viewing point. The undistorted rectangular grid of the image is mapped into a grid distorted by projection. The process is presented in 7 Propositions accompanied by figures. Book 3: Anamorphosis with Cylindrical and Conical Mirrors. Five Propositions and figures present the method for generating a doubly-projected grid. The rectangular grid of an image is mapped onto the projection and an undistorted view is presented only the appropriate mirror. Niceron gives practical advice on metal-casting for mirrors and instructions for their polishing. Book 4: Dioptric Anamorphosis. Five Propositions give the method for generating a projected grid that separates and distorts an image into several pieces. The projection depends on the nature of the intended facetted, dioptrical viewer. The rectangular grid of an image is segregated and distorted according to projected grid and reveals an assembled and undistorted image when viewed with the required facetted dioptric element. The material in all four books is presented with a brevity that requires close reading and careful reference to the many figures in the plates.","Jean Fran√ßois Niceron: Perspective and Artificial Magic|DeRose, A.|<i>FME Transactions<i>, Vol  45, No 2, 2017, pp 215-226.||The Mathematical Treatment of Anamorphoses from Piero della Francesca to Niceron|Andersen, K.|In: <i>History of Mathematics: States of the Art<i>, Christoph J.

Claude Mydorge,"Mydorge, Claude",D.A.L.G.,1585-1647," ",Prodromi Catoptricorum et Dioptricorum,"Books I and II of the 1631 edition on the generation of focal curves for optics, augmented with books III and IV on generating the same and similar conic sections from one another.","Claude Mydorge's four books on the nature, properties, and generation of conic sections, were presented as a necessary preliminary to and geometric basis of reflective and refractive optics. Mydorge's <i>Prodromi<i> originates in the 1620s when he worked on lenses and refraction theory with Marin Mersenne, who knew Mydorge's manuscript and mentions it a letter of 1623. By 1627 Mydorge, Ren√© Descartes, and lens maker Jean Ferrier had studied the anaclastic lens of hyperbolic figure and managed to make one. By the time of the <i>Prodromi<i>, Mydorge had intimate knowledge of the optical properties of curves and surfaces and had developed descriptions based not on their figure as produced by sectioning a cone, but rather on their focal properties. He was equally interested in and inventive of ways in which to actually produces these curves. Both aspects would define the Prodromi. Mydorge source for Apollonius was the Latin paraphrase produced by Jacobus Golius from an Arabic manuscript he had collected in the Levant. The <i>Prodromi<i> would have a considerable effect on Ren√© Descartes and Frans van Shooten.||This edition contains the reissue of books one and two from the edition of 1631, with the addition of books three and four. Edition of all four books appeared in 1639, followed by reprints in 1640, 1641, 1644, and 1660.
","This edition of the Prodromi omits the Monitum ad Conicorum Opus of the edition of 1631 and adds two books to the first two. Book 1 is titled: On the Elements of Conics, or the Origin, Generation, and Nature Proper to Each Conic Section. The first book covers classical conic sections but adds many problems and their solution new with Mydorge; particularly for elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic curves. Book 2 is titled: Description of the Geometry of Linear Conics in a Plane through a Point. The second book deals with practical methods of generating parabolic and hyperbolic curves. These methods are set in the context of constructing curves and surfaces to be used in optics. Book 3 is titled: Conic Sections that are the Same. The first part presents Propositions that detect conic sections that are the same using their parameters. The second part shows how to duplicate a give conic by sectioning a cone. Book 4 is titled: Conic Sections that are similar. Propositions are presented to detect similar conic sections.||The material in the first book is Euclidian in form; definitions, proposition, proofs, and conclusions. Given its practical purpose, the material in the second book is much more geometric and demonstrative. Mydorge sets out the traditional theory of conic sections as described by Apollonius of Perga in the second century BC, using sections of a right circular cone. Mydorge's first important advance is to define these curves optically; that is, in terms of their foci and what would now be called the directrix, rather than as sections of a cone as Apollonius did. Mydorge then showed how to generate an elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic curves of a given size, or with given foci. All these method lent themselves to drawing methods with practical tools that could generate the desired curve. The added material in books three and four is an application of the methods of constructing conic section from book two, but used to either detect duplicate or similar curves, or to generate them.","The Development of Mersenne‚Äôs Optics|Cozzoli, D.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 18, No 1, 2010, pp 9-25.||Constructive thinking: a case for dioptrics|Dijksterhuis, F.J.|In: <i>The Mindful Hand: Inquiry and Invention from the late Renaissance to Early Industrialization<i>|Koninkliijke, Amsterdam, 2007, 468 pp, pp 59-82.",Prodromi Catoptricorum et Dioptricorum  sive: Conicorum Operis ad Abdita Radii Refleci et Refracti mysteria praeuii & praeferentis.

Fortunio Liceti,"Liceti, Fortunio",,1577-1657," ",De Luminis Natura,"The last great Renaissance Aristotelian considers the history of light theories, cites and praises the Perspectivists, and presents and defends peripatetic ideas about light and its properties.
","The last great Renaissance Aristotelian considers the history of light theories, cites and praises the Perspectivists, and presents and defends peripatetic ideas about light and its properties. This includes the nature, propagation, reflection, refraction, and visible effects of light. The origin of this work is, in part, the exchange of letters between Liceti and Galileo and Liceti and Pierre Gassendi. The letters record the changes on the nature of light in general and the whether the phenomenon of the Bologna Stone (Lapide Bononiensi) supported or spoke against Aristotelian teachings on light. These exchanges also involved disagreements regarding the relationship between heat and light. At the same time Liceti wrote <i>De Natura et Efficientia de Luminis<i>, he was writing <i>Litheosphorus sive de Lapide Bononiensi<i> and <i>De Quaesitis Per Epistolas a Claris Viris Responsa Fortunii Liceti Genevenis<i>--all published in 1640. Liceti was setting bulwarks against the rising tide of Italian Renaissance humanist anti-Aristotelianism.||Liceti's intellectual context for considerations concerning light was astronomy, and much of the material in <i>De Natura et Efficientia de Luminis<i> springs from astronomical issues: light emanating from stars and comets, light from the moon, light and heat from the sun. His summary of Scholastic thought regarding light includes citations of Alhazen, Witelo, Peckham, and the medieval Aristotelian commentators. He knows of Maurolyco, Aguil√≥n, Kepler, and Brahe but does not think their work overthrows the Scholastic framework; rather, that it can be incorporated. The <i>De Natura et Efficientia de Luminis<i> is among the last significant texts on Aristotelian optics published in Europe. Kircher's <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae<i>--who borrowed significantly from Liceti--appeared in 1646 and Marin Cureau de La Chambre's <i>La Lumi√®re<i> appeared in 1657. None of these were influential. With the appearance in 1644 of the Latin translation of Ren√© Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i>, Cartesian optics would begin to sweep the field.
","The <i>De Luminis Natura<i> is in three books. Book 1: In which Other Opinions are Presented and Briefly Examined. Liceti examines, in turn, the ideas of Ibn B√¢jja (Avempace), then the various emission theories involving material particles, then the light metaphysics involving intromission of luminous species, and finally the ideas of John Philoponus. Liceti labors to return to what he considers the original ideas of Aristotle, and is not deterred from attacking the ideas of various commentators when he felt they strayed too far from original Aristotelian ideas and concepts. Particularly since these were not just early medieval ideas without influence; many of the notions of the commentators  had contemporary supporters. Liceti's arguments are entirely Scholastic in content and form, lengthy, and tedious. Arguments are won with tight logic and counting up the pros and cons. Book 2: In which all the Essential Attributes of Light-- it's Cause, Origin, Nature, Power, Action, and Effects--are Considered and Carefully Explained. Central to Liceti's presentation of Aristotelian teaching is the distinction between lux and lumen, between internal, powering light, and external, emitted or propagated light. The four Aristotelian causes (final, formal, effective, and material) of light are set out, including the actualization of potential transparency in a diaphanous material. Particularly important is Liceti's consideration of the issue of light's speed of propagation and his compromise of Aristotelian purity to use Euclidian light rays, bestowed with physical reality, to fully account for light's propagation. 'Secondary light' from reflection and refraction is also considered. Then, eleven functions of light are described, including dispelling darkness, providing for vision, producing images, generating colors, casting shadows, generating fire, generating cold, affect humors in the human body, and promoting the lives of animals. Book 3: In which Doubts About the Preceding are Stated and Resolved. In this brief section, raises conventional arguments against the central ideas of Aristotelian optics, and refutes them.","Une th√©orie aristot√©licienne de la lumi√®re du XVIIe si√®cle|Zoubov, V.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 24, No 2, 1935, pp 343-360.","Fortunii Liceti Genuensis in Bononiensi Archigymnasio Philosophi Eminentis.

Rene Descartes,"Descartes, Rene",,1596-1650,"Edited by √âtienne de Courcelles (1586-1659)  Friend of Descartes, Arminian Greek scholar and translator.",Specimina philosophi√¶,"The <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> is the Latin translation of Descartes' Discours de la Methode of 1637, except for its third essay La G√©om√©trie. The <i>Specimina<i> is responsible for the general accessibility and wide-spread advance of Cartesian natural philosophy.
","The Latin translation of Descartes' <i>Discours de la M√©thode<i> has its origins before the French edition appeared late in 1637; Descartes had written earlier to Marin Mersenne about preparing a Latin version himself. In 1638 Descartes gathered comments and objections from readers including Libertus Fromond of Louvain, Vopiscus Plemp, Pierre Fermat, Blaise Pascal, Gilles de Roberval, Jean-Baptiste Morin, and Alphonse Pollot. Most of these objections were written in Latin and so Descartes asked Mersenne to tell his other correspondents to write in Latin. Evidently, by summer 1638 Descartes was planning a second edition of the <i>Discours<i>, in Latin, containing the objections he had received and his answers. But this was set aside, and work began on a second edition in French, with Descartes making corrections and Mersenne acting as editor. But Descartes' publisher, Jan Maire, reported that the first French edition sold very poorly and that a second French edition was not economically practical; Mersenne stopped his editorial work and the project was dropped.||Printed versions of <i>La Dioptrique<i> and <i>Les Meteores<i> had circulated even before the complete <i>Discours<i> appeared in 1637 and not long after, a Latin translations of the <i>Discours, La Dioptrique<i>, and <i>Les Meteores<i> were circulating. Descartes obtained a copy and made corrections and changes intended for the second French edition. The Latin translation--titled <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i>--is traditionally attributed to Etienne de Courcelles, though the evidence is only indirect from Adrien Baillet, the biographer of Descartes. By 1644 Elsevier was publishing Descartes' <i>Principia Philosophiae<i> and proposed to publish the <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> as well. Jan Maire refused to sell the woodcuts for the figures to Elsevier, and so new (and poorer) ones were produced. Baillet states that the <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> appeared without <i>La G√©om√©trie<i> because Courcelles did not have mastery of the subject or that it was known that Van Schooten has already translated it.||The <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> was widely read, influenced natural philosophy profoundly, and marked the real beginning of Cartesianism. It was the <i>Specimina<i>, not the <i>Discours<i>, that was studied by natural philosophers for more than two centuries, was the fons et origo of textbooks for students, and it was here that Europe first read 'Cogito, ergo sum'. Editions appeared at Amsterdam in 1644, twice at Amsterdam in 1650, twice at Amsterdam in 1656, twice at Amsterdam in 1664, at London in 1664, at Amsterdam in 1672, 1677, 1685, twice at Amsterdam in 1692, and at Frankfurt in 1692. 
","The <i>Specimina Philosophiae<i> contains Latin translations of two of the three essays Descartes wrote to demonstrate his new method of natural philosophy: La Dioptrique on optics and  vision, Les Meteores on atmospheric phenomena. La Dioptrique has three principal topics: 1, the nature of light and the laws of optics, 2, vision, and 3, dioptric improvement of vision. These are covered in 10 sections: nature of light, law of refraction, ocular anatomy, the senses in general, image formation in the eye, visual perception, quality of vision, figure of spectacles, microscopes and telescopes, methods for figuring lenses.  Les Meteores contains the correct explanation of the geometric aspects of the primary and secondary rainbows.","<i>A Bibliography of the Works of Descartes I & II<i>|van Otegem, M.|Quaestiiones Infinitae, Vol 37|Publications of the Leiden-Utrecht Research Institute of Philosophy, Utrecht, 2002, 780 pp, NB pp 29-37.||<i>Ren√© Descartes: Specimina Philosophiae, Introduction and Critical Edition<i>|Vermeulen, C.L.|Quaestiones Infinitae, Vol 53|Publications of the Leiden-Utrecht Research Institute of Philosophy, Utrecht, 2007.||ùëª<i> Ren√© Descartes: Discourse on Method, Optics, Geometry, and Meteorology<i>|Translated with Introduction by Paul J.

"Marin Mersenne, OM","Mersenne, Marin OM",,1588-1648," ","Cogitata Physico-mathematica; Universae Geometriae, Mixtaeque Mathematicae Synopsis; Novarum Observationum Physico-Mathematicarum","Three volumes of collected works on mensuration, mathematics, music, mechanics, hydraulics, ballistics, ancient geometry, conics, optics, and systems of the world.
","The works collected here report the culmination of Mersenne's 25 year-long study and investigation into a wide range of topics in Mixed Mathematics; that is, the application of arithmetic and geometry to physics, mechanics, astronomy, music, optics, and conic sections. The <i>Cogitata<i> and the <i>Universae Geometriae<i>  were assembled and published late in his life, Mersenne being 56 when they appeared. He died two years later. From his friar's cell in Paris, he had kept current of most developments in natural philosophy, contributed to mathematics and optics, and struggled to form an amalgam of new ideas that had arisen from experiment, and traditional Peripatetic teaching. Both works show three aspects of Mersenne's thought and work. First, Mersenne held that experimental facts were paramount, and stood above all theorizing. He showed how the reality of these facts must be demonstrated, and their number and strength multiplied by experiment. Many of the pages of the <i>Cogitata<i> are devoted to this endeavor. Second, with the help of his younger mathematician colleague, Gilles Personne de Roberval, Mersenne was able to cast experimental facts into what would now be called mathematical models, attempting to build theories of the physical world. Third, Mersenne strove to make things clear to the reader. This included adding examples, corollaries and extensions, and monita or advice about difficult points. Mersenne's writings also show that he held figures to be important, however complicated, in visualizing a problem and understanding its solution.||The <i>Universae Geometriae<i> of 1644 is a reworking and extension of his <i>Synopsis Mathematica<i> of 1626, a collection of classical and recent texts on mathematics and mechanics. Even at that early date, Mersenne had established an extensive network of correspondents from all over Europe. Information from this network and Mersenne's own study and experiments form the basis for the revision and the extension in the <i>Universae Geometriae<i> of 1644. From the earlier work of 1626, Mersenne includes treatises of Archimedes, Theodosius, Maurolyco, and Apollonius. In the 1644 work the following are included: Euclid's Elements, Ramus' Geometry, Mersenne's own Cosmographia, Mydorge's Conics, Pappus of Alexandria, and extended optics work by Mersenne, Walter Warner, and Hobbes. The <i>Universae Geometriae<i> is a detailed summary of what was held as venerably true and what was new in mathematics and physics in mid-17th century Europe. As such it is a reference work that would be consulted for 50 years, the last significant reference being by de Challes in his <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> of 1690.||The <i>Cogitata<i>  and the <i>Universae Geometriae<i> form Volumes 1 and 2 of a series (though not labeled as such) of three of Mersenne‚Äôs late works. The <i>Novarum Observationum<i> of 1647 is a supplement to the two earlier works and is explicitly labeled as Volume III. A much shorter work, it is a collection of essays on mechanics, pneumatics, hydrostatics, navigation, mensuration, and a consideration of Aristarchus' heliocentric theory. In his Preface, Mersenne states that the <i>Novarum Observationum<i> continues of the <i>Cogitata<i> and this third volumes takes into account new thoughts and experiments, and information from his trips to Italy during 1644-1645 and to southern France in 1646.||There are two important characteristics of the works collected here: Mersenne's rejection of metaphysics as a foundation for physical science, and the role he sees for natural philosophy in defending orthodox Christianity and refuting the rising tide of religious heterodoxy. Regarding the first, he departed from Descartes' ideas and became one of the most modern natural philosophers in early 17th-century France. The tension implied in the second did not prevent Mersenne from becoming an important promoter of Galileo's ideas, including heliocentrism, in France.","The <i>Cogitata<i>  is dedicated to the General of the Minims, Fr. Lorenzo da Spezzano in an epistle, followed by a General Preface that defines terms and list problems, followed by a table of contents. There are five treatises. 1: On weights, measures, and numismatics of Greece, Rome, France, Palestine, and elsewhere. 40 pages. 2: Hydraulics and Pneumatics. This is the earliest attempt of Mersenne to mathematicise physical phenomena and covers a wide range of water-related topics. 174 pages. 3: Four books on: Navigation on and under water, The Magnet, Theory and Practice of Harmony, Musical Instruments. 146 pages. 4: Theoretical and Practical Mechanics. 96 pages. 5: Ballistics, covering the launch and trajectory of cannon and arrows, military bombs, rope properties, and several optical topics. 140 pages.||The <i>Universae Geometriae<i> begins with a Preface and Mathematical Dictionary and Topical Index. There are six sections. 1: The 15 Elements of Euclid in Commandino's translation along with three additional by Fran√ßois de Foix-Candale. 64 pages. 2: Twenty-seven books on geometry by  Pierre de La Ram√©e (Peter Ramus). 27 pages. 3: Archimedes work on the sphere and the cylinder, conics, and other short works. With supplements from Snell and Kepler on cyclometric proportions and the squaring of the parabola. 4: Theodosius of Bithynia, Menelaus Of Alexandria, and Francesco Maurolyco on the sphere. 165 pages 4: Cosmographia by Mersenne, 5: Apollonius of Perga on conics, Claude Mydorge on conics, and Centers of Gravity. 216 pages. 6: Optics, with the first five books by Mersenne, book 6 by English mathematician and natural philosopher Walter Warner, and book 7 being the <i>Tractatus Opticus<i> of Thomas Hobbes. 120 pages.||The <i>Novarum Observationum<i> is in 25 chapters covering a wide range of topics that had long interested Mersenne. 1: Physical phenomena, use of the microscope, ballistics, and center of gravity. 2-3: Weights and measures. 4-5: Problems in water and the vacuum. 6-7: Problems in air, barometers, underwater work. 8: Percussion. 9-13: Free fall, moving bodies, motion experiments. 14: Sound and ballistics experiments made while traveling. 15-16: Free fall, more experiments with material from Galileo and Torricelli. 17: Projectiles. 18: Cylinders and springs. 19: Free fall and the work of Italian mathematician Giovanni Battista Baliani. 20: Harmony. 21: Aspects of number theory. 22: Musical Pitch. 23: Errata. 24: Travelogue to the south of France. 25: Vacuum experiments with tubes and liquids.||The optical material in the <i>Cogitata<i> is contained in the treatise on Ballistics.  Proposition XXV of the Ballistica presents Thomas Hobbes theory of the nature of light. For Hobbes, light propagations by the expansion and contraction of the light source, producing motion in the medium which is transmitted to the eye. Analogies with light, including light speed, reflection, and refraction are presented. Descartes' sine law of refraction is reported, but is explained using Hobbes' theory of light and, importantly, not Descartes' physics.||The seven books of optics in the <i>Universae Geometriae<i> begins with a Preface to the Reader that gives an overview of the material. It includes a figure of eye with an accurate positioning of components. This is clearly from Scheiner's <i>Oculus<i> of 1619. Accompanying the figure is an explanation of image formation by the cornea and lens on the retina, clearly following Kepler. Book 1 gives definitions for light, luminous bodies, shadows, and colors. The structure of the eye, vision, aspects of visual perception are presented. Book 2 covers catoptrics, and mirrors in the shapes of the standard conics. Book 3 covers dioptrics, lenses, and the various types of telescopes. Book 4 is on parallax. Book 5 is on perspective. Book 6 presents problems in refraction, and their solution. This is a posthumous publication of a work of Walter Warner. Book 7 is the <i>Tractatus Opticus<i> of Thomas Hobbes, presenting his theory of light, including its nature, propagation, reflection, and refraction. It is here that Hobbes presents his idea of the light ray as a physical entity with finite extent.||In all of this optics material, Mersenne presents only results. The definitions and theorems presented in the proposition are not proved, merely stated. That Mersenne presents Kepler's, Warner's, and Hobbes' views on refractions aligns with Mersenne‚Äôs notion that seeking the truth requires that various data and points of view be presented and examined. A similar apparent conflict exits in Mersenne presentation of both Witelo's perspectivist explanation of vision based on intromission of visual species into the eye in Book 1, and the Keplerian formulation of retinal images presented in Book 3. By presenting multiple theories on these and other aspects of light and vision, and showing how they can be compatible, Mersenne attempted to establish a bridge between new developments and Scholastic teaching in optics.","Mersenne and Mixed Mathematics|Malet, A., Cozzoli, D.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 18, No 1, 2010, pp 1-8.||The Development of Mersenne‚Äôs Optics|Cozzoli, D.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 18, No 1, 2010, pp 9-25.||<i>The Order of Minims in Seventeenth-Century France<i>|Whitmore, P.J.S.|Matinus Nijhoff, The Hague, 1967, 367 pp, NB: pp 140-154.||<i>Mersenne: le grand minime<i>|Beaulieu, A.|Fondation Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc , Brussels, 1995, 379 pp. ","F.

"Athanasius Kircher, SJ","Kircher, Athanasius SJ",,1601-1680," ",Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶,"Ten books on the natural magic of Light and Shadow. Two books deal with light, color, and vision in Aristotelian terms, seven books deal with horology, and one book deals with the metaphysics of light and light-related phenomena including optical illusions, mirrors, lenses, and the camera obscura.","Athanasius Kircher was visited in Rome by Marin Mersenne in 1644 as Kircher, who by then was known throughout Europe, was finishing the <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i>. It and other topics engaged both scholars, particularly as this was Kercher's first book on natural philosophy. Since 1630 he had produced seven books, each becoming evermore elaborate, encyclopedic, and costly. <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i> appeared in 1645 and was the most elaborate thus far. it contained nearly 1000 pages of facts, imaginings, devices, and topics--however distantly related--regarding light and shadow, augmented with 36 plates of figures, 41 pages of tables, and about 480 in-text drawings. Dazzled, perhaps by the book's elaborateness, it had been approved by two Jesuit censors, both literary men, neither with the understanding necessary to review the contents. And so, the book went to press unfiltered by anyone with a knowledge of optics. But even by mid 18th century standards, 'optics' would not have been considered the principal topic of Kircher's book. As the title makes clear, it is about Light and Shadow, not optics; Perspectiva, Alhazen, Witelo, and Euclid are given only glancing mention. At the end of his preface to the reader, Kircher states he did not want to write a theoretical work and apologizes to his mathematical colleagues for neglecting the material's rigor, especially geometric optics. Kircher is more interested in phenomena and applications.||The disparate, elaborate, compilational nature of <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i> is an expression of a view of knowledge and the world. Kircher believed all human knowledge was linked, is derived from divine wisdom, could be manifested by natural or artificial magic (what today would be called technology), and, following the medieval philosopher Ramon Llull, could be comprehended if the correct organizing framework could be found. The book is not so much structured by its content as it is bound together by--and freighted with--symbolism, Christian Kabbalah, metaphysics, and references to and use of ancient languages. The last is an aspect of Kircher's belief in a single ancient language, his deep interest in philology, and responsible for the strange, Greek-based neologisms in many of the book's section titles.||The elaborate nature of the book made it expensive and limited its audience. Its reception by European scholars was generally negative, expecting as they were a book on optics. It did not help that the book contained what purported to be a geometric method for squaring the circle; natural philosophers and mathematicians across Europe hooted their derision. However strange and unfiltered its content, the book presents the baroque culture of esotericism, natural magic, and the desire to overlay the natural world with an elaborate interconnected structure that spanned history, culture, and geography. Kircher's influence in this regard would be most apparent in his student Gaspar Schott's <i>Magia Universalis Natur√¶ et Artis<i> of 1657. Editions of <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i> appeared in 1646 and 1671. There are two states to the first edition, one with the title page dated 1645 (which is very rare) and one dated 1646. Some copies have a title page for the second half of the book. The emblematic frontispiece was by Pierre Miotte.
","<i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i> contains ten books on subjects related--however tenuously--to Light and Shadow and a final section on optical cryptography and metaphysical epilogue. The meaning of section or book titles are given, rather than direct or literal translation of section titles, since most consist of words Kircher invented.  Book 1: The Nature of Light and Shadow.  Book 2: On Radiation Propagation. Book 3: Curious Gnomics. Book 4: Various Gnomic Horologies. Book 5: Anamorphosis Gnomics. Book 6: Gnomic Shapes for Astrolabes. Book 7: Gnomics by Reflection. Book 8: Gnomics by Refraction. Book 9: Cosmographical Gnomics. Book 10: The Natural Magic of Light and Shadow. Book 1 has three parts. It begins with light sources, including the sun, moon, stars, fire, animal and vegetable light, and light from minerals. This is followed by a 'Scholastic Disquisition' on the nature and effects of light, much of which was lifted from Fortunio Liceti's <i>De Luminis Natura<i> of 1640. The second part of Book 1 considers shadow and its applications including the production of shadow, degrees of shadow, and gnomic shadows. Shadow for Kircher is not the lack of light, but an entity per se. The third part of Book 1 considers colors. This includes various color source and phenomena including atmospheric, sea, refractive, mineral, and animal color. It is here that Kircher presents his color diagram, derived from Francois d' Aguil√≥n's <i>Opticorum Libri Sex<i> of 1613 and adhering to the Scholastic teaching that color arises from a blending of white and black. Book 2 has two parts. It begins with a general consideration of the propagation of 'radiations' from objects; the prototype is light as propagated visible species rendering objects visible when their species are received by the eye. This notion is applied to sound and odor as well. The second part of Book 2 deals with the eye and vision. Though modern ocular anatomy is briefly described, no details are given; most of the material is devoted to projections and scenography. Book 10 is a survey of applications, phenomena, and devices and has three parts. The first part shows the use of reflection and refraction in sundials of various forms. The second part considers projections of various forms and refraction. The camera obscura is described but not explained and it is here that lenses are discussed and Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604 is quoted, leading to a discussion of the telescope. The third part is a general consideration of catoptrics. This includes the nature and properties of plane, spherical, parabolic, and hyperbolic mirrors. Burning mirrors and applications for 'optical wonders' using plane, multiple, and segmented mirrors are presented.||The material in Books 1, 2, and 10 is entirely descriptive; phenomena or apparatus are simply presented, there is rarely any explanation of cause or operation. Mathematics is very rarely used, and then never more than elementary geometry. Aside from some of the material in Books 1, 2, and 10, the majority of the book is on horology.","L 'Ars Magan Lucis et Umbrae' di Athanasius Kircher|Corradion, S.

"Jean Francois Niceron, OM","Niceron, Jean Francois OM",,1613-1646,"Edited by Gilles Personne de Roberval (1602-1675) French mathematician, founding member of the French Academy of Sciences.",Thaumaturgus Opticus (a),"The first two sections of the text of the 1638 edition, considerably augmented with material on light and shadow, rendered into Latin, and edited by Mersenne.","Jean-Francois Niceron's <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i> is a partial reworking and translation into Latin, of his <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> of 1638. Like the earlier version, it is a detailed, geometrically practical guide to anamorphosis. That is, the production of distorted perspective images on plane or curved surfaces that require viewing points. As the Latin title implies, Niceron came to consider anamorphosis a type of natural magic or wonder-working. In his Preface to the reader, Niceron set out his plan for reworking the text of 1638: A section giving the principles of geometry followed by revised books one and two, and these followed by a section on a new scenographic instrument and an appendix on Light and Shadow. There was to be a second part containing revisions of books three and four of the 1638 text on catoptric and dioptric anamorphosis. Niceron worked on the Thaumaturgus Opticus for eight years after the publication of 1638 but his early death in 1646 prevented him from completing what was to be the second half of the work. His fellow Minim member Marin Mersenne edited the manuscript. Niceron's plan must have been fixed from the start, for the revised book one contains references to books three and four. The geometric prelude that precedes Book One is a close Latin translation of the French original. The reworked Books One and Two are considerable expansions of the originals, with more theorems, propositions, and detail.||Niceron had continued to work on practical anamorphosis and the <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i> since <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> of 1638, and so his experience had deepened the detail and examples he brought to the revised work was considerably richer. In 1638 the first two books were accompanied by 10 plates of figures, in 1646 by 35 plates. The last eight plates are devoted to Niceron's scenography and his appendix on light and shadow. The title frontispiece was drawn by Simon Vouet and engraved by Charles Audran. The portrait, executed by Michel Lasne, shows Niceron not long before his death.||With <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i>, Niceron's significant advances in perspective projection methods over his predecessors Salomon de Caus and Jean-Louis Vaulezard are more developed and reach a wider audience. Edited by Mersenne, it appeared posthumously in 1646 and edited by Roberval in 1663.
","Jean-Francois Niceron's <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i> begins with Geometric Preliminaries, followed by two books on anamorphosis, then a description of a scenographic instrument, and ends with an appendix on light and shadow. The Preliminaries set out geometric basics in 8 Propositions and two appendices. Book 1: Principles of Perspective. Describes a general method for the linear perspective of solid figures, included the complex cases where the figures contact the horizontal plane only along a line or at a point. The process is fundamentally geometric and presented in 12 axioms, 37 Propositions, and a synopsis. Each proposition is demonstrated with one or more figures. Examples of the process are give for several solid objects. Book 2: Planar Anamorphosis. Projections are introduced for distorting a regular image so that it appears undistorted only when viewed from a particular viewing point. The undistorted rectangular grid of the image is mapped into a grid distorted by projection. The process is presented in 12 Propositions accompanied by figures. The material in both books is presented with a brevity that requires close reading and careful reference to the many figures in the plates. The Universal Scenograph describes a device of Niceron's invention that allows by direct viewing the drawing of an object in linear or anamorphic projection. It operates as an optical-mechanical equivalent of Durer's perspective grid. The Appendix on Light and Shadow demonstrates techniques for drawing shadows in linear perspective. Interestingly, it includes not only umbral shadows from point light sources but also penumbral shadows from area light sources such as windows. Both the Universal Scenograph and the Appendix are accompanied by plates of figures.","Jean Fran√ßois Niceron: Perspective and Artificial Magic|DeRose, A.|<i>FME Transactions<i>, Vol  45, No 2, 2017, pp 215-226.||The Mathematical Treatment of Anamorphoses from Piero della Francesca to Niceron|Andersen, K.|In: <i>History of Mathematics: States of the Art<i>|Academic Press, San Diego, 1996.||The refractive anamorphic viewer of J.-F.

"Emanuel Maignan, OM","Maignan, Emanuel OM",,1602-1676," ",Perspectiva Horaria,"Exhaustive mathematical and practical treatment of catoptric and dioptric sundials, including lenses and related instrumentation. The most elaborate and detailed book on solar horology ever produced. Also promulgated an influential mechanical kinematic theory of light propagation.","Emanuel Maignan wrote the <i>Perspectiva Horaria<i> near the end of his stay at Santa Trinita Dei Monti in Rome, from 1636 to 1650. A mathematical autodidact in earlier years, he had been stationed there to teach what he had learned. While there, he developed an interest in solar horography, studied it carefully, and experimented extensively with mirrors, lenses, and projections. It is reported that his cell looked more like a work shop or a laboratory. His interests in mirrors and lenses extended into the nature and propagation of light and this broad interest made for a wide interpretation of what was part of solar horography.||Maignan's text was a significant advance in the art of catoptric and dioptric sundials, and though ostensibly about solar horography, it also contained important advances regarding a mechanical theory of light. His source for basic ideas regarding light was Hobbes' <i>Tractatus Opticus<i> published by Marin Mersenne in his <i>Universae Geometriae, Mixtaque, Synopsis<i> of 1644. Building on Hobbes, Maignan proposed a mechanical, kinematic theory of light and its propagation.||As it happened, the <i>Perspectiva Horaria<i> became widely known and cited in the 17th century not for its solar horography, but rather for its material on the nature and propagation of light and its mechanical theory of reflection and refraction. It was read by and influenced Francesco Grimaldi, Pierre de Fermat, Robert Boyle, David Gregory, Jean-Jacques Dortous de Mairain, Isaac Barrow, Christian Huygens, Robert Hooke, and Ignace Pardies; in some cases, if only to argue for an alternative. The <i>Perspectiva Horaria<i> was the most important way in which the mechanical kinematic theory of light, reflection, and refraction was propagated in Europe. Editions appeared in 1648, 1725, and 1748.
","Emanuel Maignan's <i>Perspectiva Horaria<i> is in four books. Book 1: Theoretical Part, or Gnomic Horography. Including the meaning of time, notions of time in different nations, and systems of measurement of time. Basic solar horology including refraction of the sunlight by the atmosphere, a theory of shadows, and the projection of shadows onto plane and spherical surfaces. Book 2: Optical Horography. Including direct or classical sundials on a plane with a gnomon. Practical, detailed instructions for obtaining a plane surface and erecting the gnomon perpendicularly. How to construct inclined planes, calculate the meridian, and determine the elevation of the sun. Instructions in this book are particularly detailed and are accompanied by many figures. Book 3: Catoptric Horography. Methods for projection of sundial maps onto spherical surfaces with detailed instructions on the construction of the instruments required. Sundials that project the solar image onto a vaulted roof and those that admit a 'solar spot' moving on sundial map. The astrolabe painted on the ceiling in the Palazzo Spadani illustrated with a large engraving. The problems of perspective that vault projections cause. Book 4: Dioptric Horography. Maignan presents a mechanical kinematic theory of light, adopted from Hobbes and considerably augmented. Light is regarded as a luminous, fiery effluvium, traveling by 'ray-fronts' moving through a subtle medium. Light speed is shown to be finite and from a kinematic analysis of a ray-front encountering a surface, a theory of specular reflections was obtained. From this same purely mechanical basis, Maignan also established a sine law of refraction. The rest of the book links  dioptrical instruments to the sundial, including determining the angle of refraction. Instructions are give for the construction of the bowl-type of dial which was aligned by means of a magnetic compass. This was the first step towards the miniature portable dials, important as navigational aids in the eighteenth century. The book includes descriptions of instruments and instructions for the figuring and polishing of lenses.||Maignan's text is incomparably clearer, more detailed, and more practical than any previous work on projective horography; direct, catoptrical, or dioptrical. Though the horographical material is elaborately geometric, the material on the theory of light and its reflection and refraction is less so, being more descriptive. Nevertheless, the mechanical theory of light presented in the <i>Perspectiva Horaria<i> would be widely influential for 50 years.","Emmanuel Maignan|Whitmore, P.J.S.|In: <i><i>The Order of Minims in Seventeenth-Century France<i><i>|Nijhof, The Hague, 1967, 367 pp, NB: pp 163-186.||Kinematic Optics: A Study of the Wave Theory of Light in the Seventeenth Century|Shapiro, D.|<i>Archive for History of Exact Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 2, 1973, pp 134-266.||Emmanuel Maignan|In: <i>Biographie Gnomoniche<i>|Severino, N.|Roccasecca, 2011, 404 pp, NB: pp 369-401.||Emmanuel Maignan: Su Vida, Su Obra, Su Influencia|Ce√±al, R.|<i>Revista de Estudios Politicos<i>, Vol 46, 1952, pp 111-149.||<i>Picturing Space, Displacing Bodies: Anamorphosis in Early Modern Theories of Perspective<i>|Massey, L.|Pennsylvania State University Press, 2007, 192 pp.||<i>The Order of Minims in Seventeenth-Century France<i>|Whitmore, P.J.S.|Matinus Nijhoff, The Hague, 1967, 367 pp, NB: pp 163-186.","Perspectiva Horaria sive de Horographia Gnomonica tum Theoretica, tum Practica Libri Quator.","Horological Optics, or On Gnomonic Horology, not only Theretical but also Practical, in Four Books.",Latin,1648,1625-1650,"French Minim friar and natural philosopher.

Johannes Marcus Marci of Kronland,"Marci of Kronland, Johannes Marcus",,1595-1667," ",Thaumantias Liber de Arcu Coelesti,"A nonce volume of Marci of Kronland major works on mechanics and optics, including the rainbow.
","A nonce volume of Marci of Kronland's major works on mechanics and optics. Containing: <i>Idearum Operatri<i> of 1635, <i>Thaumantias Liber de Arcu Coelesti<i> of 1648, <i>De Proportione Motus Figurarum Recti<i> of 1648, and <i>De Proportione Motus seu Regula Sphygmica<i> of 1639. The <i>Thaumantias<i> was his first and principal work in optics, written to explain the rainbow. The more brief <i>Dissertatio de Natura Iridis<i> followed in 1650. Marci's explanation of the rainbow encompasses general considerations of color such as prismatic color, thin film colors from soap bubbles, the nature of white light, and light's propagation. Though Marci cites Alhazen, Roger Bacon, Witelo, Marolyco, and Kepler., he was unaware of the work of Theodoric of Freiberg or Ren√© Descartes, and so independently and correctly determined the refractions and reflections in water drops that produce the primary and secondary rainbows. Marci's work with prismatic colors anticipated Newton's but did not take the final step regarding white light heterogeneity. Though Marci rejected the Peripatetic idea that color arose from blending light and dark he was essentially a Scholastic, and his style of thought, manner of presentation, and assumptions regarding the properties of light are those of late peripatetic teaching. The entire work is framed in classic form and is pedantically tedious:  64 theorem, proofs, examples, and problems.  Caught in and isolated by the 30-years war, Marci's optics work was not widely known, though Huygens mentions Marci in his correspondence. By the time the British scientific establishment became aware of his work and attempted to make contact, Marci had been dead for two years.||A reprint of the <i>Thaumantias<i>, with commentary, was produced at Prague in 1968.","The sections dealing with light and color are as follows. General Introduction; On Condensation and Rarefaction in General; On the Effects of Gunpowder and Fire; On the Transient Nature of Gold and its Effects; On the Nature and Cause of Refraction in General; On the Condensation of Light; Whether the Condensation of Light is the same as Intensity; The way by which the Luminous Sphere is Produced; The Triangular [Prism] Rainbow; Whether the Color Purple is Created by a Ray more Perpendicular than the Red Ray; Of Different Colors; The Nature of Colors White and Black; Tincture of Lignum Nephriticum; What, How and by what Cause Comes Reflection; The Phenomena of the Triangle [Prism] and their Causes; On the Location of Images and their Cause; On Multiplication of Species in the same Medium; Whether Light is Effected as a Form of Fire, and Whether all Light Sources are Fiery; Whether Light and Luminous Appearances from All Sources are one Species; On the Contraction and Distraction of Objects; On The Coloration of Objects; On the Halo or Corona; On the Corona of Lamps; The Color of Aroras and Clouds; Assessment of Other Opinions Regarding the Rainbow; Bubbles and Foams and their Colors; Another Opinion Regarding the Secondary Rainbow; Whether the Angle of the Conical Rays Containing the Rainbow is a Right Angle; Great Rainbow; A Triangular Armillary; The Atmosphere.||The early sections deal with fire and fire related topics since Marci held that fire and light were manifestations of the same fundamental fiery substance. He considered light has a substance that could be compressed, its state of compression proportional to its intensity. Its state of compression was altered by the material in which it traveled and Marci used this to explain reflection and refraction. Light contained color and a motive power by which propagated from a source in a spherical way, and when it struck a reflecting object it re-radiated again in another, secondary luminous sphere. Marci explained color as the direct result of refraction; that is, refraction itself is colorogenic and the angle of refraction determined the color. The smaller the angle of refraction the redder the color, the greater the angle of refraction the  bluer the color. This meant that the angle of incidence also was part of color generation. Color was inherent in light, and need only be 'refracted out of it' to appear. Marci experimented extensively with prisms (his ""Triangles"") and produced rainbows by prismatic refraction--what he called 'Iris Trigonia.' His experiments showed that once refraction had produced a color, that color was immutable and refraction would not alter it. This was something that Newton would later insist on as proving his theory of color and his view of heterogeneous white light.||Marci produced a correct theory of how the primary and secondary rainbows are formed, using two refractions and a reflection to alter the direction of propagation, produced the bow shape, and generate colored bands. He used this same theory explained halos and coronae and, assuming bubble and foam were filled with very tiny water drops, used it to explain the thin film colors in soap bubbles.","Ioannes Marcus Marci (1595-1667)|Aiton, E.J.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 26, No 2, 1970, pp 153-164.||Chymical Wonders of Light: J.

Rene Descartes,"Descartes, Rene",,1596-1650,Translated by Frans van Schooten (1615-1660) Dutch mathematician and professor at the University of Leiden.,Geometria,"van Schooten's Latin translation, with added explanations and commentary, of Descartes' <i>La g√©om√©trie<i>. Algebra and geometry combined to give Analytic Geometry, in a language and explanatory style that produced a book of wide influence.
","Van Schooten knew Ren√© Descartes in 1632 and read his <i>La G√©om√©trie<i> while it was still unpublished. Like virtually all other readers of the original French text of La G√©om√©trie, Van Schooten found it difficult to understand. Nevertheless, he recognized its importance and so reworked the text, added clarifying explanations and commentaries, and translated the result into Latin. It was from Van Schooten's Latin text that Europe's mathematical community learned of Descartes's work.  In the decade following the appearance of the 1649 text, Van Schooten worked with other mathematicians to produce a two volume work containing greatly extended commentaries. This two volume work appeared in 1659 and 1651. It was from this edition that Leibniz and Newton would learn of Descartes's analytic geometry.||Descartes‚Äôs friend Florimond de Beaune wrote the introduction to the 1649 edition. Editions of the Latin text appeared in 1649, 1659, and 1683.
","Descartes's La G√©om√©trie is in three books. Book I applies algebra to geometry to solve many of classical construction problems in geometry; finding points, line lengths, and curves. Book II presents analytic geometry more fully, dealing with the algebraic expression of geometric curves, their use, and their manipulation. Part of this book deals with optics and the use of coordinate geometry to solve optical problems. It is here that Descartes the anaclastic surfaces now called Descartes' Ovals.  Book III takes up geometry construction problems again but in greater detail and with the full power of analytic geometry. Descartes formulates construction problems algebraically, solves the algebraic equations, and then interprets the solutions in geometric terms.||In Descartes's original text he claimed that 'Any problem in geometry can easily be reduced to such terms that a knowledge of the length of certain straight lines is sufficient for construction.' He showed how arithmetic, algebra, and geometry could be combined to solve problems. Descartes believed that the systematic application of algebra to what is now called coordinate geometry could produce solutions to problems that geometry alone was powerless to do. Algebraic coordinate geometry had a generality and mechanizing-like process that gave it great power. He used it, for example, to demonstrate procedures for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing line segments and for graphically determining roots of equations. The extreme concision and lack of explanation made the text difficult to follow; thus the value and influence of Van Schooten's translation, examples, and commentary.","<i>The Geometry of Ren√© Descartes<i>|Smith, D.E, and Latham, M.|Dover, 1954.","Geometria a Renato Des Cartes Anno 1637 Gallice edita; nunc autem Cum Notis Florimundi de Beaune, In Curia Blaesensi Consiliarii Regii, in linguam Latinam versa, & commentariis illustrata, Opera atque studio Fancisci a Schooten, Leydensis in Academia Lugduno-Batava, Mathesoes Professoris, Belgice docentis.","Geometry by Ren√© Descartes, published in French in 1637; But now, with the notes of Florimond de Beaune Royal Counselor in the Court of Blois, translated into Latin and Elucidated by Commenarties, by the Effort and Care of Frans van Schooten of Leiden, Professor of Mathematics in the University of Leiden, Docent of Belgium.",Latin,1649,1625-1650,"French philosopher and mathematician.

"Bonaventura  Cavalieri, ","Cavalieri, Bonaventura ",born Francesco Cavalieri,1598-1647," ",Lo specchio ustorio,"Mathematical explication of conic sections; their properties and applications to optics, gravitational motion, and other mechanical problems. Famous for presenting Galileo's work on parabolic projectile motion, a way to determine the focal length of a thin lens, and considering how Archimedes' burning mirror might have worked.","Second, posthumous edition of Bonaventura Cavalieri's <i>Lo Specchio Ustorio<i> of 1632. Cavalieri's dedication is replaced by a brief letter by Urbano Davisi, but his letter to the reader is retained. The text is an unedited reprint of that of 1632 and using the same figures. Cavalieri hoped to emulate the methods of his great model, Galileo Galilei: abandoning Scholastic teaching, adhering to mathematical rigor, and working to establish a new physics. Cavalieri cites works on mirrors by Roger Bacon and Witelo, among others, but believes Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604 and the <i>Dioptrice<i> of 1611 had swept aside the old optics. Cavalieri's title belies the nature and extensive content of the book. He analyzed four conic curves: sphere, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola. The method of analysis was the law of specular (equal angular) reflection, which he takes as a given.  Cavalieri is not so much interested in the nature of the curves themselves, but how they transform light rays by specular reflection. He extends his analysis using the law of specular reflection beyond the luminous; he writes: ‚ÄòWe shall accept [this] principle not only with respect to light but also to motion as well as sound‚Ä¶heat, cold and in short for anything the motion of which is in straight lines.‚Äô Though he is interested in and considers burning mirrors, Cavalieri extends his analysis of conic surfaces to involve any motive or radiant process that proceeds rectilinearly: motion, sound, heat, and cold. He was the first to define conic section properties in terms of the specular law of reflection, bring rays onto the curves from both convex and concave sides and noting the patterns and intersections of the reflected rays. <i>Lo Specchio Ustorio<i> shows the importance optics attained in 17th century as expressing the power and applicability of the geometric analysis of specular reflection. In was in this manner that Cavalieri assessed the practicality of burning mirrors, dismissed the extravagant claims of Della Porta, was the first to demonstrate that in the absence of air resistance the ballistic trajectory of a cannon ball was a parabola, and described a reflective telescope.||The most lasting influence of Cavalieri's <i>Lo Specchio Ustorio<i> was its derivation of the parabolic cannon ball trajectory and its designs for reflecting telescopes. Though not widely cited, it was a direct influence on Marin Mersenne and his optical work. The book first appeared in 1632 and was reprinted in 1650.
","<i>Lo Specchio Ustorio<i> has 55 chapters. Chapters 1-8 introduce the cone and its sections, from which Cavalieri's four conics are obtained. The process of generating each conic is described, their general application, and their history in solar horology and medieval Perspectiva. Chapters 9-20 describe the properties of the parabola, hyperbola, ellipse, and the circle. 'Properties' for Cavalieri means what the conics do to light ray propagation assuming that their surfaces are mirrors. These have to do with foci, caustics, images, path lengths. Chapters 21-23 covers the generation of surfaces from the conic sections and their properties. A general 'Table of Mirrors' is then given, describing how convex and concave mirrors formed from the conic surfaces affect and effect parallel, convergent, divergent light rays. Chapter 24 describes the use of the Table of Mirrors and presents a 'digression on refraction.' Chapters 25-27 consider burning mirrors of various types. Chapter 28 is devoted to the burning mirror of Archimedes. Chapter 29 is a similar consideration of Della Porta's mirror which he claimed could burn at any distance. Chapters 30-32 present Cavalieri's analysis of Archimedes' and Della Porta's mirrors, how they might have worked (or not) and what was their likely form. Chapters 33-36 consider the application of conic surface to the gathering and intensification of light and sound. It is here that Cavalieri presents his ideas for a mirror telescope. He notes that Galileo's convex and concave telescope lenses can be replaced with mirrors that produce the same convergence and divergence of light rays. Chapters 37-40 consider conic sections and motion. It is here that Cavalieri demonstrates the parabolic trajectory of a cannon ball. Chapters 41-51 present ways to construct (that is, draw) conic sections. Various methods are presented involving points, strings, and lines, as well as various criteria the curves must met. Chapters 52-55 discuss the relationships between the conics, their similarities, and distinguishing features.","Bonaventura Cavalieri, Marin Mersenne, and the Reflecting Telescope|Ariotti, P.E.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 66, No 3, 1975, pp 302-321.||Lo 'Specchio Ustorio' di bonaventura Cavalieri|Baroncelli, G.|<i>Giornale Critiico della Filosofia Italiana<i>, Vol 3, No 6, 1983, pp153-172.","Lo specchio ustorio del P.F.

Marin Cureau de La Chambre,"La Chambre, Marin Cureau de",,1594-1669," ",Nouvelles Observations et Conjectures sur l'Iris,"An explanation of the appearance, shape, and colors of the rainbow; Aristotelian in character and written as if Theodoric of Freiberg or Descartes had never existed.","<i>Nouvelles Observations et Conjectures sur l'Iris<i> appeared the year Ren√© Descartes died, 13 years after the appearance of <i>La Dioptrique<i> and <i>Les Meteores<i>, yet neither Descartes, his optics, or his analysis of the rainbow are mentioned in La Chambre's book. The analysis is entirely Aristotelian, with details added by La Chambre. That a modified Aristotelian explanation of the rainbow should appear in print so long after Descartes' clear analysis appeared in French in 1637 and in Latin 1644, is an important indication of the initial slow and limited reach of Descartes' optics. La Chambre's implied opposition to Descartes reflects the divide over Descartes' ideas and the position of some, but not all French natural philosophers. Jean Baptiste DuHamel, perpetual secretary of the Acad√©mie des Sciences, dismissed Descartes and supported La Chambre in his <i>De Meteoris et Fossilibus Libri Duo<i> of 1660, while the famed atomist Pierre Gassendi in his <i>Syntagma Philosophicum<i> of 1658 considered Descartes' explanation of the rainbow as the last word on the subject.||<i>Nouvelles Observations et Conjectures sur l'Iris<i> appeared at Paris in 1650 and again in 1662. For all of La Chambre's status and influence, he had a checkered reputation even in his own lifetime. The book must have sold poorly; the appearance in 1662 is a reissue of the sheets printed in 1650, with a new title page. A generation later, the Marquis Nicolas de Condorcet, dismissed La Chambre‚Äôs scientific efforts as without value and speculated that perhaps he escaped persecution for his unorthodox views only because his books had so little success even in his own time.
","<i>Nouvelles Observations et Conjectures sur l'Iris<i> has three chapters: The Place of the Rainbow, The Colors of the Rainbow, The Shape of the Rainbow. Chapter 1 is brief and introduces in a negative way the characteristics of the rainbow; that is, where and how La Chambre considers it not be formed. Two types of reflection are introduced, that from mirrors and that from rough and uneven surfaces. These are used later in the explanation of the formation of the rainbow. Chapter 2, by far the longest with 13 Articles, considers color and the colors of the rainbow. Much of this chapter contains material that would later appear in La Chambre's La Lumiere of 1657. In addition to two types of reflectance, two types of transparent media are defined, establishing what La Chambre considers to be four kinds of light. Several articles deal with the general nature of color and the senses. Color is produced by the mixing of reflected and refracted light, and prismatic colors are explained by the mixing that takes place inside a prism or crystal of ice or water as light repeatedly reflects inside the prism, mixing with refracted light and finally exiting in a mixed, that is colored, state. Chapter 3 explains how the rainbow is formed and why it has the shape it does. For La Chambre, light from the sun is refracted and reflected in a subtle, crystalline material, producing colors. This colored light leaves this material and strikes distant clouds where it is reflected back to the observer.||There is no mathematics of any kind in the explanation, and the only reference to experiment or observation is La Chambre's mention of a rainbow he saw in 1625 with an angle of 60‚Å∞ (sic). The elaborately conjectural nature of the explanation of the rainbow--written as if Theodoric of Freiberg or Descartes had never existed--is startling, given the general state of natural philosophy at the time.","<i>The Rainbow: From Myth to Mathematics<i>|Boyer, C.

Much of the optics section deals with optical illusions, phantasma, and projections.","Georg Harsd√∂rffer was a student of Daniel Schwenter and wrote expansions of the latter's <i>Delici√¶ Physico-Mathematic√¶<i> of 1636. In 1651 and 1653 Harsd√∂rffer produced two volumes to follow Schwenter's: <i>Deliti√¶ Philosophic√¶ Et Mathematic√¶ der Philosophischen und Erquickstuden, Zwenter and Dritter Theil<i>. Perhaps more than Schwenter‚Äôs work,  Harsd√∂rffer's was decidedly pedagogical and the most well-known baroque work of 'serious amusement.' In the forward, Harsd√∂rffer write of his hope that school masters would use his book to teach beginning students pleasantly. The 'Erquickstuden' of the title is 'an enlightening pleasure' and Harsd√∂rffer held it was possible to both entertain and instruct. As did Schwenter,  Harsd√∂rffer wrote in German, his audience being the educated lay reader and craftsman, not academics. And though his text was a recreational popularization of natural philosophy, it presented serious contemporary knowledge. He was particularly taken with optics and the illusions produced by those that knew something of that science. He cites Johannes Kepler, Marin Mersenne, Ren√© Descartes, Jan Amos Comenius, and Athanasius Kircher.||Editions of  Harsd√∂rffer's additional volumes appeared at NuÃàrnberg in 1651 and1653 and reprinted in 1677 and 1692.
","The <i>Deliti√¶ Mathematic√¶ et Physic√¶<i> is in 16 Sections: Arithmetic, Geometry, Art of Stereometry or Measurement, Art of Music, Art of Seeing, Mirrors, Astronomy, Clockworks, Weighing, Motion, Fire, Air and Wind, Fountains, Writing, Architecture, Chemistry. Sections 5 and 6 present recreations related to optics. Section 5 (56 pages) presents 39 topics, beginning with a forward that outlines the general nature of light and vision, it's importance in literature and religious symbolism, and ends with a list of historical sources including Danti's translation of Heliodorus of Larrisa, Ptolemy, Alhazen, Witelo ('Tritellio'), John Peckham, Roger Bacon, Giambattista Della Porta, Robert Fludd, Ren√© Descartes, Samuel Marolois, and Athenasius Kircher. Topics 1-5 deal with light and vision, including Descartes vision analogy of a man and his stick. Topics 6-7 deal with perspective. Topics 8-11 deal with refraction, lenses, and images. Topics 12-15 deal with the camera obscura and the eye as its equivalent. Topics 16-24 deal with projects of various kinds including those using lenses. Topics 25-39 deal with vision, shadow, and color, including prismatic colors produced by a glass prism. Section 6 (36 pages) presents 29 topics beginning with a forward that outlines mirrors in history and their appearance in literature and religion. Topics 1-6 deal with the nature of glass, how mirrors are made, characteristics of good mirrors. Topic 7 deals with making a mirror from ice. Topics 8-15 deal with mirror making, curved mirrors of cones and cylinders, mirror anamorphosis, focus of mirrors, segmented burning mirrors, parabolic mirrors. Topic 16 discusses Archimedes burning mirror.

"Marin Mersenne, OM","Mersenne, Marin OM",,1588-1648,"Edited by Gilles Personne de Roberval (1602-1675) French mathematician, founding member of the French Academy of Sciences.",L'Optique et La Catoptrique,"Roberval's editing of Mersenne's final optical text, presenting what he considered the best theories of the nature and properties of light, vision, and catoptrics. Though citing and considering many authors, he accepts Cartesian optical ideas.","The origins of <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i> are manuscripts on optics and catoptrics  Mersenne left at the time of his death in 1648; the later less complete than the former. These works define the end of an arc of ideas that began with his <i>Quaestiones Celeberrimae<i> of 1623 and developed in his <i>Optica<i>  as part of  the <i>Universae mixtaeque geometriae mathematicae synopsis<i> of 1644. Mersenne was a committed Aristotelianism and attempted to accommodate the developments in Johannes Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604 with Scholastic teaching in optics. With the advent of Ren√© Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i> of 1637 and Thomas Hobbes' <i>Tractatus Opticus<i> (published by Mersenne in 1644), he established a synthesis of Cartesian and Hobbesian ideas. This is the  <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i>, which, unlike his earlier work, is not a compendium but rather a series of proposition that state what to Mersenne were the most likely explanations for light and optical phenomena. By 1648 and the writing of the <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i>, Mersenne had adopted Descartes' idea on the nature of light and vision. He does, however, present Descartes' sine law of refraction underpinned with Hobbes' analogy of light as physically moving lines or 'ray fronts.' Unlike the dogmatic Cartesianism that many would later adopt, Mersenne was flexible, always open to alternatives in natural philosophy, and prepared to present and weigh differing views.||Gilles Personne de Roberval is credited with editing Mersenne's manuscripts (which Roberval named <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i>), it is known that he had to do more than just edit. Even though Roberval hewed close to Mersenne's ideas, he added considerably to the text, filled many lacunae, and clarified many sections.||<i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i> marks the mid-17th century transition from Scholastic teaching on optics to an accommodation of the developments of Kepler and Descartes. It appeared in 1651 and 1663, often bound with the third edition of Niceron's <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i>, which was also edited by Roberval.
","Roberval's editing of Mersenne's <i>L'Optique et La Catoptrique<i> has a preface from the publisher followed by two books. In a few initial sentences, the preface states the intention of bringing Mersenne's last optics thoughts into print. The next six pages are, strangely, devoted to a long posthumous defense of Mersenne against the charge brought by Jesuits that he had endorsed a method for squaring the circle. Book 1 is devoted to optics and presents 31 Propositions. The first 9 propositions present the sources, nature, and propagation of light, with luminous rays being the explanatory mechanism. Kepler's influence is very clear, including the inverse-square relationship of distance and illumination. Proposition 10 gives Mersenne's mechanico-ballistic explanation for reflection. Propositions 11-14 deal with illumination and primitive photometry. The power of sunlight is compared to that of candles by way of the inverse-square distance law. Propositions 15-21 deal with the camera obscura and its uses to produce images and assess light sources. Propositions 22 and 23 are on color and shadow. Propositions 24-31 discuss the eye, the process of vision, and visual perceptions. Book 2 is devoted to catoptrics and presents 16 Propositions. The first 5 are on the nature of reflection and a consideration of the various theories that have been proposed to explain the equal-angle law of reflection. Propositions 6-8 consider different types and forms of mirrors. Proposition 10 considers reflected rays and their paths to the eyes. Propositions 11-15 consider image formation by mirrors, magnification, blur. Proposition 16 is on burning mirrors.||The material is on the nature of light is Cartesian, but that on the physics of light is deeply tinctured by Hobbes' physics. The material on the eye and vision is taken directly from Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i>. The arguments or demonstrations of the propositions are by way of analogy; the only mathematics involved is elementary geometry. The material on catoptrics is on the nature and cause of reflection and the general properties of mirrors; it is not what would have been considered geometrical optics.","‚ÅÇThe Development of Mersenne's Optics|Cozzoli, D.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 18, No 1, 2010, pp 9-25.||Roberval ¬´√©diteur¬ª de Mersenne et du P.

There he delivered a course of lectures on astronomy, the notes for which he used in writing a textbook. Gassendi published this in 1647 as his <i>Institutio Astronomica<i>. Like other of his writing, it was decidedly anti-Aristotelian. In addition to basic astronomy, the text considered the Tyconian and Copernican system of the world; but Gassendi plumped (clearly and unmistakably) for the Copernican and the text became widely used, particularly in English universities. The collection appears to have been the idea of the prominent London printer, James Flesher. In his letter to the reader he sets out briefly the value and importance of all three works.

Including them with the <i>Institutio Astronomica<i> produced a textbook of high pedagogical value. It was of wide influence, being in common use for more than half a century, not only in European universities but also those in the American colonies.

","This edition of the <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i> is based on the pirated Frankfurt edition of 1610 and presents Galileo's telescopic discovery of the moons of Jupiter, the topography of the moon, and the stary enumeration of the Milky Way. Though it is a common place to cite its disruptive influence on astronomy and natural philosophy, its effect on optics was just as immediate and profound. That dioptrics could be used to augment vision by magnifying celestial objects--and thus challenge ideas regarding the heavens--prompted the feverish search to understand how the telescope worked, to know how lenses functioned and so be made to perform evermore powerfully, and to evaluate the trustworthiness of vision with lenses and the augmented senses in general. Optical theory and craft sprang up in Europe almost immediately; but most importantly, craft. By 1650 telescopes of sufficient power and clarity had been used to see the shadows on Jupiter cast by its moons, discovered the nebula in the constellation Orion, detected the belts of Jupiter and the markings on Mars, mapped detailed lunar features, and seen that Mizar was a double star.","‚ÅÇ <i>Sidereus Nuncius, Or The Sidereal Messenger.

","Johannes Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> is in 141 numbered sections. They are variously labeled Definition, Axiom, Optical Axiom, Perceptual Axiom, Problem, Proposition, or Notes. There are several sections, each building upon material in previous sections.  1: Refraction at plane surfaces. 2: Light.  3: The lens. 4: Convergence point of a lens.  5: Action of both lens surfaces. 6: The effect of a convex lens by itself. 7: The lens of eye and vision. 8: The use of the lens with respect to the eye. 9: Convex lenses acting together. 10: Concave lenses. 11: Convex and concave lenses acting together. 12: Simple lensed instruments. 13: 'Criptical' lensed instruments.||Sections 1-5 are physical, treating light, glass, and refraction. It begins with Kepler's device for measuring refractive power. It is an idea and image that will appear is optics texts for 150 years, encompassing as it does a demonstration of refraction and means for its measure. Kepler states his approximate law of refraction here: for incidence angles less than 30‚Å∞, the refracted angle is ‚Öî the incidence angle. He establishes convergence points for convex lenses and relates their position to the radius of curvature of the lens, but does not generate any general analytical method for imaging. Sections 6-7 are devoted to the formation of images at the convergence points of convex lenses. Sections 8 deals with how lenses modify vision. The basis is the convergence of rays at the eye, however they may have been modified by lenses after they were emitted by an object. Magnification, minification, and inversion are all treated by assessing the visual angle of rays at the eye; lager angle gives magnification, small angle gives minification. Using this, Kepler explains how a single convex lens can magnify, minify, and invert an object as seen by the eye. It is here that Kepler recognizes spherical aberration. Sections 9-12 describe the operation of the Keplerian telescope and, in Propositions 107-115, the Galilean telescope; that being the highlight and Kepler's goal for the entire work. The last section deals with instruments with various forms of lenses, including menisci.","‚ÅÇ Kepler and the Telescope|Malet, A.|<i>Annales of Science<i>, Vol 60, 2003, pp 107-136.||Kepler's legacy: Telescopes and geometrical optics, 1611-1669|Malet, A.|In: <i>The Origins of the Telescope<i>, KNAW Press, Amsterdam, 2010, pp 281-300.

Ninety-one 'Problems' are presented, some of several parts, with solutions constituting a collection of experiments, apparatus demonstrations, recipes, and parlor tricks in cosmology, optics, perspective, mechanics, statics, practical geometry, fortification and gunnery. Designed to entertain and instruct. The source for the arithmetical problems was Claude Bachet's <i>Problems Plaisans et Delectables<i> of 1612. The problems in geometry are in the Renaissance tradition of 'practical geometry'; geometry applied to surveying, mensuration, and fortification. Many of the other problems come from the tradition of secretes and natural magic, such as Girolamo Ruscelli's <i>De' Secretis del Alessio Piemontese<i> in the edition of 1615. Some of the problems in natural philosophy appear to be from works by Giambattista Della Porta, Girolamo Cardano, and Salomon de Caus. Renaissance books on conjuring and prestidigitation were a source for the <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i>.|Tradition has assigned authorship to the Jesuit Jean Leurechon, though there is little scholarly evidence for this. Whoever assembled this collection of problems and secrets produced a book that was tremendously popular, being in print in various forms for more than 150 years. Thirty editions in French appeared between 1624 and 1680. Denis Henrion and Claude Mydorge were contributors and commentators for editions between 1626 and 1639, adding significant value to the book. Jacques Ozanam began editing editions in 1694, adding material and changing the content to be more like an encyclopedia. Jean-Etienne Montucla and Edm√© Gilles Guyot were subsequent editors and by 1769 there were four volumes. Translations appeared in English, Latin, Dutch, and German.||Editions of the English translation appeared in 1633, 1653, and 1674.

The sections listed are: Arithmetic, Geometry, Optics and Perspective, Music, Cosmographical Matters. There follows 91 'Problems' in these various subjects. The camera obscura, burning mirrors and lenses, plane and curved mirrors, clear and colored looking-glasses, and the rainbow are presented in a rudimentary way.

"Melchior Cornaeus, SJ","Cornaeus, Melchior SJ",,1598-1659," ",Curriculum philosophiae Peripateticae,"A curriculum giving an abridged and simplified course in Philosophy and, usually, aspects of natural philosophy.","Cornaeus' <i>Curriculum philosophiae Peripateticae<i> is a curriculum giving an abridged and simplified course in Philosophy. Unusually, it includes aspects of natural philosophy that are not contained in most Jesuit philosophy courses: doctrines from experimental physics and applied mathematics. This unusual aspect of the <i>Curriculum<i> is justified in the dedication to the Mainz Elector and the letter to the Reader. Cornaeus believes that philosophy can serve not just rulers and the learned but a wider audience only if it includes the applied and natural sciences. The structure of the <i><Curriculum<i> follows the usual elements of Aristotle: Dialectics and Logic; Physics; The Heavens; Meteorology; Life and the Soul; and Metaphysics. Though much of the <i>Curriculum<i> is narrowly scholastic Aristotelianism, Cornaeus admits to the value and importance of knowledge that comes from evidence, and evidence that comes not just from logic but also from the senses--that is, experiment. This includes the sense of vision and its treatment results in a large section on optics. Since optics was considered part of Mathematics, it was very unusual to have it included in a course in philosophy.||Regarding astronomy, Cornaeus defends geocentrism using extracts from Scheiner's <i>Rosa Ursina<i> of 1630 and then quotes extensively from Copernicus' <i>De Revolutionibus<i> of 1543 for the purpose of refuting it with scholastic arguments. Another unusual aspect of the <i>Curriculum<i> is its consideration of the vacuum. Aristotle and the scholastics held that the vacuum was not possible in any natural way. But Cornaeus posits the existence of 'imaginary space' and considers thought experiments conducted in it. This leads to a report of instruments and experiments with vacuum, including those of Torricelli, Berti, and von Guericke. In the end, Cornaeus thinks the experiments support the ancient notion of <i>metus vacui<i>, 'fear of the vacuum' and not the vacuum itself. That is, that mechanical forces observed in the experiments are manifestations of efforts to prevent the vacuum. Cornaeus ends the section on vacuum by noting that (in Latin)  'Every novelty is usually pleasant, but ancient truth is better.' It summarizes the tension between the old and new that is present throughout the entire work and shows Cornaus' textbook to be on the cusp between the the narrowly Aristotelian textbooks still in use early in the 17th century and the new textbooks that would be sparked by Carteisanism later in the century and Newtonianism early in the 18th century.","The material on optics (filling 70 pages) is an aspect of sensations of the soul, treated by Cornaeus in a way grounded in scholastic teaching, but describing modern experimental developments. This includes the physics of light, the physiology of vision, the anatomy of the eye according to Vesalius, and concludes with a series of <i>axiomata optica<i> with diagrams of light cones, perspective, mirrors with their images and burning points, and finally refraction and lenses.||Aristotle's idea that light actualizes the potential transparency of materials, allowing color--the fundamental visual property of an object--to enter the eye. The medieval perspectivist concept of multiplication of visual species is also presented. Some of the experiments performed by Alhacen are also recounted to demonstrate the properties of light. It is in the section of <i>axiomata optica<i> that simple geometric optics is used to analyze perspective, mirrors, and lenses. Consistent with the nature of the curriculum and its audience, there is no mathematics presented and only the simplest geometry in invoked in some of the geometric optics.","The Jesuits and the Janus-Faced History of Natural Sciences|Blum, P.R.|In: <i>Studies on Early Modern Aristotelianism<i>, Brill, 2012, 367 pp, NB: pp 113-138.||Aristotle Among the Jesuits: A Note Concerning a Recent Publication|Garcia, B.|<i>Rivista di Filosofia Neo-Scolastica<i>, Vol 106, No 1, 2014, pp 177-194.||The Rise of the Philosophical Textbook|Schmitt, C.

Marin Cureau de La Chambre,"La Chambre, Marin Cureau de",,1594-1669," ",La Lumi√®re,"An extended, essentially Aristotelian discourse of the nature of light, its sources, motion, color, reflection, and refraction. Most, but not all, in the philosophical tradition of the scholastics. Interwoven with metaphysics, distinctions without differences (four types of light are posited),  and decidedly anti-Cartesian.
","La Lumi√®re has its roots in La Chambre's previous publication <i>Nouvelles Pens√©es sur les Causes de la Lumi√®re<i> of 1634.  Most of La Chambre's ideas--and unique vocabulary--regarding the nature of light and its interaction with objects are here considerably expanded to present an eclectic, Scholastic treatment of light and color. La Chambre rejects Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i> of 1647 and all of the developments in physical optics since Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1640 and ignores most of geometrical optics. Like much of La Chambre's work, <i>La Lumi√®re<i> is a fashionable, gracious, and elaborately written 'discourse' intended, perhaps, to startle and attract with novel theories, but lacking any substantiation let alone experimental support. Even within its temporal context, <i>La Lumi√®re's<i> elaborate light metaphysics, reliance on Scholastic distinctions, and absence of any empirical basis make it something of a medieval throw-back.||La Chambre was a successful physician, well-known physiognomist, well-connected politically--one of the elites of France. All of which may account for <i>La Lumi√®re's<i> publication. But  it was of little influence and must not have a commercial success. It appeared in 1657 and was reissued in 1662 with the sheets of the 1657 printing and a new title page. However lacking in import, La Chambre's <i>La Lumi√®re<i> does mark how slow and gradual was the advance of Cartesianism, even in France.
","<i>La Lumi√®re<i> is in two books. Book 1 'Radical' Light, has four chapters: Four kinds of light in nature; Radical light; The essence of radical light; The cause that produces light. Book 2 'Exterior' Light, has eight chapters: How exterior light is produced; How exterior light subsists in the objects receiving it; The extension of light; The action of light; The movement of light; The reflection of light; The refraction of light; The purpose and usage of light.||The distinction between 'radical' and 'exterior' light is akin to the Scholastic distinction between lux and lumen. The former having to do with the innate or interior luminous power of a light source, the latter the propagated luminous result and subsequent effects of a light emitting object. Invoking the additional Scholastic distinction between substance and accident, color is held to be an accident of light, it's second alternative manifestation. Unlike the traditional Scholastic teaching that color arises from the mixing of light/dark, white/black, La Chambre holds that color arises inherently, not the mixing, of light. Color can be fixed in an object or propagated from it as species and can be changed by attenuation as it moves through a medium. There are then, four kinds of light; two radical (one fixed color, one species color) and two exterior (one fixed color, one species color). Light and transparency is considered as a consequence of the four causes: material, formal, efficient, and final cause. Exterior light is discussed in terms of rays; how they propagate, what they  affect, how they are reflected and how they are refracted. Refraction is treated in the simplest manner, with no reference to Descartes, his <i>La Dioptrique<i>, or the sine law of refraction.||The presentation is entirely descriptive; no mathematics of any kind is involved. It presents what is fundamentally a philosophical treatment of light, rather than a physical or mathematical treatment.","<i>The Rainbow: From Myth to Mathematics<i>|Boyer, C.

"Gaspar Schott, SJ","Schott, Gaspar SJ",,1608-1666," ",Magia Universalis Natur√¶ et Artis,"Four volume encyclopedia on 'artificial magic'--that is, technical inventions, phenomena of nature, and artifices--and the attempt 'to bring hidden, recondite things to light'. ","The root of Caspar Schott's <i>Magia Universalis Natur√¶ et Artis<i> is his work with his teacher Athanasius Kircher. In the <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae<i> of 1646, Kircher promised to write a <i>Magia Universalis<i> but other projects, other books always interfered. Eventually the task, along with Kircher's notes and outline, was give to Schott, who began the two-year project after he left Rome and returned to W√ºrzburg. While in Rome under Kircher, Schott acquired the belief that all human knowledge was linked and manifested by natural or artificial magic (what today would be called technology), and, following the medieval philosopher Ramon Llull, could be comprehended if the correct organizing framework could be found. These ideas are the origin of the scope and style of the Magia Universalis Natur√¶ et Artis, coving in its four volumes optics, acoustics, mechanics and mathematics, and physical phenomena.||Schott makes his expectations and intended audience clear in his Prooemium to the whole work. In his travels he found students, craftsmen, and philosophers in need of careful explanations for phenomena, machines, and inventions. Writing in Latin and yet engaging in the practical, Schott attempts a balance between Aristotelian theory and craft practice. The result is a reference that could be consulted by scholar or practitioner-craftsman. The first and second volumes are devoted to optics and vision and to sound and audition. Their scope is such that they encompass all aspects of these two important senses, a large number of natural phenomena, and many instruments. The third and fourth volumes are devoted to mechanics and mathematics and to physics and phenomena--those things in Mixed Mathematics not covered in the first two volumes. Unlike a traditional Aristotelian course in natural philosophy, astronomy and cosmology are not treated. Unlike Kircher's lager works, Schott's work contains few figures--and those present are of low quality. In most cases, figures were borrowed from previous publications, with the details left to the engraver. The results were often confusing or strange. Presumably all this was to keep costs low.||<i>Magia Universalis Natur√¶ et Artis<i> appeared in 1657 and reprinted at Bamberg in 1677. A German translation of the volume on optics appeared at Bamberg in 1671.
","<i>Magia Universalis Natur√¶ et Artis<i> is in four volumes. Volume 1: Optics and Vision. Volume 2: Sound and Audition. Volume 3: Mechanics, Hydrostatics, and Mathematics. Volume 4: Physics and Physical Phenomena. The first volume on optics contains 10 Books. Book 1: Introduction, the nature of magic--natural, artificial, prohibited--and discussion of each. Book 2: Ocular anatomy and vision, the nature of light and it propagation. Book 3: Anamorphosis and projection. Book 4: Naturally Occurring Images and Visual Phenomena. Book 5: Color. Book 6: Catoptrics and Mirrors. Book 7: Burning Mirrors. Book 8: Images from Mirrors. Book 9: Dioptrics and Lenses. Book 10: Telescopes and Microscopes.||Book 1 is an overview of Magic; that is the study and revelation of the operation of the world. Its purpose was 'to bring hidden, recondite things to light'--as the work's preface has it. Magic was Natural, Artificial, and Prohibited. Natural magic reveal phenomena in nature, artificial magic reveal the functioning of machines and instruments, and prohibited magic delt with the demonic and supernatural. Book 2 presents the ocular anatomy of Scheiner's Oculus of 1619 and a considerable simplification and practicalization of the scholastic teaching on the nature of light. Schott suppresses the distinction between lux and lumen, and regards the fundamental mechanism of vision as the intromission of visible species emitted by objects. Visible species move rectilinearly, and so traditional geometrical optics can be used to both explain and analyze direct, reflected, and refracted vision. Though citing Kepler, Descartes, and Scheiner, Schott find them 'dark, difficult, and almost unbelievable' and so presents a hybrid of ideas: visible species enter the eye, pass through the lens and fall the retina, which he asserts is the seat of vision. There is no ray gathering or focusing by the lens--visible species is the communicating entity between object and retina. Even at the relatively late date at which Schott wrote, he holds it necessary to present an elaborate refutation of the theory of vision rays emitted by the eye.||The anamorphosis material in book 3 is from Niceron's <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> of 1638. The material on catoptrics in book 6 is traditional and borrows heavily from Kircher's <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae<i> of 1646. The material on burning mirrors is an example of the renaissance interest in this subject, and borrows heavily from Della Porta and Kircher. The material on refraction covers the elementary aspects of convex and concave lenses and is entirely practical and instrument-based, including magnifiers and lanterns generating beams of light.||The telescope and microscope material in book 10 is likewise practical, giving and overview and directions for constructing and using both instruments, including lens grinding and mounting. The figures in this section suffer from the fancy of the engraver; what should be shown as (just) an eye, is depicted as an entire man, and so the instruments appear wildly out of proportion.","‚ÅÇ <i>Philosophia, Historia, Technica: Caspar Schotts Magia Universalis<i>|Unverzagt, D.|Dissertation, Technical Universtiy of Berlin, 2000, 340 p.||<i>Jesuit Science and the End of Nature‚Äôs Secrets<i>|Waddell, M.A.|Routledge, New York, 2015, pp 165-182.","P.

Rene Descartes,"Descartes, Rene",,1596-1650," ",Discours de la Methode,"Posthumous, second French edition of Descartes' natural philosophy, including two of the three essays Descartes wrote to demonstrate his new method of natural philosophy: La Dioptrique on optics and  vision, Les Meteores on atmospheric phenomena.","Ren√© Descartes's <i>Discours de la M√©thode<i> has it roots in what has been called his micro-mechanical conception of natural philosophy--all physical action, activity, or result was generated, transmitted, or sensed by means of the interaction of particulate matter. He referred to this as 'physico-mathematics' and was his replacement for Scholastic teachings in natural philosophy. Optics was a life-long interest of Descartes, and his earliest study was that of refraction, written in 1619-1921. The first full expression of these and other ideas was his <i>La Monde<i>, nearly completed by 1633, but not published in his lifetime due to the shock created by the condemnation of Galileo in that year. <i>La Monde<i> set out Descartes' mechanical theory of light, described vortex celestial mechanics, and advanced a Copernican cosmography.||Criticisms and commentaries Descartes received after the <i>Discours<i> appeared in 1637 prompted him to consider a second French edition which would include objections and responses. But by 1639 the publisher Jean Maire reported that the book had sold poorly and a second French edition was not practical. In 1644 a Latin translation appeared, lightly edited by Descartes and lacking the <i>La Geometrie<i>. The Latin would sell well and begin the advance of Cartesian thought in Europe. The initial intellectual interest in Descartes' work was limited to the natural philosophy contained in the essays. Within 30 years, Descartes' physics was augmented with an experimental component, became part of the teaching curriculum in an ever-larger number of schools, and formed the basis of widely used textbooks. Cartesian physics would sweep aside Scholasticism and be dominant in Europe until the rise of Newtonianism in the first quarter of the 18th century.||This edition is a very close reprinting of the text of 1637, excluding <i>La Geometrie<i>. The latter had been found too technical for general reading, and a separate edition of a Latin translation of <i>La Geometrie<i> with commentary had by this time been produced by van Schooten, so it was not printed in this or subsequent editions. It is known that the edition of 1637 did not sell well, and the same was true for this edition. At the time of publisher Henry le Gras' death in 1662, there were still 480 copies unsold. Editions of the French text of the <i>Discours<i> appeared at Leiden in 1637 and at Paris in 1658, and twice in 1668.

It is known that the essays were produced in order of <i>La Dioptrique, Les Meteores, La Geomoetrie<i> and that the <i>Discours<i> itself was written last. Printing was also in that order and took nearly a year. Written and printed before the rest of the book, copies of La Dioptrique and Les Meteores were known to circulate in Europe in 1636.

Giambattista della Porta,"Porta, Giambattista della",Giovanni Battista Della Porta,c1535-1615,Translated by Unknown,Natural Magick,"English translation of the <i>Magiae Naturalis Libri Viginti<i> of 1589. Natural Magic is presented as the practical part of natural philosophy; that is, instruments, practice, and effects. Vison, mirrors and lenses are considered in the optics section.
","This is an anonymous English translation of Giambattista Della Porta's <i>Magiae Naturalis Libri Viginti<i> of 1589, which was significant expansion of his early book on natural magic of 1558. For Della Porta, Natural Magic was the practical part of natural philosophy and focused on exceptional, unusual, extraordinary phenomena, rather than the quotidian. It was the recognition and mastering of natural phenomena, in particular, those phenomena that had to be sought out, phenomena that were otherwise hidden. The point was not to explain the phenomena, but to be able to (re)produce it, display it, describe it and thus reveal nature's secrets. The author and the book changed considerably in the nearly thirty years that separated the first and second editions. Della Porta had mastered a large portion of classical humanist studies by 1589, including the medieval encyclopedias of secrets. From the latter, the scope of the book expanded considerably, and Della Porta established a long list of secrets which the second edition of the Magiae Naturalis was to 'reduce all those secrets into their  proper places.' The second edition is also considerably more experimental in the sense of the direct manipulation of nature. But one aspect of the book and its author did not change: the notion that explaining natural phenomena and unlocking the secrets of nature are fundamentally esoteric activities. Alchemy and Optics are significant portions of the Magiae Naturalis of 1589.|The <i>Magiae Naturalis Libri Viginti<i> established Della Porta's reputation as Europe's leading authority on natural magic. The book was tremendously popular and commercially successful; Antwerp's Pantin Press and Frankfurt's Wechel press were among dell Porta's publishers. Printings of the second Latin edition appeared in 1589, 1591, 1592, 1597, 1600, 1607, 1619, 1644, 1650, 1651, and 1664. An Italian translation appeared in 1611, a German translation appeared at Magdeburg in 1612 and 1617, French translations appeared at Lyon in 1615 and at Rouen in 1657, an English translation appeared at London in 1658 and 1659.
","Giambattista Della Porta presents natural magic as the practical part of natural philosophy; that is, instruments, practice, and effects. There are 20 books: 1: Of the Causes of Wonderful things, 2: Of the Generation of Animals. 3:Of the Production of New Plants. 4: Of increasing Household Stuff. 5: Of changing Metals. 6: Of counterfeiting Gold. 7: Of the Wonders of the Loadstone. 8: Of strange Cures. 9: Of Beautifying Women. 10: Of Distillation.11: Of Perfuming. 12: Of Artificial Fires. 13: Of Tempering Steel. 14: Of Cookery. 15: Of Fishing, Fowling, Hunting, etc. 16: Of Invisible Writing. 17: Of Catoptric Images. 18: Of Statick Experiments. 19: Pneumatic Experiments. 20: Of the Chaos.  Of all the material covered, that considered in book 17 on vison, mirrors and lenses, is probably the most important, it was certainly that with the most extensive and lasting effect. It contains 23 topics: Plane mirrors; Plane mirror illusions; Mirrors for display and the theater; Concave mirrors; Plane and concave mirrors together; Other operations with concave mirrors; How to see in the dark, that which is illuminated by torches; How without a mirror or other device an image can hand in the air; Mixtures of mirrors and their images; The Crystalline Lens and its effects; Lenses for seeing far beyond what can be imagined; Camera obscura; Crystal prism; Burning mirrors; Parabolic burning mirrors and their construction; Parabolic section construction; Parabolic section for burning at infinite distances; Burning glass from spherical sections; Kindling fire more forcefully with refraction; Image outside a concave mirror; Making mirrors; Making plane, convex, and concave mirrors with applied and bonded foil; Making metallic mirrors.||Della Porta is not interested in explaining optical phenomena--he refers the reader to Archimedes, Euclid, Ptolemy, and Witelo--nor does he aim to discern and study the laws of optics to explain the effects. Rather, he seeks to demonstrate and show how it is possible to increase the effect of optical phenomena. The most influential topics are the camera obscura and lenses. Della Porta had added a mirror to the camera obscura to right the image, but by 1589 he places a lens in the aperture to clarify and amplify the image, and more importantly, to make the first suggestion that the eye is like a camera obscura. Concave mirrors are discussed and their numerous images presented in considerable detail. It is in connection with mirror images that Della Porta introduces the point of inversion (where rays cross, the focus) and the use of the cathetus to predict image location.","Knowing by doing in sixteenth-century natural magic: Giambattista della Porta and the wonders of nature|Saito, F.|<i>Circumscribere<i>, Vo1 14, 2014, pp 17-39||<i>Science and the Secretes of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture<i>|Eamon, W.|Princeton University Press, 1994, 490 pp, pp 210-233.||The Optics of Giambattista della Porta(ca. 1535‚Äì1615): A Reassessment|Borrelli, A., Hon, G., Zik, Y., editors|Springer, 2017, 205 pp, NB: pp 169-200.",Natural Magick in Twenty Books,,English,1658,1650-1675,"Neoplitan scholar, polymath, and natural philosopher.

Isaac Voss,"Voss, Isaac",Isaac Vossius,1618-1689," ",Observationes ad Pomponium Melam de Situ Orbis,"An editing of Pomponius Mela's Latin text <i>De situ orbis libri III<i>, followed by Voss's observations. In those, Voss attempts to explain Mela's recording of mountain residents' and sailors' reports of 'atmospheric fire' by considering the nature of light and atmospheric refraction.","Isaac Voss was interested in geography and the texts of the ancients, which led him to take up the project of editing Pomponius Mela's <i>Chorographia<i>, later popularized by Petrarch as <i>De situ orbis libri III<i>. Voss's text was more commentary than philology and included his own extensive observations. His commentary is approximately 5 times longer than Mela's text. This included attempts to explain what Mela recorded being seen by mountain top residents' and sailors' reports of 'atmospheric fire' by considering the nature of light and atmospheric refraction. This project was at the cusp of Voss's interests turning from textual work to the study of the phenomena texts described. In the present case, Voss's interest in and commentary on the optical phenomenon reported by Mela marked the beginning of his work in optics. Optical concepts Voss outlined and invoked in his <i>Observationes<i> would be developed and form the basis for his <i>De Lucis Natura<i> of 1662.||Editions of Voss's <i>Observationes<i> appeared at the Hague in 1658 and at Franeker in 1700.
","Voss's work is a commentary is on Mela's recording of mountain residents' and sailors' reports of 'atmospheric fire.' Residents of Mount Ida in northwestern Turkey, some 20 miles southeast of the ruins of Troy, reported a luminous phenomena at sunrise: lights would begin appearing on the sea's horizon, then gather into a single 'flame', into which the sphere of the sun would then rise. Voss's extensive commentary includes ancient sources citing the same phenomena at Ida and other mountains, and more recent accounts of seamen for similar phenomena. All of which Voss presents as proof of the actual existence of the optical display. The problem had been historically interesting--and unexplained to Voss's satisfaction--because it was only seen from near the top of the mountain, and not from the plains at its base. Voss's explanation was essentially an analysis of lines-of-sight as affected by atmospheric refraction--as defined by Voss. His explanation of the phenomenon was based on claims he made for the nature of the atmosphere,  the properties of atmospheric refraction, and the nature of refraction itself. In these, Voss parted from most recognized optical authorities of the time, asserting, for example, that the atmosphere was homogeneous and that refraction did not take place only at the interface of media but within (even homogeneous) media. These would be extensively developed and become tenets in his <i>De Lucis Natura<i> of 1662.

"Jean-Baptiste Du Hamel, CO","Du Hamel, Jean-Baptiste CO",,1624-1706," ",Astronomia Physica,"A work on the nature of light and colors and planetary astronomy. Unimpressed with Descartes or Gassendi, the presentation on light and color is strictly Aristotelian.  All in the form of a classic scholastic dialog.
","Jean-Baptiste Du Hamel's work on light and color is a summary of then-current theories of Gassendi and Descartes set against traditional Aristotelian teaching. 'Modern' theories are considered, explained, and found wanting. His work on planetary astronomy has its root in his early <i>Elementa Astronomia<i> of 1643 and considers: the nature and motion of celestial bodies; various theories of the motion of the earth, moon, and sun; the fixed stars; and various aspects of practical observational astronomy. Both the optical and astronomical material is presented in the form of a Galilean dialogue involving Simplicius (expressing the views of La Chambre), Meander (expressing the views of Descartes), and Theophilus (the views of Honor√© Fabri).||Though Du Hamel had a considerable reputation during his life--first secretary and historian of the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences--his works of this type were of little influence, being essentially summaries and reactionary defenses of Aristotelianism. Nevertheless, and for that very reason, the <i>Astronomia Physica<i> marks and documents the mounting struggle against Cartesianism in France.||Editions appeared in 1660 and again in the <i>Operum Philosophicorum<i> of 1681.
","Du Hamels' work is in two books. Book 1: On Light and Color; Book 2: On the Nature and Motion of Celestial Bodies. The book on light and color (60 pages) has four chapters. Chapter 1: On the Nature of Light; Chapter 2: On the Motion of Light; Chapter 3: On the Cause of Light; Chapter 4: On the Nature and Diversity of Color.||Chapter 1 presents the Peripatetic theory of light with the distinction between lux and lumen, the Epicurean theory of Gassendi in which light is an effluvium continuously emitted by luminous objects, and the Cartesian in which light an impulse in an aetherial substance that fills the plenum. All are rejected and the Aristotelian theory is defended. Chapter 2 presents light diffusing from all points on a luminous object, until it strikes an opaque surface and is reflected, or a transparent surface and is refracted. Various laws of and mechanisms for refraction are presented. Chapter 3 briefly examines the Aristotelian causes of light and the nature of vision. Chapter 4 presents a color theory similar to La Chambre, with color being fixed and innate and the distinction between real and apparent colors is incorrect. The number and sequence of colors is also discussed.||The material is presented in the form of a Galilean dialogue involving Simplicius (expressing the views of La Chambre), Meander (expressing the views of Descartes), and Theophilus (the views of Honor√© Fabri). The arguments made by Meander are, by far, the weakest. The presentation is entirely descriptive, no mathematics of any kind is used.||Appended at the end of Book 2 are a series of papers by Petit on the solar eclipse visible from Paris on 14 November 1639, on magnetic dip, and on the system of the world.","De kleurtheorie van de Aristotelianen en de opvattingen van De la Chambre, Duhamel en Vossius in de periode 1640‚Äì1670 (in Dutch)|MacLean, J.|<i>Scientiarum Historia<i>, Vol 10, 1968, pp 209-225.","Astronomia Physica seu de luce, natura, et motibus corporum caelestium libro duo.

Carlo Antonio Manzini,"Manzini, Carlo Antonio",,1599-1677," ",L' Occhiale all'occhio,"Early, detailed guide to manufacturing lenses for telescopes, spectacles, and microscopes. Though citing and influenced by the theory in Kepler's Dioptrice of 1611, the material is based on perfected practice and experience.
","The origin and purpose of Manzini's <i>L' Occhiale all'occhio<i> are clear from his preface: He hopes to provide both theoretical basis and practical guidance for the making of spectacle and telescope lenses. He reports traveling around Italy and finding practitioners keeping craft secrets and passing on knowledge orally to apprentices; all without a sound understanding of principles. None of this helps the 'divine mission', he writes, since hard-won and valuable experience is not being recorded and passed on to other practitioners. And he can find no satisfactory written guide to lens making. By Manzini's time, spectacle making had been a craft practiced for three centuries, but though telescope lens making had it roots in that craft, the requirements for precision and quality for telescope lenses surpassed what was acceptable for spectacle lenses. By 1650 telescopes of sufficient power and clarity had been used to see the shadows on Jupiter cast by its moons, discovered the nebula in the constellation Orion, detected the belts of Jupiter and the markings on Mars, mapped detailed lunar features, and seen that Mizar was a double star. The demand for quality telescope lenses was very great.||Manzini's book was a watershed in telescope technology literature. Had built on his Bologna estate an observatory, made his own telescopes, and ground and polished his own lenses. So, he was both user and creator of telescope lenses. In addition, he had worked with the prominent lens-makers, including Eustachio Divini, the greatest practitioner of the age. Manzini's book was a compendium of basic optical theory and practical experience regarding lens making. He distilled optical theory into brief, preliminary chapters, leaving the majority of the book for extensive, detailed, discussions of lens making practice. Significant attention is devoted to spectacle lenses as well, resulting in specific recommendations for lens curvature and age.||Manzini honors Divini by using his portrait as a frontispiece. 
","Manzini's books has 28 short chapters. Chapters 1-5 present a history of the telescope lens, a discussion of the nature of light and its refraction, and an overview the eye and vision. Chapters 6-12 deal with glass, spectacles, and correction of vision. Chapters 13-18 consider types of telescopes and the lenses that are required. Finally, Chapters 19-28 give the detailed process for cutting, figuring, and polishing lenses.||Though Manzini knows Ren√© Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i> and Johannes Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i>, he gives only a descriptive summary of the theories of light and its interaction with with materials. He does explain how to measure the refractive power of glass. The material on the eye and vision has an emphasis on the mechanism of vision, how it can be or become defective, and how spectacle lenses and correct vision. This includes tables for finding the radius of curvature for lenses for a given visual correction. The discussion on glass types is entirely practical, giving brief descriptions of formulations and qualities. Examples are provided for designing telescopes, including determining lens types, focal lengths, and resulting required radii of lens curvature. For this, Manzini develops his own symbolic notion for the analysis and specification of multiple lens systems. Though Manzini believes the very best lenses are hand made, he does give examples of vertical and horizontal lathes and machines that can be used for shaping and polishing lenses. The final 70 pages give a detailed and step-by-step process for making lenses, including the materials required for forms and patterns, types of glass, cutting glass blanks, figuring methods both by hand and my machine, the use of test methods and instruments to check lens properties, and lens polishing.","<i>Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes<i>|Ilardi, V.|American Philosophical Society, 2007, 366 pp, NB: pp 229-233.||Lens Making for Scientific Instrumentation in the Seventeenth Century|Bedini, S.A.|<i>Applied Optics<i>, Vol 5, No 5, 1966, pp 687-694.||Kepler's legacy: Telescopes and geometrical optics, 1611-1669|Malet, A.|In: <i>The Origins of the Telescope<i>, KNAW Press, Amsterdam, 2010, pp 292-295.||Testing Telescope Optics of Seventeenth-Century Italy|Molesini, G.|In: <i>The Origins of the Telescope<i>, KNAW Press, Amsterdam, 2010, pp 271-279.","L' Occhiale all'occhio, Dioptrica Pratica: Dove si tratta della luce; della refrattione de raggi; dell'occhio; della vista; e de gli aiuti, che dare si possono a gli occhi per vedere quasi l'impossibile.

Though Voss was primarily interest in the general history of literature, his interests and collected material were so extensive that they included material on the history of pure and mixed mathematics. Voss was a philologist and historian, not a mathematician, so some of his information was inaccurate but he was the first to use philology and new methods of the study of his sources to produce his historical review of mathematics. He emphasized the translations of Greek classic authors into Arabic and thereafter from Arabic into Latin. Voss considered the publication of translations as important as the publication of original works. The indices include those for objects, words, names, and subjects.||The book first appears in 1650 and was reissued in 1660.
","Voss began with the history of numbers and symbols, and then systematically presented sections on geometry, arithmetic, optics, music, mechanics, logistics, geodesy, astronomy, calendar, chronology.||Optics is considered in the context of several topics: geometry, the rainbow, perspective, vision, architecture, painting, war, geography and its triple nature: direct, reflected, and refracted vision.

Its content was informed by the Jesuit's Ratio Studiorum. Existing student notes reveal a very modern pedagogy based on images and figures. Bourdin drew and etched the figures used in the course, had them printed, and distributed them to his students to lighten the note-taking burden and assure accuracy. The etchings and notes form the basis for <i>Le Cours de Mathematique<i>. The course presents a brief introduction to several fields of Mixed Mathematics appropriate for engineers: Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Mechanics, Optics, and Cosmography. Each is presented by a plate of figures accompanied by numbered notes that are topic outlines and references to figures. Unlike previous editions, Bourdin's material on geometry and fortification is not separated from the main text, but a new, separate 25-page section on optics is added.||It is over optics that in 1640 Bourdain began to famously tangle with Ren√© Descartes, principally over Descartes' plenum of subtle matter, and the mechanisms of reflection and refraction.

He makes it clear in his Prooemium that his goal is to explain the essentials of all the subjects in Mixed Mathematics with clarity, limited detail, and in a way appropriate for beginners. He cites Johann Heinrich Alsted's Encyclopaedia of 1630 and Pierre H√©rigone's <i>Cursus Mathematicus<i> of 1634-1642 as earlier attempts at encyclopedic textbooks but believes them both unsatisfactory because they attempted to be exhaustive and were too detailed. With beginning students in mind, Schott begins every section with an introduction, sometimes of considerable length, and cites works which the beginner can consult to learn more detail. There are more than 100 different works in Schott's citations and the text is accompanied by 577 figures.||The <i>Cursus Mathematicus<i> is organized according to the generally accepted divisions of Mixed Mathematics, covering many areas that would branch into the various fields of natural philosophy. Linking all of them both in order and in connections made between sections, is Schott's belief in the Universality of knowledge, a manifestation of the Llullism he acquired from his teacher Athanasius Kircher. Knowledge is both revealed and understood if the correct structure is adopted and connections made.||The work is dedicated to the young Leopold I, Holy Roman emperor, depicted in the elaborate frontispiece. Even as he wrote it, Schott's <i>Cursus Mathematicus<i> was known to and supported by the Jesuit community. It contains three Par√¶neses--exhortations--he received from fellow Jesuits: Athanasius Kircher, the mathematics teacher Balthazar Conrad, and the Polish mathematician and physicist Adam Adamandy Kocha≈Ñski. Schott's encyclopedic textbook would be the model for that of Fran√ßois Milliet Dechales' <i>Cursus<i> of 1674. Editions of <i>Cursus Mathematicus<i> appeared at W√ºrzburg in 1661, at Frankfurt in 1674, at Bamburgh in 1677, and Frankfurt in 1699.
","The  <i>Cursus Mathematicus<i> covers the following subjects with Mixed Mathematics. Arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, astrology, chronology, geography, navigation, gnomonics, mechanics, statics, hydrostatics, hydraulic engineering, optics, catoptrics, dioptrics, fortification, warfare, tactics, musical theory, algebra, and logarithms. The only traditional part of Mix Mathematics not covered is civil architecture. Each topic is presented in a book, with some requiring more, for a total of 28 books.  Subjects treated at the greatest length are geography, trigonometry, algebra, and astronomy. The most briefly treated are dioptrics, statics, and tactics.||Three brief books and 19 figures are devoted to light and vision, catoptrics, and dioptrics. Book 19 covers the eye and ocular anatomy, the theory of intromission of luminous species, lux and lumen, and what is called 'practical optics' involving rectilinear propagation and the elementary ideas of geometric optics, simple projection, and shadow casting. Book 20 covers catoptrics including simple mirrors, images produced by reflection, the cathetus law. Plan, convex, and concave mirrors are described and finally burning mirrors are considered. Book 21 covers dioptrics including refraction in general, convex and concave lenses, and magnification. The treatment in the three books devoted to optics is elementary and descriptive. The principal ideas of optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics are merely introduced and very briefly described. No mathematics of any kind is invoked, and though very limited, the material would be accessible (and helpful) to a student with no prior knowledge.","Kaspar Schott's 'encyclopedia of all mathematical sciences.'|Knoblock, E.|<i>Poiesis & Praxis<i>, Vol 7, No 4, pp 225-247.","Cursus Mathematicus, sive Absoluta omnium Mathematicarum Disciplinarum encyclopaedia, in Libro XXVIII disgesta, eoque ordine disposita, ut quivis, vel mediocri praeditus ingenio, totam Mathesin a primis fundamentis proprio Marte addiscere possit.

Isaac Voss,"Voss, Isaac",Isaac Vossius,1618-1689," ",De lucis natura et proprietate,"The nature of light and refraction. Adhering to image formation ideas from Witelo and Alhazen rather than those of ray propagation of Kepler. Famously accused Descartes of plagiarism by presenting a manuscript of Snell that shows the sine law of refraction.
","Isaac Voss' <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> has its origins with Voss' study of the optical phenomena reported by  Pomponius Mela involving, the sea, the atmosphere, and the rising sun. In his commentary on Mela of 1658, Voss added an extended note offering an explanation for the phenomena. In doing so he set down several controversial claims that departed significantly from generally accepted ideas. The most bumptious of which was that refraction does not take place only at the interface between two media of different densities, but rather continuously throughout a medium. The denser the medium, the more pronounced the continuous refraction. The most important and detailed response to Voss' claims was from Pierre-Daniel Huet, Voss' friend, colleague in philology, and cleric-scholar from Caen. Huet objected to Voss claims about the atmosphere and how it refracts, but most strenuously to the claim that refraction is continuous in a medium. The <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> is essentially an extended reply to Huet's objections. In it, the treatment of optics is based on visual perception and images, rather than Keplerian ray propagation. That is, from visual phenomena Voss deduces physical phenomena, rather than the other way around. Though an anti-Cartesian, Voss was not an Aristotelian--he had developed his own peculiar ideas regarding optics.||The <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> contains Voss' recounting of his examination of a manuscript of Willebrord Snell and that he discovered the sine law of refraction before Descartes and its appearance in his La Dioptrique of 1637. This alone made the book popular. Though widely read, the book's collection of extreme differences from Keplerian and Cartesian optics generated wide-spread negative reaction among Cartesians. One was the publication in 1664 of <i>De Natura Ignis, Lucis et Colorum Dissertatio<i> by Andr√© Graindorge, a close acquaintance of Pierre-Daniel Huet. Voss would publish a response in the form of the Appendix <i>ad Scriptum de Natura et Proprietate Lucis<i>, added at the end of his <i>De Nili<i> of 1666.
","Isaac Voss' <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> has 32 Chapters. Chapters 1-4 cover the theory of light, presenting and dismissing both Cartesian and Gassendian ideas, maintaining instead that light is a type of luminous fire. Chapters 5-13 consider non-corporeal rays of light and their motion in vacuum. Chapters 14-23 presents Voss' ideas on continuous refraction, and refraction in air, water, glass objects. It is in chapter 16 that Voss recounts what he learned from examining a manuscript of Willebrord Snell and in chapter 18 that atmospheric refraction is considered. Chapters 24-28 are on color, which is presented as an entity separate from light, the intrinsic 'sulfurous quality' of an object.

Francis Bacon,"Bacon, Francis",,1561-1626,Edited by William Rawley,Opuscula Francisci Baconi,"Small works edited and published by Bacon's friend and literary executor William Rawley, including 12 inquires relating to lux and light. These include sources of light, motion of light, photometry, colors, reflection, chemical effects of light,  phosphoric light, transparency and opacity, and both the affinity and hostility to light.
","William Rawley was chaplain to Francis Bacon, his literary executor, and foremost champion in the 17th century. As Rawley makes clear in his letter to the reader, he published this posthumous collection of Bacon's essays to bring more of Bacon's ideas to the public, and in particular his ideas on natural philosophy and 'the art of knowing'. The latter includes Bacon's method for the role, type, and use of experiments in establishing certainty in matter of natural philosophy. Newton owned a copy of the 1658 edition of Rawley's Opuscula Francisci Baconi and it was dog-eared at page 17. This page is from Bacon's Historia Densi et Rari and describes Bacon's experimental process (in this case for establishing a table of material densities) culminating in an <i>experimentun crucis<i>. Newton was certainly aware of Bacon's process and its influence can be detected in Newton's letter Concerning a New Theory of Light and Colors of 1672. In addition to Bacon's <i>Historia Densi <i>and <i>Rari<i>, Rawley's text includes the brief <i>Topica Inquisitionis de Luce & Lumine<i>, Bacon's directions for a general inquiry of the nature of light and color.||Editions of Rawley's edited text appeared at London in 1658 and at Amsterdam in 1663.
","William Rawley's  <i>Opuscula Francisci Baconi<i> contains smaller works on philosophy, government, and theology. The work begins with a life of Bacon written by Rawley, then: Historia Densi et Rari, Historia & Inqusisition de Sone & Audibilibus; Articuli Inquistionis de Metallis & Mineralibus; Inquisitio de Magnete; Inquisition de Versionibus, Transmutationibus, Mutiplicationibus, & Effectionbus Corporum; Topica Inquistionis de Luce & Lumine; Espistol Fugentium; In felicem memoriam Elizabethae Anglliae Reginae; Imago Civilis Julii Caesaris; Imago Civilis Aususti Caesaries; Confessio Fidei Anglicano.||The bulk of the material deals with natural philosophy, including the measurement of densities, the nature of sound, metals, magnetism, alchemy, and light. The material on densities includes a detailed example of Bacon's experimental process, to test, distinguish, and finally make certain with an experimentum crucis. This was of particular interest to Isaac Newton. The material on light is a list of 12 inquires Bacon considered essential to investigate lux and lumen--Bacon maintaining the medieval distinction between lux and lumen, between interior luminous power and external emitted light. These inquires include sources of light, motion of light, photometry, colors, reflection, chemical effects of light,  phosphoric light, transparency and opacity, and both the affinity and hostility to light. Each is accompanied by commentary and research subjects.","<i>The Art of Experimental Natural History: Francis Bacon in Context<i>|Jalobeanu, D.|Zeta Book, 2015, 344 pp, NB: pp 307-315.||Crucial Instances and Crucial Experiments in Bacon, Boyle, and Hooke|Dumitru, C.|<i>Society and Politics<i>, Vol 7, No 1 ,2013, pp 45-61.||<i>Precis de la Philoslophie de Bacon<i>, Vol 2|Delac, J.-A.|Paris, Jean-Luc Nyon, 1802, pp 91-99.||Topica Inquisitionis de Luce et Lumine|In: <i>The Works of Francis Bacon Vol II<i>|Spedding, J., Ellis, R.L., Heath, D.D., editors|Longmon & Co, London, 1857, pp 313-325.","Opuscula Varia Posthuma, Philosophica, Civilia, et Theologica.

Euclid,Euclid,Euclid of Alexandria,c295 BC,"Translated by Roland Freart de Chantelou, sieur de Chambray (1606 - 1676)  French writer, collector, and a theorist of architecture and the arts.",La perspective d'Euclide,"Euclid's Greek text of the theorems of his Optica, as produced by Jean Pena in 1557, translated to French and accompanied by the translator‚Äôs commentary and demonstrations.","Roland Freart de Chantelou's dedication to the king gives his reason for translating Euclid's <i>Optica<i>: Though his work on geometry had been known, studied, and used for 2000 years, his work on optics was relatively unknown and had never appeared in French. It's importance to and effect on perspective, painting, and architecture required that it be better known. In de Chantelou's long letter to the reader, he gives a summary of the principal aspects of Euclid's theory of optics--the extromission of visual rays and their rectilinear propagation--and presents several ancient and medieval commentator's arguments of its plausibility. In the end,  de Chantelou writes that it makes no difference in which direction rays move--out from or into the eye--their geometry is the same as is their importance to the foundation of perspective, art, and architecture.||de Chantelou presents the 12 axioms and the statements of the 61 theorems as found in Jean Pena's Greek text of 1557, but provides his own demonstrations and commentary. A translation of Euclid's optics is a natural consequence of and support for de Chantelou's more famous work, <i>IdeÃÅe de la perfection de la peinture deÃÅmonstreÃÅe par les principes de l'art<i>, published in 1662. They are sometimes found bound together.
","In de Chantelou's long letter to the reader he presents Euclid's Greek text as having come down from Theon of Alexandria and adopted by several ancient and medieval commentators.  de Chantelou notes that Euclid's 12 axioms are contested by 'the Moderns' but are reconsidered in light of practical considerations that make them plausible. The basic Euclidian idea of rectilinear visual rays being emitted by the eye as the foundation for vision is presented as plausible in that is explains several common experiences. These include visual size being proportional to the angle of visual rays apprehending an object and the difficulty of seeing a needle on the ground. The latter is presented as speaking against the idea that objects forming images in the eye, since such a needle is often not found in one glance. Repeated looking is usually required, supporting the idea that eventually visual rays strike the needle and it is visually apprehended. This would not be case if apprehension were image-based, since any glance would provide an image of the needle. That de Chantelou presents this and other visual experiences that support Euclid's ideas arises from his attachment to the knowledge and sense of the ancients. A kind of epistemological piety. In the end, de Chantelou states it doesn't matter in which direction rays move, since the geometry is the same and so the laws of perception and linear perspective are unchanged.||He presents the 12 axioms and text of the 61 theorems as found in Jean Pena's Greek of 1557, but does not translate the demonstrations; rather, he provides his own. They are longer and more descriptive than those of the Greek text, rely heavily on the 12 axioms, and use his own figures.","Les traductions fran√ßaises des ≈ìuvres d'Euclide|Lacoarret, M.|<i>Revue d'histoire des sciences et de leurs applications<i>, Vol 10, No 1, 1957,  pp 38-58.||Liber de visu : The Greco-Latin Translation of Euclid's Optics|Theisen, W.R.|<i>Mediaeval Studies<i>, Vol 41, 1979, pp 44-105.||ùëª The Optics of Euclid|Burton, H.E., translator|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i>, Vol 46, No 5, 1945, pp 357-372.||<i>From Sight to Light<i>|Smith, A.M.|University of Chicago Press, 2015, 457 pp, NB: pp 47-64.||Jean Pean (1528-58) and Stoic Physics in the Sixteenth Century|Barker, P.|<i>The Southern Journal of Philosophy<i>, 1985, Vol XXIII, Supplement||<i>Change and Continuity in Early Modern Cosmology<i>|Boner, P.J., editor|Spring, 2011, 181 pp, NB: pp 40-48.||The Challenge of Applied Optics|In:<i>The Unmaking of the Medieval Christian Cosmos, 1500‚Äì1760<i>|Randles, W.G.L.|Routledge, 2016, 295 pp.||Atmospheric Refraction and the Ramus Circle: Aspects of a Late Sixteenth-Century Dispute|Peoux, G.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 67, No 4 , 2010, pp 457-484.||Peripatetic and Euclidean theories of the visual ray|Jones, A.|<i>Physis<i>, Vol 31, No 1, 1994, pp 47-76.","La perspective d'Euclide, traduite Francois sur le texte Grec, Original de L'Autheur, et demonstree par Rol.

Johann Christoph Kohlhans,"Kohlhans, Johann Christoph",,1604-1677," ",Tractatus Opticus,"Extensive, primarily practical compendium of optics with topics and content extracted from mediaeval and contemporary authors, accompanied by glosses and additions.","Johann Kohlhans makes it clear in his letter to the reader his reasons and methods for writing the <i>Tractatus Opticus<i>. He states that that the study of optics is not only pleasant but useful. Kohlhans writes: 'In times of war and peace, much damage arises from an ignorance of optics.' He cites the many developments in optics and the need for an understanding of them, mentioning the camera obscura, the telescopes, the microscope, mirrors of various forms, lenses, color, and the theories of vision. To this end, he writes, he had been assembling for several years‚Äô material for a new book. He makes no claim to originality, but rather to completeness, citing many authors and works from which he drew his material.  The result is an extensive, primarily practical and descriptive compendium of optics with topics and content extracted from mediaeval and contemporary authors, with a small amount of Aristotelian theory. Subjects include: light, color, vision, and perception; catoptrics; dioptrics; mixed reflection and refraction, the rainbow; ocular anatomy and function; camera obscura; lenses; Telescopes; Microscopes. The section on the camera obscura is the most extensive. The book as the form of extended extracts from and glosses on other texts, making it something of a 'guide to the literature.' Presentation is entirely qualitative; no mathematics or figures accompany the descriptions.
","The <i>Tractaus Opticus<i> is in three books.  Book 1 is in five parts: Part 1, definitions and parts of optics; Part 2 on optics including vision, light, color, perception, and shadow; Part 3 on catoptrics covers reflection, type of mirrors, and burning mirrors; Part 4 on anaclastics or refraction, including refracted vision, magnification, Part 5 on mixed refraction and reflection, including images, the rainbow, and coronae.||Book 2 is in two parts. Part 1 presents additional detail to material in Book 1, including ocular anatomy, theories of light and color, convex and concave mirrors, the nature of refraction, and refraction in a sphere. Part 2 covers the camera obscura, including its function, the use of a lens, and the use of the camera obscura as an instrument for drawing and for astronomy. Kohlhans devotes 60 pages to the camera obscura, making this one of the book's longest sections. Kohlhans cites Christoph Scheiner for the camera obscure as a model for the function of the eye.||Book 3 in in two parts. Part 1 is on lenses, including glass, the types and figures of lenses, and lens making. Part 2 in on 'Optical Tubes' and is in three sections. Section 1 is on the telescope, including the types and forms of telescopes, lenses for telescopes, construction of telescopes. Section 2 is on the helioscope, the microscope, and the polemoscope. Section 3 is on the astronomical Galilean telescopes, how they are made, and how they are used.||Kohlanns sources include summaries such as Ambrosius Rhode's Optica of 1661 from which Kohlans acquires Keplerian optics and Niccol√≤ Zucchi's <i>Optica Philosophia<i> of 1652, collections such as Johann Wecker's <i>De Secretis<i> of 1582 and Georg Philipp Harsd√∂rffer's <i>Deliti√¶ Mathematic√¶ et Physic√¶<i> of 1651, specialized works like Scheiner's <i>Oculus<i> of 1619, and books of practice such as Anton Schyrleus de Rheita's <i>Oculus Enoch et Eliae<i> of 1645 and Johannes Hevelius' <i>Selenographia<i> of 1647. From these and other works, Kohlhans either gives a summary or extracts sections, some of considerable length, to which he adds explanatory glosses and his own expansions.

"Jean Francois Niceron, OM","Niceron, Jean Francois OM",,1613-1646,"Edited by Gilles Personne de Roberval (1602-1675) French mathematician, founding member of the French Academy of Sciences.",La Perspective Curieuse,"Roberval's editing of the final, augmented text on anamorphosis produced by Niceron and overseen by Mersenne.","Jean-Francois Niceron's <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> is a detailed, geometrically practical guide to anamorphosis. That is, the production of distorted perspective images on plane or curved surfaces that require special mirrors or viewing points. For Niceron, optics as an illusionist art, rather than a science of light and vision. As the title implies, Niceron considered anamorphosis a type of perspective, engaging the question of visual representation and the reliability of the visual sense. In his Letter to the Reader, Niceron lists the great developers of and contributors to the science of perspective but notes how few books on the subject do little more than display figures and scenes, without showing in detail how they were produced. He states that his goal is to remedy that for readers of French and that the title, Curious Perspective, could also have been Artificial Magic--'The one that produces for us the most beautiful and admirable effects, bringing about the art and industry of man.' He cautions new readers not to skip the initial material on geometry or the initial drawing exercises. Published when he was 25, Niceron had been working on anamorphosis (direct, catoptric, and dioptric) since he was 18 and a novice in the Order of Minims, and so the work is that of a practitioner with a deep understanding of geometry, not that of just a theoretician. With La Perspective Curieuse, Niceron makes significant advances in perspective projection methods from his predecessors Salomon de Caus and Jean-Louis Vaulezard. This is particularly the case for spherical projection; without Niceron's technique, interior dome work would have been beyond the ability of virtually all painters. This aspect of Niceron's work also affected the design of instruments, such as astrolabes and globes. La Perspective Curieuse was an acknowledged influence on Emmanuel Maignan's Horographia of 1648 and Charles Plumier's l' Art de Tourner en Perfection of 1749.||The plates were engraved by Joan Blanchin, based on Niceron‚Äôs drawings. Editions appeared in 1638 and edited by Roberval in 1651 and 1663. Niceron's Latin translation, <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i>, edited by Mersenne, appeared posthumously in 1646 and edited by Roberval in 1663.
","Jean-Francois Niceron's  <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> begins with a Geometric Preliminaries, followed by four books. The Preliminaries set out geometric basics in 7 Propositions. Book 1: Principles of Perspective. Describes a general method for the linear perspective of solid figures, included the complex cases where the figures contact the horizontal plane only along a line or at a point. The process is fundamentally geometric and presented in 15 Propositions, each demonstrated with one or more figures. Examples of the process are give for several solid objects. Book 2: Planar Anamorphosis. Projections are introduced for distorting a regular image so that it appears undistorted only when viewed from a particular viewing point. The undistorted rectangular grid of the image is mapped into a grid distorted by projection. The process is presented in 7 Propositions accompanied by figures. Book 3: Anamorphosis with Cylindrical and Conical Mirrors. Five Propositions and figures present the method for generating a doubly-projected grid. The rectangular grid of an image is mapped onto the projection and an undistorted view is presented only the appropriate mirror. Niceron gives practical advice on metal-casting for mirrors and instructions for their polishing. Book 4: Dioptric Anamorphosis. Five Propositions give the method for generating a projected grid that separate and distorts an image into several pieces. The projection depends on the nature of the intended facetted, dioptrical viewer. The rectangular grid of an image is segregated and distorted according to projected grid and reveals an assembled and undistorted image when viewed with the required facetted dioptric element. The material in all four books is presented with a brevity that requires close reading and careful reference to the many figures in the plates.","Roberval ¬´√©diteur¬ª de Mersenne et du P.

Like the earlier version, it is a detailed, geometrically practical guide to anamorphosis. That is, the production of distorted perspective images on plane or curved surfaces that require viewing points. As the Latin title implies, Niceron came to consider anamorphosis a type of natural magic or wonder-working. In his Preface to the reader, Niceron set out his plan for reworking the text of 1638: A section giving the principles of geometry followed by revised books one and two, and these followed by a section on a new scenographic instrument and an appendix on Light and Shadow. There was to be a second part containing revisions of books three and four of the 1638 text on catoptric and dioptric anamorphosis. Niceron worked on the <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i> for eight years after the publication of 1638 but his early death in 1646 prevented him from completing what was to be the second half of the work. His fellow Minim member Marin Mersenne edited the manuscript. Niceron's plan must have been fixed from the start, for the revised book one contains references to books three and four. The geometric prelude that precedes Book One is a close Latin translation of the French original. The reworked Books One and Two are considerable expansions of the originals, with more theorems, propositions, and detail.||Niceron had continued to work on practical anamorphosis and the <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i> since <i>La Perspective Curieuse<i> of 1638, and so his experience had deepened the detail and examples he brought to the revised work was considerably richer. In 1638 the first two books were accompanied by 10 plates of figures, in 1646 by 35 plates. The last eight plates are devoted to Niceron's scenography and his appendix on light and shadow. The title frontispiece was drawn by Simon Vouet and engraved by Charles Audran. The portrait, executed by Michel Lane, shows Niceron not long before his death.||With Thaumaturgus Opticus, Niceron's significant advances in perspective projection methods over his predecessors Salomon de Caus and Jean-Louis Vaulezard are more developed and reach a wider audience. Edited by Mersenne, it appeared posthumously in 1646 and edited by Roberval in 1663.
","Jean-Francois Niceron's  <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus<i> begins with Geometric Preliminaries, followed by two books on anamorphosis, then a description of a scenographic instrument, and ends with an appendix on light and shadow. The Preliminaries set out geometric basics in 8 Propositions and two appendices. Book 1: Principles of Perspective. Describes a general method for the linear perspective of solid figures, included the complex cases where the figures contact the horizontal plane only along a line or at a point. The process is fundamentally geometric and presented in 12 axioms, 37 Propositions, and a synopsis. Each proposition is demonstrated with one or more figures. Examples of the process are give for several solid objects. Book 2: Planar Anamorphosis. Projections are introduced for distorting a regular image so that it appears undistorted only when viewed from a particular viewing point. The undistorted rectangular grid of the image is mapped into a grid distorted by projection. The process is presented in 12 Propositions accompanied by figures. The material in both books is presented with a brevity that requires close reading and careful reference to the many figures in the plates. The Universal Scenograph describes a device of Niceron's invention that allows by direct viewing the drawing of an object in linear or anamorphic projection. It operates as an optical-mechanical equivalent of Durer's perspective grid. The Appendix on Light and Shadow demonstrates techniques for drawing shadows in linear perspective. Interestingly, it includes not only umbral shadows from point light sources but also penumbral shadows from area light sources such as windows.

Pierre Petit,"Petit, Pierre",,1617-1687," ",Ignis et Lucis Natura,"A defense of Aristotelian teachings on light and fire, attacking the work of Isaac Voss
","Petit wrote in defense of Aristotle: a fierce anti-Cartesian who defended peripatetic doctrines. He wrote this brief work to set out his objections to Isaac Voss's ideas on light and vision, particularly concerning the nature of light and fire, questioning the way fire might affect the soul. Though Voss was no Cartesian, he was not an Aristotelian either. In his view he himself had gained a novel insight in the understanding of visual perception that exceeded conceptual differences between ancients and moderns. Voss responded to his critics point by point, but they had not in any way changed his opinion.||With the appearance of Descartes' <i>Principia Philosophiae Specimina<i> in 1644, Cartesianism began to displace Aristotelianism in scholarly circles and university curricula. Petit and his <i>Ignis et Lucis Natura<i> is an example of the defense that was mounted by traditional Aristotelians.",Petit's text is in the form of 33 exercises. Each is considers a separate aspects of fire and light and shows how Aristotelian teaching explains observations within a consistent framework.

The section on vision distinguishes between lux and lumen, presents a Galenic ocular anatomy, and a hyriid scholastic-Cartesian processes that brings about vision. An attempt to bridge Aristotelian and Cartesian natural philosophy.
","Friedemann Bechmann's letter to the reader makes it clear why he wrote the <i>Systema Physicum<i>. It was at the request of Prince Ernest of Saxony and to fill the need for a single book that brought most of physics together. Bechmann points out the new developments in physics that need to be taught and, in this regard, mentions specifically that the book has been prepared for use in the Gymnasium at Gotha. Bechmann's text covers general and particular physics, meteorics, minerals, plants, animals, and man. Written on the cusp of the transition from Aristotelian to Cartesian natural philosophy, Bechmann's text is an example of the teaching material developed to bridge the gap. The bulk of the treatment is Aristotelian, but in many cases (such as meteorics, light and vision) Bechmann describes the Cartesian alternative. But Descartes is not singled out--Gassendi and Voss are also cited in this way.||Editions appeared at Jena in 1664, 1675, 1681, and 1683.

Boyle concluded that colors from objects are not different from those produced by prisms or the rainbow.
","Like many natural philosophers of the time, Robert Boyle was interested in color. For some years he had conducted various experiments involving light and color, recording the results in various forms and places. Pressed by friends, he returned to these separate pieces of years earlier and assembled them into an essay for private circulation, eventually appearing in print. Boyle recognized that he had not produced a general theory of color, but rather had assembled experimental results from which such a theory might be built. For that reason, his title is, in part, and expression of his purpose: <i>The Beginning of an Experimental History of Colours<i>.  The publisher, for his part considers the work more than a beginning: 'I think it so well begun, that the work is more than half dispactcht.'||Boyle recognized he had not written a popular account of color, but something for other natural philosophers:   '‚Ä¶ for my part, I had much rather deserve the thanks of the Ingenious, than enjoy the Applause of the Ignorant.' He separated his Experiments and Considerations into three parts, the first giving a general summary of what was know about color, the second presenting the results of his extensive study of white and black, and the third records the results of more than 50 various experiments. These experiments were not limited to strictly optical phenomena, but, being a chemist, often involved the changing, appearance, and disappearance of colors in various chemical experiments. Importantly, Boyle's experiment had him conclude there was no difference between prismatic colors, colors of objects, colors from meteorological phenomena, and colors of pigments and glass.||It is known that Newton read Boyle's <i>Experiments and Considerations<i> when he began his own optical experiments around 1665 and that Boyle's book was the earliest and most influential of Newton's early sources. Editions appeared at London in 1664 and 1670, and Latin translations appeared at London in 1665, at Amsterdam in 1667, at Rotterdam in 1671, at Geneva in 1680, and in the Collected Works of 1744. An edition revised by John Hoofnail appeared at London in 1738.
","Robert Boyle's <i>Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours<i> is a monologue addressed to 'Pyrophilus' and contains three parts. Part I is presentation of then-current knowledge about color and has five chapters covering Boyle's method and reason for experimentation, the general lack of experimental information about color, review of then-current color information and properties, the distinction between real and apparent colors, size color hypotheses rejected by Boyle. Part II presents an extended study and assessment of White and Black in two chapters. Here Boyle rejects the old idea that color arises from the mixing of white and black, properties of whiteness drawn from objects in nature, properties of blackness including it heat-holding properties. The part ends with a description of 15 experiments conducted on whiteness and blackness. Part III presents the results of 50 experiments related to color, including color perception, optical and prismatic colors, colors in chemistry, pigment colors, color from adding colored lights.||Boyle briefly summarizes the color theories of the Scholastics, Neoplatonists, Epicureans, and the Cartesians--and finds them all wanting. Importantly, his own idea is that color is light itself that has been modified in some way. He is aware of the vast array of color phenomena involving optics, chemistry, natural history, color in gems, phosphoric colors, and color phenomena that appear to be purely perceptual, and cannot conceive of a theoretical mechanism to explain them all. But his is more certain about his notions regarding whiteness and blackness: whiteness being produced by the surface of an object that consists of tiny surfaces the reflect most incident light into many directions, and blackness being produced by a surface that does not reflect light but absorbs it. Several of his experiments are conducted to demonstrates these ideas, particularly those involving the heating of black surfaces in sunlight. Importantly, Boyle considers whiteness and blackness a result of reflection and absorption, and not as primitives of color that are responsible in some fashion for their generation.||The text includes an appendix of observations Boyle made with a diamond that was said to be phosphorescent.","‚ÅÇ On Reading Boyle's 'Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours'|Kuehni, R.G.|<i>Color Research and Application<i>, Vol 18, No 3, pp 193-196.||Isaac Newton: The Rise of a Scientist 1661-1671|Lohne.

Rene Descartes,"Descartes, Rene",,1596-1650," ",Le Monde,"Posthumous publication of an early work on all of natural philosophy and intended as the first part of a work on the World and Man. The section on Light, the longest by far, would later be reworked to become the essay La Dioptrique, part of the Discours de La M√©thode of 1637.
","Ren√© Descartes' Treatise on Light--published as <i>Le Monde<i>--had it roots in what has been called his micro-mechanical conception of natural philosophy--all physical action, activity, or result was generated, transmitted, or sensed by means of the interaction of particulate matter. He referred to this as 'physico-mathematics' and was his replacement for Scholastic teachings in natural philosophy. Optics was a life-long interest of Descartes, and his earliest study was that of refraction, written in 1619-1921. The first full expression of these and other ideas was his <i>La Monde<i>, which he began in 1629 and had nearly completed by 1633 but abandoned due to the shock created by the condemnation of Galileo in that year. The text ends with an unfinished 15th chapter. When Descartes heard of the condemnation wrote to Mersenne of his surprise, the difficulty of removing the Copernican elements of his treatise, and his decision not to publish: '... I wouldn't want to publish a discourse which had a single word that the Church disapproved of; so, I prefer to suppress it rather than publish it in a mutilated form.' The work was not published in his lifetime.||Treatise on Light set out Descartes' theory of light, described vortex celestial mechanics, and advanced a Copernican cosmography; all based on a fundamentally mechanical view of physics. Even sense perception was described in terms of mechanical interaction. During the time Descartes was writing the Treatise on Light, he was deeply involved in geometrical optics including his work on making lenses of hyperbolic figure. The optical material in Treatise on Light would eventually appear in the essay La Dioptrique and Les Meteores, with all Copernican cosmography removed. The cosmological material appeared with much hedging and indirection in the <i>Principia Philosophia<i> of 1644.||The text of <i>Le Monde<i> was edited by Claude Clerselier (1614-1684) who added without attribution G√©rauld de Cordemoy‚Äôs <i>Discours ‚Ä¶touchant le mouvement et le repos<i>. The Treatise on Light was published as <i>Le Monde de Mr. Descartes ou le Trait√© de la Lumi√®re in Paris <i> in 1664 with different title pages, one by Jacques LeGras and another by Michel Bobin & Nicolar LeGras. There is another issue with a the title page of Theodore Gira[r]d also dated 1664. The Treatise on Light together with his essay <i>L'Homme<i> appeared at Paris in 1677 and 1726, and at Paris in the editions of the Oeuvres des Descartes of 1824 and 1897.
","<i>Le Monde des Mr. Descartes<i>, the posthumously published version of his Treatise on Light, contains 15 chapters. The first five set out Descartes view of the mechanical basis for all of natural philosophy. In these, he refutes Scholastic teachings regarding the nature of sense perceptions in general and those from light in particular. It is here he introduces his mechanical theory of the nature of light and mechanisms of sense perception. Descartes then presents a mechanistic view of fluids and air and in chapter 5 explains how fire, air, and earth are involved in the generation, propagation, and reflection and refraction of light: generation by fire, propagation by pressure in fluids, and reflection and refraction by terrestrial objects.||Chapters 6 and 7 present Descartes three laws of motion and inertia: conservation of states of bodies (size, motion, rest, position), conservation of the 'force of motion' of bodies, and the constancy of rectilinear direction of motion. Chapters 8-12 use the theory of matter developed in chapters 1-5 and the laws of motion and inertia in 6 and 7 to develop a Copernican cosmography based on vortices, fluids, and mechanical interaction. Chapters 13-15 deal with physical optics and, using his theory of matter and laws of motion, and the properties of the 'tendency to motion' of closely-packed particles, explain light's rectilinear propagation, specular reflection, and refraction.||As with his later writings, Descartes' presentation is based more on analogy than on analysis, particularly regarding the nature of light and it propagation.","ùëª <i>Le Monde,¬†ou Traite de la Lumiere.¬†Translation and introduction<i>|Mahoney, M.

","The origin of Grandorge's <i>Natura Ignis, Lucis, et Colorum<i> is the sparing between Pierre-Daniel Huet, a close acquaintance of Grandorge, and Isaac Voss.  In 1658 Voss published a commentary on Pomponius Mela's <i>Chorographia<i> including attempts to explain what Mela recorded being seen by mountain top residents' and sailors' reports of 'atmospheric fire.'  Huet published objections to Voss's ideas regarding refraction and in 1662 Voss published <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i>, an extended response to Huet. Huet did not respond, but Grandorge, his colleague did. The central issue was the nature of refraction. Voss would publish a response to Grandorge in the form of the <i>Appendix ad Scriptum de Natura et Proprietate Lucis<i>, added at the end of his <i>De Nili<i> of 1666. Nineteen Observations on light and color are stated and defended. Voss's <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> of 1662 is quoted and refuted extensively, along with Gassendi and Descartes.

Generally, Grandorge refutes Voss's conception of light, focusing on the latter's comparison of light and fire. Contrary to Voss, Grandorge asserted that light is a non-corporeal emanation and color is held to be a mix of white ('maximum color') and black ('minimum color').

Boyle recognized that he had not produced a general theory of color, but rather had assembled experimental results from which such a theory might be built. For that reason, his title is, in part, and expression of his purpose: <i>The Beginning of an Experimental History of Colours<i>.  The publisher, for his part considers the work more than a beginning: 'I think it so well begun, that the work is more than half dispactcht.'||Boyle recognized he had not written a popular account of color, but something for other natural philosophers:   '‚Ä¶ for my part, I had much rather deserve the thanks of the Ingenious, than enjoy the Applause of the Ignorant.' He separated his Experiments and Considerations into three parts, the first giving a general summary of what was know about color, the second presenting the results of his extensive study of white and black, and the third records the results of more than 50 various experiments. These experiments were not limited to strictly optical phenomena, but, being a chemist, often involved the changing, appearance, and disappearance of colors in various chemical experiments. Importantly, Boyle's experiment had him conclude there was no difference between prismatic colors, colors of objects, colors from meteorological phenomena, and colors of pigments and glass.||It is known that Newton read Boyle's <i>Experiments and Considerations<i> when he began his own optical experiments around 1665 and that Boyle's book was the earliest and most influential of Newton's early sources. This is a very close Latin translation of the English text of 1664. Editions appeared at London in 1664 and 1670, and Latin translations appeared at London in 1665, at Amsterdam in 1667, at Rotterdam in 1671, at Geneva in 1680, and in the Collected Works of 1744. An edition revised by John Hoofnail appeared at London in 1738.
","Robert Boyle's <i>Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours<i> is a monologue addressed to 'Pyrophilus' and contains three parts. Part I is presentation of then-current knowledge about color and has five chapters covering Boyle's method and reason for experimentation, the general lack of experimental information about color, review of then-current color information and properties, the distinction between real and apparent colors, size color hypotheses rejected by Boyle. Part II presents an extended study and assessment of White and Black in two chapters. Here Boyle rejects the old idea that color arises from the mixing of white and black, properties of whiteness drawn from objects in nature, properties of blackness including it heat-holding properties. The part ends with a description of 15 experiments conducted on whiteness and blackness. Part III presents the results of 50 experiments related to color, including color perception, optical and prismatic colors, colors in chemistry, pigment colors, color from adding colored lights.||Boyle briefly summarizes the color theories of the Scholastics, Neoplatonists, Epicureans, and the Cartesians--and finds them all wanting. Importantly, his own idea is that color is light itself that has been modified in some way. He is aware of the vast array of color phenomena involving optics, chemistry, natural history, color in gems, phosphoric colors, and color phenomena that appear to be purely perceptual, and cannot conceive of a theoretical mechanism to explain them all. But his is more certain about his notions regarding whiteness and blackness: whiteness being produced by the surface of an object that consists of tiny surfaces the reflect most incident light into many directions, and blackness being produced by a surface that does not reflect light but absorbs it. Several of his experiments are conducted to demonstrates these ideas, particularly those involving the heating of black surfaces in sunlight. Importantly, Boyle considers whiteness and blackness a result of reflection and absorption, and not as primitives of color and responsible in some fashion for their generation.||The text includes an appendix of observations Boyle made with a diamond that was said to  be phosphorescent.","‚ÅÇ On Reading Boyle's 'Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours'|Kuehni, R.G.|<i>Color Research and Application<i>, Vol 18, No 3, pp 193-196.||Isaac Newton: The Rise of a Scientist 1661-1671|Lohne.

Fifth of Six volumes, covering Mixed Mathematics, including optics. A textbook in the Scholastic manner and an example of the Jesuit opposition to Descartes. 
","Pierre Gaultruche taught mathematics at the Jesuit schools at La Fl√®che and Caens and it was at this time that he produced this compendium-textbook for use in his courses. In is broad scope, coverage, and level of detail, it was like other compendia of the time: Claude Milliet Dechales' <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> of 1674 or William Leybourne's <i>Cursus Mathematics<i> of 1690. Though committed to Scholastic teachings, Gaultruche was an eclectic Aristotelian; as seen in the mix of theories he presented in physics and mixed mathematics. Topics in Mixed Mathematics are covered in a series of Disputations, with a section on light, color, and vision presenting both the Scholastic and the Keplerian theory of vision.

","Fifth volume of second edition of a six-volume textbook in the Scholastic manner and an example of the Jesuit opposition to Descartes. Topics in Mixed Mathematics are covered in a series of Disputations, with a section on light, color, and vision. The 'Mathematica' volume consists of nine parts: arithmetic, elements of geometry, practical geometry, world sphere, chronology, gnomonics, terrestrial sphere, optics and music. The optics material is brief (30 pages) and deals only with vision and images. Geometric or physical optics is not presented, nor is Descartes' La Dioptrique cited or used. Ocular anatomy is briefly presented and then, strangely, both the Scholastic and Keplerian theory of vision is presented. The former detailing how species of light color are emitted from an object, enter the eye, and impinge on the crystalline lens. The later showing how the lens forms images on the retina which sends information via the optics nerves to the brain. Conditions necessary for distinct vision are presented including the cause of near and far-sightedness, and brief presentations on the camera obscura and catoptric anamorphosis are made.

Francesco Maria Grimaldi,"Grimaldi, Francesco Maria",,1618-1663," ","Physico-mathesis de lumine, coloribus, et iride","Experiments, measurements, and mathematics on light's nature and propagation are described in 60 Propositions. It is proposed that light is a subtle fluid, colors arise from variations in its vibrations, and diffraction be added to light's direct, reflective, and refractive propagation.","The origin of Grimaldi's <i>Physico-mathesis de Lumine, Coloribus, et Iride<i> was his work in astronomy with Giovanni Battista Riccioli at the Collegio di Santa Lucia in Bologna. Grimaldi had used a form of the camera obscura to measure the sizes of the sun and moon and had noticed discrepancies, particularly with small apertures, even after the corrections for aperture size recommended by Kepler in his <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604. This, among other problems, convinced Grimaldi that the nature of light had not been established and experiments were required. The Prooemium makes clear he intended to report on such experiments, conducted to determine the nature of light, color, and the rainbow. In 1658 Grimaldi began experimenting and generating results that would appear in the <i>Physico-mathesis de Lumine, Coloribus, et Iride<i>. The manuscript was finished in December 1661 and submitted to Jesuit censors--apparently with only what finally became Book 1. Publication was denied and Grimaldi added the second, Peripatetic book, and completed further revision just before he died in December 1663. The final text was approved by Provincial, rather than Roman, Jesuit auditors in May of 1664.||The first and much longer book presents 60 propositions and describes experiments that support them. The second, much shorter book, presents 6 propositions that give the Peripatetic theory of light and color. Grimaldi's book was published after his death, the dedication written by the printer and the Prooemium presumably coming from his notes. The book was described and reviewed in the January 1671 Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Grimaldi's discovery and description of diffraction became widely known, but the rest of the book appears to have had little influence. Grimaldi plumped for light being a vibratory phenomenon in a subtle fluid, but this would eventually be overshadowed by the Newtonian idea of corpuscles.
","The <i>Physico-mathesis de Lumine, Coloribus, et Iride<i> is in two Books. Book 1 presents 60 Propositions, supported by experiments and measurements, on light's nature and propagation, diffraction,  the nature of transparent objects, refraction, color and the rainbow. For balance, or to satisfy the censors, Book 2 to gives 6 Propositions on the Peripatetic teaching that light is and accident of a substance that has had its potential transparency actualized. The 60 Propositions of Book 1 are arranged as follows. Propositions 1-3 one the nature of light, its direct, reflect, refracted, and diffracted propagation. Propositions 4-9 on the nature of transparency. Proposition 10-24 on the substantial nature of light. Propositions 25-27 on images and the camera obscura. Propositions 28-42 on the nature and cause of color. Propositions 43-45 on vision and color. Propositions 46-60 on the rainbow. Several of these propositions are accompanied by descriptions of experiments. The most important of these involve slit apertures and narrow sunbeams projecting diffraction fringes and colors, and those involving prisms and water-filled globes showing the mechanisms of the rainbow.||Book 1 proposes and defends the idea that light is a subtle fluid, that colors arise from variations in its vibrations, and that diffraction be added to light's direct, reflective, and refractive propagation. Diffraction is the fluid being 'split apart' by an object's edge. For balance, or to satisfy the censor, six more propositions are added at the end to give the Scholastic view of light as accident of a transparent substance. In the last propositions, Grimaldi's presents a very clear, detailed, and extensive  exposition of the formation of the primary and secondary rainbows, and adds that the rainbow, under suitable refraction and reflection, 'can appear double, or even triple, etc.' This is the first reference to and support for the reality of the tertiary rainbow. The material is devoted entirely to physical optics. Aside from brief considerations of the operation of single lenses, geometric optics is not considered.

Honor√© Fabri,"Fabri, Honor√©",,1608-1688," ",Tractatus Duo,"Tracts on Plants and Humans. In the latter, a thirty-five-page section describes ocular anatomy, physiology of vision, binocular vision, a few aspects of visual perception, operation of the Galilean and Keplerian telescopes, optical illusions, and ends with various questions and answers.","Honor√© Fabri wrote the <i>Tractatus Duo<i> after he had been stationed in Rome for 15 years and following a long period of study. The book marked the start of his most productive period of publications on natural philosophy. The <i>Tractatus Due<i>--two tracts, one on plants the other on Man--was well received and prompted Fabri to revive his writing and publishing efforts that had stopped when he was sent to Rome in 1648. In the second tract, a thirty-five-page section describes ocular anatomy, physiology of vision, binocular vision, a few aspects of visual perception, operation of the Galilean and Keplerian telescopes, distinct and indistinct vision, and ends with various optical and perception questions and answers. While adhering to a general Aristotelianism, Fabri incorporates Keplerian and Cartesian ideas, producing a hybrid that is forward-looking but sails close to the wind of Jesuit conservatism. Some the optical material appearing here would be developed in expanded form in Fabri's <i>Synopsis Optica<i> of 1667 and the <i>Dialogi Physici<i> of 1669.
","The second <i>Tractatus, De Homine<i>, has seven books. Book 1, the vegetative and generation faculties of man. Books 2, The senses in general and the exterior senses. Book 3, The interior senses. Book 4, Animal and natural motion. Book 5, The appetitive sense. Book 6. The affections of man including indolence, temperament, life, and death. Book 7, The rational soul.||The optics material is presented in the context of Fabri's analysis of the 'external senses,' which is the subject of Book 2. Propositions 1-52 deal with the senses in general, the nature of sense objects, and perceptions from the senses. Propositions 53-58 deal briefly with the senses of touch, taste, smell,  and hearing. Proposition 59-97 deal with optics and vision and describe ocular anatomy, physiology of vision, binocular vision, a few aspects of visual perception, operation of the Galilean and Keplerian telescopes, and optical illusions. The 97th and last proposition presents various questions and answers.||The ocular anatomy is modern, with the seat of vision ascribed to the retina onto which objects impress images by way of Lumen. Distinct and indistinct vision is ascribed to images not impressed properly on the retina. Fabri also acknowledges the role of Francois Aguilon's Horopter in distinct vision as well as giving the analogy of the camera obscura for the function of the eye. Binocular vision is explained in Proposition 93, proposing that vision presents a single perception from two eyes because points on the object are projected 'onto the same spot on each retina.' Dioptrics is presented with detail just sufficient to explain the function of the eye's crystalline lens and the operation of the Galilean and Keplerian telescopes. The issue of the nature of light is not addressed and is avoided throughout with the artifice of using 'visual rays' in all demonstrations and expositions, rather than light rays. The 20 questions and answers in Proposition 97 deal with several aspects of the eye, visual perception, lenses, and the telescope. The book contains a single plate of 10 figures, all of which are devoted to vision and optics.","La philosophie naturelle d‚ÄôHonor√© Fabri (1607-1688)|Roux, S.|In: <i>Les J√©suites √† Lyon<i>|√âFouilloux, √â., Hours, B., editors|ENS √âditions, Lyon, 2005, 275 pp, NB pp 75-94.||Aristotelianism More Geometrico: Honor√© Fabri|Paul Richard Blum, P.R.|In: <i>Studies in Early Modern Aristotelianism<i>, Brill, 2012, 366 pp, NB: pp 199-216.||Deux essais de renouvellement de la Scolastique au XVIIe si√®cle.

Isaac Voss,"Voss, Isaac",Isaac Vossius,1618-1689," ",Ad Scriptum de nature et proprietate lucis,"A rebuttal to critics and clarification of the ideas regarding light and refraction presented in the <i>De Lucis Natura<i> of 1662.
","Isaac Voss' <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> has its origins with Voss' study of the optical phenomena reported by  Pomponius Mela involving the sea, the atmosphere, and the rising sun. In his commentary on Mela of 1658, Voss added an extended note offering an explanation for the phenomena. In doing so he set down several controversial claims that departed significantly from generally accepted ideas. The most bumptious of which was that refraction does not take place only at the interface between two media of different densities, but rather continuously throughout a medium. The denser the medium, the more pronounced the continuous refraction. The most important and detailed response to Voss' claims was from Pierre-Daniel Huet, Voss' friend, colleague in philology, and cleric-scholar from Caen. Huet objected to Voss claims about the atmosphere and how it refracts, but most strenuously to the claim that refraction is continuous in a medium. The <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> is essentially an extended reply to Huet's objections. In it, the treatment of optics is based on visual perception and images, rather than Keplerian ray propagation. That is, from visual phenomena Voss deduces physical phenomena, rather than the other way around. Though an anti-Cartesian, Voss was not an Aristotelian--he had developed his own peculiar ideas regarding optics.||The <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> contains Voss' recounting of his examination of a manuscript of Willebrord Snell and that he discovered the sine law of refraction before Descartes and its appearance in his <i>La Dioptrique<i> of 1637. This alone made the book popular. Though widely read, the book's collection of extreme differences from Keplerian and Cartesian optics generated wide-spread negative reaction among Cartesians. One was the publication in 1664 of <i>De Natura Ignis, Lucis et Colorum Dissertatio<i> by Andr√© Graindorge, a close acquaintance of Pierre-Daniel Huet. Voss would publish a response in the form of the <i>Appendix ad Scriptum de Natura et Proprietate Lucis<i>, added at the end of his <i>De Nili<i> of 1666.
","Isaac Voss' <i>De Lucis Natura et Proprietate<i> has 32 Chapters. Chapters 1-4 cover the theory of light, presenting and dismissing both Cartesian and Gassendian ideas, maintaining instead that light is a type of luminous fire. Chapters 5-13 consider non-corporeal rays of light and their motion in vacuum. Chapters 14-23 presents Voss' ideas on continuous refraction, and refraction in air, water, glass objects. It is in chapter 16 that Voss recounts what he learned from examining a manuscript of Willebrord Snell and in chapter 18 that atmospheric refraction is considered. Chapters 24-28 are on color, which is presented as an entity separate from light, the intrinsic 'sulfurous quality' of an object. Chapters 29-32 cover various aspects of visual perception including the appearance of coronae, the apparent size of objects, what refraction does to solar and lunar observations, and refraction in general.||Voss adheres to image formation ideas from Witelo and Alhazen rather than those of ray propagation of Kepler, emphasizing the continuity of optical phenomena that take place throughout a transparent material, and not at (just) its surface. That is, Voss contends that light is continuously interacting with the transparent medium through which it travels, and so refraction is continuous, as appearances in some visual experiments seem to support.","‚ÅÇ A View from the Mountaintop: The Development of Isaac Vossius' Optics, 1658-1666|Dijksterhus, F.J.|In: <i>Isaac Vossius (1618-1689) between Science and Scholarship<i>, Brill, Leiden, 2012, pp 159-187.||De kleurtheorie van de Aristotelianen en de opvattingen van De la Chambre, Dulianiel en Vossius in de periode 1640-1670|MacLean, J.|<i>Scientiarum Historia<i>, Vol 10, 1968, pp 209-225.",Appendix Ad scriptum de nature et proprietate lucis,On a Letter Concerning the Nature and Properties of Light,Latin,1666,1650-1675,"Dutch scholar, linguist, libraian, and book collector on a grand scale.

Honor√© Fabri,"Fabri, Honor√©",,1608-1688," ",Synopsis Optica,"58 Propositions surveying optics, admitting the practical parts of Descartes optics, but rejecting the theoretical and keeping Aristotelian ideas. The Function and use of microscopes and telescopes are described; the 'field lens' being an original contribution.","The <i>Synopsis Optica<i> of Honor√© Fabri is one of the many texts produced during his years of high productivity, 1665-1680, while stationed in Rome. It incorporates material that had appeared in his <i>Tractatus de Homine<i> of 1666 but is of considerably wider scope and greater detail. It follows the traditional optical trinity--optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics--but side-steps questions in physical optics and the nature of light, dealing almost exclusively with geometric optics.  Ostensibly Aristotelian, its content shows a recognition of the importance of Descartes' optics in matters practical and mathematical but does not adopt any aspect of Descartes' physical optics. The book's scope, level of detail, concision, and lack of advanced or elaborate mathematics, made it useful synopsis; a reasonable reference book and overview. But it lacked examples and could not be and was not used as a textbook. Fabri's grasp of optics was entirely theoretical, he was not a practitioner of any of its arts. This led him to errors, particular regarding the operation of multiple lens systems, which would be pointed out by John Flamsteed and William Molineux. It shows, however, that the <i>Synopsis Optica<i> was read by other opticians.||Fabri had a European reputation at the time and so the <i>Synopsis Optica<i> received reviews--neutral and little more than content summaries--in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Vol 2, No 32, February 1667/8, p 626, and in Le Journal des Scavans, No 14, December 1667, pp 167-168.||This copy with the very rare errata for the <i>Synopsis Optica<i> at the end of the Appendix.
","The <i>Synopsis Optica<i> of Honor√© Fabri has a traditional form, containing 58 Propositions surveying optics, each with demonstrations and corollaries. The general topics are: The eye and vision, Optics, Catoptrics, Dioptrics, Astronomical Applications. Propositions 1-10 survey the eye, visual mechanisms, the nature and function of visual rays, and how they account for perceptions of size and distance of visual objects. Propositions 11-15 give the fundamentals of linear perspective and scenography. Propositions 16-19 discuss vision when objects or the eye are in motion, views through openings, whiteness and lightness, and binocular vision. Propositions 20-24 consider visual species and lumen and how they project through openings, the projection of shadows, and the appearance of Saturn explained by optical principles. Propositions 25-40 give an overview of reflected luminous rays on plane, convex, and concave mirrors. This includes mirrors of spherical, cylindrical, conical, parabolic, elliptical, and hyperbolic figure. A brief explanation of images in mirrors is given. Propositions 41-53 give an overview of refracted luminous rays in water and glass with plane, spherical, elliptical and hyperbolic faces. Telescopes and microscopes are considered, along with color. It is here that Fabri presents his two-lens 'field lens' for use in telescopes. Propositions 54-58 consider refraction and parallax and other celestial optical phenomena and the consequences for cosmogony. An appendix considers the celestial system of Ptolemy and argues for a stationary Earth. Three letters are attached that involve Fabri's ongoing tussles with Huygens and others over the nature and consequences of astronomical observations--particularly those of Saturn.||Fabri maintains a general, if vague, Aristotelianism but admits the practical parts of Keplerian and Cartesian optics. The general question of the nature of light--and most of physical optics--is not dealt with; virtually all the material is geometric optics, using the artifice of 'luminous rays.'

","Pierre Gaultruche taught mathematics at the Jesuit schools at La Fl√®che and Caens and it was at this time that he produced this compendium-textbook for use in his courses. In is broad scope, coverage, and level of detail, it was like other compendia of the time: Claude Milliet Dechales' <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> of 1674 or William Leybourne's <i>Cursus Mathematics<i> of 1690. Though committed to Scholastic teachings, Gaultruche was an eclectic Aristotelian; as seen in the mix of theories he presented in physics and mixed mathematics. Though Kepler or Descartes are not mentioned, Keplerian and Cartesian optics are blended with Aristotelian ideas to form a hybrid of visual species, geometric optics, and image-based vision.||Editions appeared Caens in 1656 and 1665, at Vienna in 1661, and at London in 1683. This is the separate edition of Volume 5, <i>Mathematicae Totius<i>, that appeared at Cambridge in 1668. Used at English universities, it was also the basis for a German science and mathematics popularization that appeared at Ulm in 1695.
","This English textbook extracted 8 of the 9 parts of the fifth volume of Gautruche's six volume work <i>Philosophi√¶ ac Mathematic√¶ Totius Institutio<i> of 1656. in the Scholastic manner, topics in Mixed Mathematics are covered in eight sections, each with a series of disputations: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, chronology, gnomonics, geography, optics, and music.  The optics section covers light and vision. The optics material is brief (30 pages) and deals only with vision and images. There are seven brief chapters: Ocular anatomy; Optical function; Conditions of the eye for vision; Conditions of an object for vision;  Direct, reflected, and refracted vision, briefly mentioning lenses and Galileo's telescope, and images produced by mirrors; Visual perceptions of size, distance, motion, position; Illusions and errors of vision, citing Augilon's <i>Opticorum Libri Sex<i> of 1613. Geometric or physical optics is not presented. Though Descartes' La Dioptrique is not cited, ocular anatomy is covered and then a hybrid of Scholastic, Keplerian, and Cartesian theory of vision is presented. It details how species of light and color are emitted from an object, enter the eye, and impinge on the retina.||The material is elementary and entirely descriptive; no mathematics is involved.","<i>Natural Philosophy in Some Early Seventeenth Century Scholastic Textbooks<i>|Reif, P.M.|St. Louis University, Dissertation, 1962, 365 p.","Mathematicae Totius, Clara, Brevis & Accurata Institutio.

Thomas Hobbes,"Hobbes, Thomas",,1588-1679," ",Opera Philosophica,"Thomas Hobbes' complete works, written in Latin, up to 1668. This includes his works on Man, Matter, Mathematics, Physics, and Politics: <i>De Corpore, De Homine, Leviathen, De Cive, De Natura Aeris et Duplicatione Cubi, Quadratura Circuli, Problemata Physica, De Principis Geometrarum, and Examinatio Mathematiae<i>.","The origins of Thomas Hobbes' writings on optics are his relationship with Marian Mersenne which began in 1635 and his acquisition and study of Ren√© Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i> in 1638. By the early 1640s Hobbes had written what is now known as the <i>Tractatus Opticus I<i> in which contained the essence of his theory of light. His theory was mediumistic and mechanical and inextricably linked to vision: Light was pulsed motion in an aethereal medium produced by a luminous object, the pulses moved through the medium along paths that defined physical rays, the front of which were a type of 'pulse front' that interacted kinematically with objects producing reflection and refraction. The <i>Tractatus Opticus I<i> appeared in edited form in Mersenne‚Äôs <i>Universae Geometriae Mixtaeque Mathematicae Synopsis<i> of 1644. In 1646 Hobbes completed A Minute or First Draught of the Optiques which contained applications of the material in the <i>Tractatus Opticus I<i> and Hobbes' theory of vision. The second part this work, translated into Latin, appeared in published form in <i>De Homine<i> of 1658 and is included in the <i>Opera Philosophica<i>. Some parts of the <i>Tractatus Opticus I<i> were incorporated in <i>De Corpore<i> of 1665, which also appears here. The <i>Opera Philosophica<i> contains all of Hobbes' printed optical works, aside from the <i>Tractatus Opticus I<i> edited by Mersenne.||Emmanuel Maignan and Isaac Barrow were aware of Hobbes' theory of light, including it pulsed-motion mediumistic basis and the theory of rays and their role in refraction. Though both adopted the theory of physical light rays, they rejected the mediumistic theory and held to one involving emission. Maignan used Hobbes' 'ray line' explicitly in his explanation of reflection in the <i>Perspectiva Horaria<i> of 1648.||The <i>Opera Philosophica<i> appeared at Amsterdam in 1668 and edited by William Molesworth at London in 1839-1845.
","Material on optics and vision appears in several places in the <i>Opera Philosophica<i>. In the first part, the work De Corpore contains Chapters 19, 24, and 27. Chapter 19 gives explanation and consequences of the equal angle law of reflection considering plane and spherical mirrors in the form of elementary ray analysis. Chapter 24 one the law of reflection and the sine law of refraction. Chapter 27 is on the nature, causes, and propagation of light, the nature of color as 'perturbed light', the cause of prismatic colors, the nature of white and black.||in the second part of the <i>Opera Omina<i>, the work De Homine contains 50 pages on vision, catoptrics and dioptrics, most of it an analysis of images produced by mirrors and lenses using geometrical optics, all in the context of human vision. It includes an analysis of vision through microscopes and telescopes. De Homine  contains 15 chapters, with chapters 2-9 devoted to optics and vision. Chapter 2: ocular anatomy, visual function, Keplerian theory of retinal images. Chapter 3: Visual perception of location and size of objects, visual errors, the moon illusion, illumination from the stars and the moon. Chapter 4: Simple linear perspective. Chapter 5: Images and apparent location of objects seen in plane and convex spherical mirrors. Chapter 6: Images and apparent location of objects seen in concave spherical mirrors. Chapter 7: Objects seen by a single refraction. Chapter 8: Objects seen by two refractions, dioptrics, convex and concave surfaces. Chapter 9: Dioptrics of the telescope and microscope.||At the time of his works of the 1640s, Hobbes' theory of light was a pulsed motion in a medium produced by a source. Rays of light were the paths of this motion and were considered as physical objects with extension. The analysis of reflection and refraction was conducted using the front of the ray, a 'ray line' perpendicular to the ray's direction of travel, and its interaction with mirror or refractive surfaces. This was the first kinematic explanation for the the laws of reflection and refraction. Vision was caused by this pulsed motion being received by the retina and transmitted to the brain--a rejection of Keplerian retinal images. The material in De Homine is an application of Hobbes' general theory of optics to human vision. In De Corpore, which touched on light's interaction with objects, Hobbes' had modified his pulsed motion in the aetherial medium to a circular motion. The work De Corpore considers light's interaction with objects by reflection and refraction.

Andr√© Tacquet,"Tacquet, Andr√©",,1612-1660,"Edited by Simone Lorenzo Veterani ",Opera Mathematica,"Posthumous editing and publication of a set of teaching manuals for the Jesuit schools. One, of 70 pages, is devoted to optics and, being practical rather than theoretical, uses geometrical-optics and experiments to present propositions on optics, perspective, projections for astrolabes, and the catoptrics of plane and curved mirrors. ","Andr√© Tacquet taught at the Flemish Jesuit school in Louvain from 1644 until his death in 1660. His <i>Elementa Euclidea Geometriae Planae et Solidae<i> of 1654 and <i>Arithmeticae Teor√≠a et Praxis<i> of 1656 were famous and tremendously successful textbooks; the <i>Elementa<i> saw more than 30 editions and was translated into English. This demonstrated success as a textbook writer had the Jesuit General Goswin Nickel request Tacquet to write a broader <i>cursus mathematicus<i> suitable for use in Jesuit schools. This meant an elementary exposition of Mixed Mathematics, used by a large number of beginning students, supporting the courses taught at Louvain and other Jesuit schools. Tacquet's response was to write an extensive series of teaching manuals covering arithmetic, geometry, statics, optics, astronomy and cosmography, ballistics, and military architecture. Of these only those on arithmetic and geometry were published in his lifetime; the others were unfinished. Some of these were, in turn, edited and assembled by Simon Laurent and published as the <i>Opera Mathematica<i>. He included Astronomy, Practical Geometry, Optics, and Catoptrics. Though Tacquet's text refers to a work on dioptrics, it was never found.||In keeping with his charge--and his own interests--Tacquet's approach to all aspects of Mixed Mathematics was practical and rarely ventured into theory. The geometric treatise on cyclinders and rings rejects Cavalieri's indivisibles--points make lines, lines make planes, planes make solids--for something more Archimedean: a method of exhaustion. Which led, via Blaise Pascal, to the development of infinitesimals. The treatise on astronomy--the largest by far, and probably the most complete at the time of Tacquet's death--presents but does not embrace Kepler's planetary elliptical orbits since he thought them as being of little practical  importance. For the same failure of practicality, he does not present arguments either for or against Copernican cosmography since he finds them merely statements of what is or is not probable.  Practicality is also the byword for the optics material.||An aspect of Tacquet‚Äôs pedagogical style is his unwillingness to present 'explanations' that he considers to be mere suppositions and not demonstrations. Another is his presentation of competing explanations but failure to discriminate between them or plump for one. These are seen in the treatise on astronomy and on optics.||A long summary and review of the <i>Opera Mathematica<i> appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Vol 3, No 43, January 1668. Editions appeared at Antwerp in 1668, 1699, and 1707.
","Tacquet's <i>Opera Mathematica<i> contains a treatise on astronomy in 8 books, a summary of practical geometry in 3 books, a treatise on optics in 3 books, a treatise on catoptrics in 3 books, and brief treatise on military architecture.  The first book of optics covers the appearance of things; that is, the nature of visual perception. Tacquet presents hypotheses that are actually what he considers to be statement of fact, followed by propositions that are presented as direct consequences. The result is an eclectic hybrid: light travels in straight lines, but objects 'project images that are captured by the eye' and produce perception. Position, size, and shape are governed by simple geometric optics and an appeal to the authority of Euclid, Alhazen, and Witelo. The appearance of circles, cones, and spheres (including the phases of the moon) from various view are described in this way. The second book of optics is on simple linear perspective, projection scenography, and anamorphosis. The third book of optics is on 'projective astronomy.' This covers dialling and the construction of astrolabes.||The first book of catoptrics covers basic reflection, presents the equal-angle law of reflection, its Cartesian and Witelian explanations, and its application to various mirrors. Tacquet believed the law of reflection could be also considered a consequence of a more general law: 'nature always acts along the shortest path.' The second book of catoptrics considers plane mirrors and their images. The third book of catoptrics considers curved mirrors and their images. This includes spherical parabolic, elliptical, and hyperbolic mirrors. Though its generality had been disproved by Kepler, Tacquet kept the 'Ancient Principle' of the cathetus for locating reflected images; a principle he considered 'the most fruitful in all of catoptrics', even though by his own experimentation he found cases involving spherical mirrors where it did not properly locate images.||Some of the Propositions involve experiments that range from simple, common visual observations to more elaborate investigations, particularly in optics. Physical optics is only touched upon, but the geometric optics is detailed, analytic, and accompanied by elaborate figures.","Jesuit Science in the Spanish Netherlands|Vanpaemel, G. H.

"Benedetto Castelli, OSM","Castelli, Benedetto OSM",born Antonio Castelli,1578-1643," ","Opuscoli Filosofici ","A collection of brief discourses. The most famous, in the form of a letter to Giovanni Ciampoli, is the Discorso sulla Vista and deals with vision and its preservation, perceptions and illusions, and causes of poor eyesight. Another discourse is a letter to Galileo and deals with surface colors and radiant heat, and luminous effect decreasing with the square of the distance from the source.
","Benedetto Castelli was the oldest, closest, and most faithful of Galileo's pupils. Though Galileo himself and most of his pupils had little interest in matters related to biology, one of the exceptions was Castelli, who had begun work on vision in about 1630. In 1639 he summarized his work in the <i>Discorso sulla Vista<i> in the form of a long letter to Giovanni Ciampoli, another friend of Galileo and camerlengo to Pope Urban VIII. Manuscript copies of the <i>Discorso<i> circulated in Galileo's circle and members of the Accademia del Cimento in Florence and so was not widely known, even in Italy, until its posthumous appearance with Castelli's  other work on light and heat in the <i>Alcuni Opuscoli Filosofici del Padre D. Benedetto Castelli<i> of 1669. The decision to publish the <i>Discorso<i> was, apparently, prompted by the appearance of Edm√© Mariotte's <i>Nouvelles Decouvertes Touchant la V»óe<i> in 1668 and the subsequent interest of Cardinal Leopoldo de'Medici. And so, members of the Accademia del Cimento gathered Castelli's Discorsi together and had them printed in Bologna.||The <i>Discorso sulla Vista<i> presents the clear recognition of the retina's fundamental role, mentions early cataract surgery and the optical diaphragm, recognizes and describes the persistence of visual images, and--most advanced of Catelli's ideas--a clearly stated phenomenology of vision. Castelli also presents experiments on the Moon Illusion, and his explanatory theory which anticipates 20th century perceptual research. The other discourse presents among the earliest experiments on heat absorption by colored bodies and a theory to explain the results.||Editions appeared at Bologna in 1669 and reprinted at Florence in 1874.
","The <i>Discorso sulla Vista<i> begins with advice, based on experiments, on improving presbyopia: view through a small aperture. He then describes a series of experiments with a camera obscura and a lens, to show that small apertures exclude rays and produce a sharper image. From followed a careful consideration of the parallels between the camera obscura and the optical operation of the eye. This is followed by 24 questions regarding phenomena of vision. In modern terms the questions consider the following. Questions 1-3 deal with correction of near and far-sightedness, 4 considers clouded vitreous humor, 5-6 deal with spherical aberration and correction by diaphragms, 7-10 deal with image persistence and the 'slowness' of the retina, 11 presents Castelli's theory of vision based on the kinetic impact of light particles on the retina. Castelli contends that most visual phenomena can be explained by a consideration of what happens to the retina in the visual process.  Questions 12-13 consider irradiance and the increase in apparent size of luminous objects, and 14-22 apply his theory of retinal function to an explanation of various vision abnormalities, impairments, animal vision, and changing sensitivities.||Questions 23-24 consider the Moon Illusions and the problem of distance and size perception in general. Castelli is most ingenious and original on these matters. He formulates a theory that involves not just image size on the retina, but the context of the image, the history and judgement of the observer. He applies all this to explanations for the Moon Illusion and the similar apparent size increase of the Big Dipper asterism when it is near the horizon.||In the letter to Galileo, Castelli recounts his experiments with heat and light. He conducts several experiments showing the differential heating produced by white and black surfaces, hypothesizes that heat is the manifestation of the motion of particles. These demonstrations and those described in the Discorso sulla Vista reveal the thoroughgoing experimental nature of  Castelli's work.","‚ÅÇùëª A Little Known Early Seventeenth Century Treatise on Vision: Benedetto Castelli's Discorso Sopra La Vista (1639, 1669)|Arrioti, P.E.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 30, No 1, 1973, pp 1-30.||Mattoni al sole: Benedetto Castelli, la luce e il calore|Campogalliani, P.|<i>Atti dell'Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere e Arti<i>, Vol 152, 1993-1994, pp 15-31.||Benedetto Castelli and George Berkeley as Anticipators of Recent Findings on the Moon Illusion|Arrioti, P.E.|<i>Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences<i>, Vol 9, No 4, 1973, pp 328-332.","Alcuni Opuscoli Filosofici del padre abbate D.

Honor√© Fabri,"Fabri, Honor√©",,1608-1688," ",Physica,"Volume 1 of Honor√© Fabri's monumental 4-volume, 8-tract work on physics; that is, the 'knowledge of corporeal things'. A comprehensive work covering all aspects of bodies, from motion, mechanical properties, luminous properties, on to the corporeality of man, and finally anthropology. Essentially Aristotelian, but with significant accommodation of the ideas of Galileo, Gassendi, and others.
","Volume 1 of Honor√© Fabri's monumental 4-volume, 8-tract work on physics; that is, the 'knowledge of corporeal things'. Honor√© Fabri began work on the <i>Physica<i> after he had been stationed in Rome for 20 years. With the appearance of his <i>Tractatus Duo<i> in 1666 and its success, Fabri had revived his writing and publishing efforts that had stopped when he was sent to Rome in 1648||Originally intended to consist of 5 volumes containing 10 tracts, only four volumes containing 8 tracts were published, appearing at Lyon between 1669 and 1671. Fabri sets out the plan for the <i>Physica<i> in his letter to the reader, showing that it was conceived and executed as a comprehensive work covering all aspects of physics, with tracts 1-4 devoted to sensible bodies and their states, tract 5 on natural bodies and the four elements, tracts 6-7 on mixed and unmixed matter, tract 8 on celestial bodies, and tracts 9-10 on plants, animals, and man. The material ranging from elementary properties, motion, mechanical properties, luminous properties, on to the corporeality of man, and finally anthropology. Volume 1 contains Tractatus I and II. Book 3 of Tract 1 deals with opacity and transparency and Book 3 of Tract 2 deals with light sources and their light (Luce et Lumine) and color.||Fabri's plan was a complete reformation of physics. Though a committed Aristotelian, he was keen on returning to Aristotle's original ideas, clearing away what others considered commentaries, but what he considered to be Scholastic and Arabic accretions. He believed that physics could be based on the four elements of matter, what he called impetus, heat, and a few ideas from metaphysics: action, extension, time, and place. From these he believed universal physical hypotheses could be obtained, accounting for all observed physical phenomena. All informed by the certainty of geometry. And so, the fundamental ideas of Aristotle could accommodate the new science of Galileo, Gassendi, Grimaldi, Borelli, and Gilbert. And so, for example, light is described as an accident of a substance and color as a modification of light, though luminous rays and geometrical optics are used to describe the elementary aspects of emanation, reflection, and refraction.
","Volume 1 of Honor√© Fabri's <i>Physica<i> contains two tracts. Tractatus I is in five books: On Quantity of Bodies, On Compression and Tension, On Rarity and Density, On Heaviness and Lightness, On Opacity and Translucency. Tractatus II is in five books: On Cold, On Heat, On Luminance and Light, On Wetness, Dryness, Hardness, Softness, etc.||Book 5 of Tract 1 (14 pages) deals with opacity and transparency vis-√†-vis luminous rays. Two Definitions, two axioms on Aristotelian Form, two hypotheses on the angles of reflection and refraction, and 64 brief Propositions are devoted to the nature of opacity and transparency, materials exhibiting either, and a range of examples. Transparency is presented as the property of an object to conduct luminous rays, such as air, glass, and water. Logically, but strangely, vacuum is declared to be opaque, since there would be nothing present to conduct luminous rays. Book 3 of Tract 2, longer and more detailed (70 pages), has 109 propositions on light sources and their light (Lux et Lumine) and color. Of all his optical works, this is Fabri's most extensive consideration of the nature of light. He rejects both the theory of emanation of corpuscles of Democretus and Empedocles and that of it being motion in a tenuous medium; he adheres to the Aristotelian: Lux is inherent luminous power and lumen is its effect transmitted through transparent bodies. Potential transparency is actualized by lux, with color being a modification of of light. Light and heat are presented as the same 'quality' of an object, light being 'pure heat'. The elementary aspects of vision are presented and luminous rays are used to describe the elementary aspects of emanation, reflection, and refraction.||The material is entirely descriptive, no mathematics is involved. Fabri uses 'Hypothesis' to indicate a fact of nature, something that can be observed with certainty or demonstrated simply. Thus, for example, equal angles of specular reflection is an hypothesis.","Deux essais de renouvellement de la Scolastique au XVIIe si√®cle.

"Jean  Leurechon, ","Leurechon, Jean SJ ",Hendrik van Etten,1591-1670," ",R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques,"An expansion of previous editions, in three parts; the first a reprinting of the problems of the edition of 1626, the second part a reprinting of problems of the second part of the edition of 1629. New optical problems include rudimentary optical devices for surveying, the use of mirrors in viewing instruments, and lanterns with reflectors.","One of the many editions of the text that appeared in the last half of 17th century. 'Problems' are presented, some of several parts, with solutions constituting a collection of experiments, apparatus demonstrations, recipes, and parlor tricks in cosmology, optics, perspective, mechanics, statics, practical geometry, fortification and gunnery. Designed to entertain and instruct. The source for the arithmetical problems was Claude Bachet's <i>Problems Plaisans et Delectables<i> of 1612. The problems in geometry are in the Renaissance tradition of 'practical geometry'; geometry applied to surveying, mensuration, and fortification. Many of the other problems come from the tradition of secretes and natural magic, such as Girolamo Ruscelli's <i>De' Secretis del Alessio Piemontese<i> in the edition of 1615. Some of the problems in natural philosophy appear to be from works by Giambattista Della Porta, Girolamo Cardano, and Salomon de Caus. Renaissance books on conjuring and prestidigitation were a source for the <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i>.||Tradition has assigned authorship to the Jesuit Jean Leurechon, though there is little scholarly evidence for this. Whoever assembled this collection of problems and secrets produced a book that was tremendously popular, being in print in various forms for more than 150 years. Thirty editions in French appeared between 1624 and 1680. Denis Henrion and Claude Mydorge were contributors and commentators for editions between 1626 and 1639, adding significant value to the book. Jacques Ozanam began editing editions in 1694, adding material and changing the content to be more like an encyclopedia. Jean-Etienne Montucla and Edm√© Gilles Guyot were subsequent editors and by 1769 there were four volumes. Translations appeared in English, Latin, Dutch, and German. This edition uses the same woodcut illustrations from the text of 1627.
","This and other editions of <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i> have a preface to the reader from the author which names some of his sources and the general nature of what he tried to accomplish. This is followed by Part I containing 91 'Problems' on various subjects, including: Arithmetic, Geometry, Optics and Perspective, Music, Cosmographical Matters. The camera obscura, burning mirrors and lenses, plane and curved mirrors, clear and colored looking-glasses, and the rainbow are presented in a rudimentary way. In this and other early editions, the optical material is limited to display and demonstration, with little or no explanation of the phenomena itself. Part II contains 45 Problems on similar subjects, these first appeared in the edition of 128. Part III is the briefest, containing 17 problems in fireworks and artillery. There are a few problems in Part II devoted to optics and projection that have a very different character than the original problems of Part I--more detailed and  explanatory, rather than simply reporting. The problems in Part I and their examinations, and the problems in Part II, never involve mathematics above the simplest geometry, thus maintaining their popular science character.","‚ÅÇ R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques (1624) A Study on its Authorship, Sources and Influence|Heefer, A.|<i>Gibeci√®re<i>, Vol. 1, No 2, 2006, pp. 79-167.","Recreations mathematiques composees de plusieures problemes plaisants et facetieux d'Arithmetique, Geometrie, Astrologie, Optique, Perspective, Mechanqiue, & autres rares & curius Secrets: Et d'un Recueil de plusieurs gentilles & recratives inventions de feux d'artifice; avec la maniere de faire toutes fortes de fusees simples, & composees.

Molinetti applied his anatomical knowledge of the eye represented here in detail as an engraved diagram and  to the construction of the most detailed model of the ocular cavity to date, working with the Venetian instrument maker Giovanni Battista Verle to produce an elaborate model of the eye.

Erasmus Bartholin,"Bartholin, Erasmus",,1838-1917," ",Experimenta Crystalli Islandici Disdiaclastici,"Describes the discovery of double refraction while experimenting with crystals from Iceland.
","In 1668, Frederic III of Denmark ordered the keepers of curiosity cabinet to arrange a two-man expedition of a stone-cutter and assistant to Iceland in 1668 to mine crystals of Icelandic Spar--calcite, or crystallized calcium carbonate. Bartholin began experimenting with samples and saw that, when properly cleaved and placed on a surface with a small image, the crystal produced two images, one in the usual place and another displaced. Eventually, he realized that the two images we being formed by two paths of refraction; he had found 'dioptrical refraction.' Though Bartholin noted the change in brightness of these images, depending on their position, the reason for this and the existence of two images he did not attempt to explain. The two rays he called 'solita' and 'insolita'--ordinary and extraordinary--and showed that both were produced by refraction.||Samples of the crystal were eventually obtained by Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens, and Isaac Newton. Bartholin worked until 1674 to share his experimental results but the return was slow in coming. Eventually, Huygens would study the phenomena and propose an explanation for double refraction in his <i>Trait√© de la Lumi√®re<i> of 1690. Newton's Opticks of 1704 did not deal with double refraction. But in Query 17 of the Latin Optice of 1706, which became Query 25 of later English editions, Newton stated a ‚Äòrule‚Äô purporting to give the direction of the extraordinary ray in terms of that of the ordinary ray. This was later shown to be incorrect by the French mineralogist Ren√© Just Ha√ºy in an experiment published in 1788. Icelandic Spar become a common item in collections and cabinets of curiosities, but though described often and at length, it was not until Jean Etienne Malus experimental work trying to establish a corpuscular theory of double refraction, that Huygens ideas were proved correct. It was Malus who detected that the two rays were differently polarized. The discovery of double refraction by Bartholin was the beginning of important developments in physical optics.||Editions appeared in 1669 and as a reissue with a redated title page in 1670. The work was translated in German, French, Dutch, and English.","Bartholin begins with a dedication to Frederick III of Denmark followed by two parts of the work. The first begins with a general remarks about the nature of the crystal, followed by a description of 17 experiments. The second part is subtitled 'Observations to prove the preceding remarks.' These are a series of hypotheses regarding the behavior of the crystal followed by propositions purporting to show how well the hypotheses align with his experimental results. One of these hypotheses was based on Descartes' theory that light moved along 'pores' in transparent material, coupled with his own idea that there were two sets of 'pores' in the crystal.||Experiments I - IV involve the rhombic shape and other physical, chemical, and 'electrical' properties of the crystal. Experiments V and VI describe the discovery and nature of double images. Experiments VII and VIII give some crystallographic details including face orientations and edge angles. Experiments IX - X investigate the orientation, placement, and motion of the double images. Experiments XI determines the nature of the double images. Experiments XII - XVI properties of the images, whether from reflection of refraction, how they rotated, and their varying brightness. Experiment XVII reports measurements of the two refractive indices of the crystal.||The figures are generally clear and essential to an understanding of Bartholin's description of his experiments and their results. This include crystal shape, orientation, and optical paths. One of the images is an edge-net that, when cut out, can be folded into a three-dimensional model of the crystal. Bartholin's title used a neologism of his own, the the Greco-Latin 'disdiaclasticus' (Œ¥ŒπœÉŒ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒªŒ±œÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ), from which came 'birefringent.'","‚ÅÇ Nova Experimenta Crystalli Islandici Disdiaclastici|Lohne, J.A.|Centaurus, Vol 21, No 2, 1977, pp 106-148.||Kinematic Optics: A Study of the Wave Theory of Light in the Seventeenth Century|Shapiro, D.|<i>Archive for History of Exact Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 2, 1973, pp 134-266.","Experimenta Crystalli Islandici disdiaclastici, quibus mira et insolita refractio detegitur","Experiments with the Double Refracting Iceland Crystal, by which a Remarkable and Extraordinary Refraction was Revealed.",,1670,1650-1675,"Danish physician, mathematician, and physicist.

"Francesco Lana de Terzi, SJ","Lana de Terzi, Francesco SJ",,1631-1687," ","Prodromo ","Lana's book presents and analyzes a wide range of technical developments. Famed for its discussion of flight and its figure of a ship afloat with copper balloons, it contains much else. One third of the book is devoted to the design, construction and use of telescopes and microscopes.
","Francesco Lana de Terzi was at the Collegium Romanum under Athanasius Kircher where learned natural philosophy and witnessed first-hand the power and utility of experiment, the popularity of books on natural philosophy, and the pedagogical importance of cabinets of instruments. When he returned to his native Northwestern Italy, he began to experiment and write. Unlike those of his fellow Jesuit and contemporary Gaspar Schott, who also was a student of Kircher, Lana de Terzi's work are not deeply tinctured with the ideas of natural magic and Llullism. Rather, Lana de Terzi is interested in mechanics and physics, mathematical analysis, and experiment. All this to the end of obtaining practical knowledge and use instruments and devices.||From the long Proemio, it is clear that Lana de Terzi was eclectic about Aristotelianism and developed a hybrid that often blended it, and on occasion replaced it, with new science. He states that Niccol√≤ Cabeo and Pierre Gassendi are the best modern writers in physics. An enthusiastic experimenter, he also cites impediments to advancing science: attachment to antiquity and pet subjects such as logic and theology.||The <i>Prodromo<i> (from the Greek, œÄœÅœåŒ¥œÅoŒºo, precursor) was written in Italian and clearly intended for students and a limited public audience. Nevertheless, it aims considerably above works  of popular science of the time. Topics in the <i>Prodromo<i> include flying ships and early theory of the aerostatics, research in communication including reading and writing systems for the blind, clocks of various kinds, odometers, hygrometers, and considerable material on optics. One third of the text is devoted to lenses, telescopes, and microscopes.||Though the <i>Prodromo<i> was never reviewed in any prominent journal, it was widely read. Robert Hooke would later comment on the book's proposal of an aerial ship. Via John Dodington, English diplomatic agent in Venice, Lana de Terzi sent a copy to the Royal Society of London. Presumably, Hooke read this copy in preparation for his talk to the Society in 1672 on Lana de Terzi's 'aerial globe' and for which he constructed a model. A discussion of the 'aerial globe' appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1679.  Gottfried Leibniz reviewed the principles involved in his <i>Hypothesis Physica Nova<i> of 1671. The <i>Prodromo<i> was edited and reprinted at Milano in 1977.
","The <i>Prodromo<i> is in three parts. The first part, Prodromo all' Arte Maestra, contains 24 chaptes on instruments and devices. The second part, L' Arte della Pittura, contains 4 chapters on painting, paints, color, drawing and drawing instruments. The third part, Molti sorti di Cannocchiali e Microscopi (83 pages and 50 figures), contains 8 chapters on lens optics and applications to instruments.||The first part, Chapter 6, presents Lana di Terzi's famed description of a ship floated by evacuated copper balloons, and a theory of aeronautics based on concepts of air density, weight, and the principle of Torriceli. Several instruments are discussed, including the thermometer, hygrometer, odometer, and the pendulum clock. It also contains his system of reading and writing for the blind. The third part of the book is devoted to the design and making of lenses and the construction and use of telescopes and microscopes. Galilean, Keplerian, and multiple-lensed telescopes are discussed. Lens working, grinding, and testing are described, with the desire being elliptical, hyperbolic, or parabolic figures. The source of lens imperfections and how they can be remedied is presented, and concludes by describing the uses of telescopes and microscopes. It ends, whimsically, by describing how to use the telescope 'to deceive friends with a delightful show', that is to obtain effects of trompe-l‚Äôoeil.","Seventeenth-century inventions and drawings in the Francesco Lana's works|Chirone, E. and Dassa, L.|In: <i>Conference Proceedings XXI Congreso Internacional INGEGRAF, at Lugo<i>, 2009.||<i>Francesco Lana Terzi e la scienza barocca<i>|Pighetti, C.|Commentari dell' Ateneo di Brescia, 1985, pp 97-117|http://www.ateneo.brescia.it/controlpanel/uploads/commentari-1908-2008/CAB1985.pdf||Pious Ambition: Natural Philosoophy and the Jesuit Quest for the Patrongage of Printed Book in the Seventeenth Century|Baldwin, M.|In: <i>Jesuit Science and the Rebulic of Letters<i>|Feingold, M., editor|MIT Press, Cambridge, 2003, 489 pp, NB: pp 283-329.","Prodromo Overo saggio de alcune inventioni nuove premesso all' arte maestra.

Two books deal with light, color, and vision in Aristotelian terms, seven books deal with horology, and one book deals with the metaphysics of light and light-related phenomena including optical illusions, mirrors, lenses, and the camera obscura. In this edition, this last book included a description of the magic lantern along with a new but incorrect figure.
","Athanasius Kircher was visited in Rome by Marin Mersenne in 1644 as Kircher, who by then was known throughout Europe, was finishing the <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i>. It and other topics engaged both scholars, particularly as this was Kercher's first book on natural philosophy. Since 1630 he had produced seven books, each becoming evermore elaborate, encyclopedic, and costly. <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i> appeared in 1646 and was the most elaborate thus far. it contained nearly 1000 pages of facts, imaginings, devices, and topics--however distantly related--regarding light and shadow, augmented with 36 plates of figures, 41 pages of tables, and about 480 in-text drawings. Dazzled, perhaps by the book's elaborateness, it had been approved by two Jesuit censors, both literary men, neither with the understanding necessary to review the contents. And so, the book went to press unfiltered by anyone with a knowledge of optics. But even by mid 18th century standards, 'optics' would not have been considered the principal topic of Kircher's book. As the title makes clear, it is about Light and Shadow, not optics; Perspectiva, Alhazen, Witelo, and Euclid are given only glancing mention. At the end of his preface to the reader, Kircher states he did not want to write a theoretical work and apologizes to his mathematical colleagues for neglecting the material's rigor, especially geometric optics. Kircher is more interested in phenomena and applications.||The disparate, elaborate, compilational nature of <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i> is an expression of a view of knowledge and the world. Kircher believed all human knowledge was linked, is derived from divine wisdom, could be manifested by natural or artificial magic (what today would be called technology), and, following the medieval philosopher Ramon Llull, could be comprehended if the correct organizing framework could be found. The book is not so much structured by its content as it is bound together by--and freighted with--symbolism, Christian Kabbalah, metaphysics, and references to and use of ancient languages. The last is an aspect of Kircher's belief in a single ancient language, his deep interest in philology, and responsible for the strange, Greek-based neologisms in many of the book's section titles.||The elaborate nature of the book made it expensive and limited its audience. Its reception by European scholars was generally negative, expecting as they were a book on optics. It did not help that the book contained what purported to be a geometric method for squaring the circle; natural philosophers and mathematicians across Europe hooted their derision. However strange and unfiltered its content, the book presents the baroque culture of esotericism, natural magic, and the desire to overlay the natural world with an elaborate interconnected structure that spanned history, culture, and geography. Kircher's influence in this regard would be most apparent in his student Gaspar Schott's <i>Magia Universalis Natur√¶ et Artis<i> of 1657. Editions of <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i> appeared in 1646 and 1671.
","<i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶<i> contains ten books on subjects related--however tenuously--to Light and Shadow and a final section on optical cryptography and metaphysical epilogue. The meaning of section or book titles are given, rather than direct or literal translation of section titles, since most consist of words Kircher invented.  Book 1: The Nature of Light and Shadow.  Book 2: On Radiation Propagation. Book 3: Curious Gnomics. Book 4: Various Gnomic Horologies. Book 5: Anamorphosis Gnomics. Book 6: Gnomic Shapes for Astrolabes. Book 7: Gnomics by Reflection. Book 8: Gnomics by Refraction. Book 9: Cosmographical Gnomics. Book 10: The Natural Magic of Light and Shadow. Book 1 has three parts. It begins with light sources, including the sun, moon, stars, fire, animal and vegetable light, and light from minerals. This is followed by a 'Scholastic Disquisition' on the nature and effects of light, much of which was lifted from Fortunio Liceti's <i>De Luminis Natura<i> of 1640. The second part of Book 1 considers shadow and its applications including the production of shadow, degrees of shadow, and gnomic shadows. Shadow for Kircher is not the lack of light, but an entity per se. The third part of Book 1 considers colors. This includes various color source and phenomena including atmospheric, sea, refractive, mineral, and animal color. It is here that Kircher presents his color diagram, derived from Francois d' Aguil√≥n's <i>Opticorum Libri Sex<i> of 1613 and adhering to the Scholastic teaching that color arises from a blending of white and black. Book 2 has two parts. It begins with a general consideration of the propagation of 'radiations' from objects; the prototype is light as propagated visible species rendering objects visible when their species are received by the eye. This notion is applied to sound and odor as well. The second part of Book 2 deals with the eye and vision. Though modern ocular anatomy is briefly described, no details are given; most of the material is devoted to projections and scenography. Book 10 is a survey of applications, phenomena, and devices and has three parts. The first part shows the use of reflection and refraction in sundials of various forms. The second part considers projections of various forms and refraction. The camera obscura is described but not explained and it is here that lenses are discussed and Kepler's <i>Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena<i> of 1604 is quoted, leading to a discussion of the telescope. In this edition a section on the magic lantern was added to this second part, though the description is somewhat confused. The third part is a general consideration of catoptrics. This includes the nature and properties of plane, spherical, parabolic, and hyperbolic mirrors. Burning mirrors and applications for 'optical wonders' using plane, multiple, and segmented mirrors are presented.||The material in Books 1, 2, and 10 is entirely descriptive; phenomena or apparatus are simply presented, there is rarely any explanation of cause or operation. Mathematics is very rarely used, and then never more than elementary geometry.","L' 'Ars Magan Lucis et Umbrae' di Athanasius Kircher|Corradion, S.

"Michel Lass√®re, OFM-CAP","Lass√®re, Michel OFM-CAP",Ch√©rubin d'Orl√©ans,1613-1697," ",La Dioptrique Oculaire,"The most exhaustive treatise on lens making in the 17th century. Comprehensive regarding the telescope, it includes microscopes, opera glasses, optical pantographs, and binocular instruments, all delt with from first-hand experience.
","The origins of Ch√©rubin d‚ÄôOrl√©ans‚Äôs <i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> are clear from his letter to the reader.  He was captivated by Galileo's <i>Sidereus Nuncius<i>, was inspired by the possibilities of optical instruments, and came to desire the approbation of the learned. He knew his own mathematical abilities and sought to study dioptrics. Later, he began his optical work, wanting to reduce theory of dioptrics to practice. That is, he would design and make optical instruments admired by natural philosophers. This desire is clear from the subtitle of the work: The Theory, The Practice, and The Mechanics of Oculars. Theory is used to envision instruments, their properties, and their function. Practice is used to design and make the dioptric parts of instruments. And Mechanics guides their actual construction.||Ch√©rubin worked on the dioptrics manuscript from 1665 to 1668 and which, presumably, Capuchin modesty kept him from publishing. But it was read by the bishop of Tulles, Louis de Rechignevoisin de Guron, who circulated it and received positive responses. Ch√©rubin was then sent to Paris to meet Guron's friends and have the work published. There, Ch√©rubin met Colbert, to whom he dedicated the work. The frontispiece half-title was drawn by Jean le Pautre and engraved by Gerard Edelinck.||In the 'Order and Plan of the Author', Ch√©rubin makes clear that his theory and principles come from his own experiments and those of Kepler, whom he 'found more to conform with his own findings'. Ch√©rubin follows Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> of 1611 very closely and draws from it extensively. Additionally, only his own experimentation and practice is reported; nothing is presented that he himself has not performed, examined, constructed, or practiced. This grounding in practice is an aspect of <i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> that made it so important to optical instrumentation in the late 17th century. Another important aspect was Ch√©rubin's insistence on the coupling of vision and optics; the best instruments would not result from considerations of light and lenses that excluded vison, and central to this was Ch√©rubin's commitment to idea of the superiority of binocular vision. Several binocular instruments are described.||Though microscopes are considered, <i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> is essentially a complete manual on telescope making. It is remarkable for its coverage: principles of telescope operation; lens design; principles for lenses spacing; lens grinding, figuring, and polishing; equipment necessary for lens working; proper lens apertures for best viewing; mechanical details of tubes, mountings, aiming, and instrument use; and a cataloguing of observations made with his instruments including selenography, sun spots, planetary observations, and comets. Ch√©rubin's manual was the most detailed, exhaustive treatment of lens making in the 17th century and was referenced and cited for more than 50 years. One of his lens lathes was taken up and perfected by the great Italian lens maker Giuseppe Campani. Ch√©rubin is cited in Robert Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738.
","<i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> is in three parts. Part 1, on the eye and vision, is in 5 sections, 52 pages. Section 1: The eye and vision in general. Sections 2 and 3: Direct Vision. Sections 4 and 5: Refracted Vision. Part 2, on refraction and the telescope, is in 12 sections, 110 pages. Sections 1 and 2: Refraction at spherical surfaces. Section 3: Convex lenses for telescopes of the first type. Section 4: Concave lenses and telescopes of the first type. Section 5: Convex and concave lenses and telescopes of the first type. Section 6: Convex lenses and telescopes of the second type. Section 7: Multiple lenses for telescopes of the second type. Section 8: Magnification of small objects. Section  9: Microscopes. Section 10: Catadioptric telescopes using reflection and refraction. Section 11: Binocular telescopes. Section 12: Lens design and specification. Part 3-Practice, on the construction and use of telescopes and microscopes, is in 12 Sections, 173 pages. Part 3-Mechanics, on lens making, equipment, and mechanics, is in 6 sections, 75 pages. Section 1: Lens forming, grinding, and polishing by hand. Section 2: Lens forming, grinding, and polishing with a 'guided' hand. Section 3: Lens forming, grinding, and polishing by simple machines. Section 4: Lenses by machines guided by hand. Section 5: Making accurate concave lenses. Section 6: A universal method for spherical surfaces.||Part 1 presents the optical properties of the main parts of the eye and their function, following Kepler. This is supplemented with material from Christopher Scheiner‚Äôs <i>Oculus<i> of 1619 and <i>Rosa Ursina<i> of 1632.||Part 2 presents the theory of telescopes. Lens analysis is based on Kepler's approximate law of refraction. Foci for convex, concave, biconvex, biconcave, and meniscus lenses are given, and Kepler's result for the interaction of two convex lenses is extended and used to consider Keplerian telescopes with up to 5 lenses. Ch√©rubin labels Galilean and Keplerian telescopes the first and second type, respectively. Part 2 also presents the analysis of multiple lens microscopes. In general, Part 2 builds on and extends the theory of lenses in Kepler's Dioptrice, with analysis limited to paraxial rays.||The first section of Part 3 presents the use of optical instruments and reports the observations Ch√©rubin made with them, including sun spot projection and lunar mapping.||The second section of Part 3 presents lens making. Cherubin gives (and used) three ways of making lenses: with a 'free and flowing hand' using only handcraft, with a 'constrained but flowing hand' using a mechanical tool, and with 'a machine that guides the hand.' such as with a lathe. The level of elaboration and detail in this Part is remarkable, covering every aspect of glass preparation, grinding, polishing materials and methods, mould use, and elaborate drawings and instructions for lathes and other tools.||The material clearly reflects Ch√©rubin's experience in lens making. He does not believe that a good lens can be made by machine alone--some handcraft is always required--and scoffs at the 'speculative mechanizers' struggling to make lenses of hyperbolic figure, citing the difficulty in just working with spherical surfaces.","<i>Descartes and the hyperbolic quest: Lens making machines and their significance in the seventeenth century<i>|Burnett, D.G.|American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 2005, pp 107‚Äì121.||Kepler's legacy: Telescopes and geometrical optics, 1611-1669|Malet, A.|In: <i>The Origins of the Telescope<i>, KNAW Press, Amsterdam, 2010, pp 281-300.||<i>Scientific Instruments of the 17th & 18th Centuries and their Makers<i>|Daumas, M.|Holbrook, M., translator|Portman, London, 1989.||<i>Prism and Lens Making<i>|Tyman, F.|Adam Hilger, London, 1942, pp. 1-10.||Lens Making for Scientific Instrumentation in the Seventeenth Century|Bedini, S.A.|<i>Applied Optics<i>, Vol 5, No 5, 1966, pp 687-694.||<i>The Quest for Perfect Vision: Ch√©rubin d‚ÄôOrl√©ans‚Äôs Optical Instruments and the Development of Theories of Binocular Perception in Late Seventeenth-Century France<i>|Gallay, A.|Mphil Dissertation, University of Cambridge, 2013, 34 p.","La Dioptrique Oculaire, ou La Theorique, La Positive, et La Mechanqiue, de L'Oculaire Dioptrique en toutes ses Especes.","The Dioptric Ocular, or the Theory, Practice, and Mechanics of the Dioptric Ocular in all its Forms.",French,1671,1650-1675,"French Capuchin, oculist, teacher.

Jacques Rohault,"Rohault, Jacques",,1618-1672," ",Trait√© de Physique,"Complete textbook of Cartesian-based natural philosophy. Fully empirical, with numerous experiments and observations reported to test theory and hypothesis. 115 pages are devoted to Cartesian optics and the theory of vision.
","Jacques Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> arose from his weekly 'Conferences' on natural philosophy that he began giving in 1659. Though an enthusiastic and committed Cartesian, Rohault was also a curious, skilled, and keen experimenter. The results were experiments, lectures, and notes that supported virtually every aspect of Cartesian physics with demonstrations and explanations. Copies of these notes circulated, being drafts of parts of what would become the <i>Trait√© de Physique<i>. Importantly and unlike other Cartesian textbooks of the era, Rohault's does not present any of Descartes' metaphysics and epistemology, nor was the book ever planned as part of wider course in Cartesian philosophy. Rather, it was written as a stand-alone text on Cartesian physics with extensive experimental underpinning, often making small of speculative philosophy and praising practice, experiment, and craft. In this regard, Rohault's experiments and demonstrations often overshadow, if not supplant, the metaphoric reasonings of Descartes. This is particularly the case in maters dealing with motion and with optics.||Rohault's reasons for writing his <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> are clear from his long preface. He sets out to overcome five impediments to physics' progress: ancient authority, metaphysics, extremes of experiment and reason, rejection of mathematics, and Scholastic distortion of Aristotle. His aim is not to write an encyclopedia but a carefully ordered textbook with experimentation at its core.||Rohault was the foremost Cartesian philosopher of this time. His pedagogical demonstrations, use of instruments, and numerous experiments informed his writing. This, and his reputation, had his text widely accepted and used, helping to cement Cartesian success for 50 years. It was used across Europe, being the physics textbook in use at the Universities of Utrecht, Frankfurt, Groningen, Louvain, Leyden, Cambridge, and Oxford, for example. It was described in the Journal des S√ßavans of June 22, 1671 as 'nothing other than a collection of reasoned experiments, methodically ordered' and soon became the foremost physics textbook in Europe. Twenty-five years later, Samuel Clarke's Latin translation of the <i>Trait√© de Physique<i>, accompanied by his notes, would become the Trojan Horse carrying Newtonian physics into the heart of Cartesianism. Extensively influential, there were editions of the French text in 1671, 1672, 1675, 1676, 1682, 1683, 1692, 1705, 1708, 1723, and 1730; translation into Latin appearing in 1674, 1682, 1697, 1700, 1702, 1708, 1710, 1713, 1718, and 1739; and into English appearing in 1723, 1728, 1735.
","Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> is in four parts. Part 1 is in 35 chapters and covers principles of physics, nature of matter, motion and its analysis, forms of matter, heat and cold, the senses of taste, smell, and hearing, and finally the eye, optics, and vision. The Cartesian principles of extension, divisibility, motion, and rest are used to deduce general laws of statics, dynamics, and--via ballistic conceptions  of reflection and refraction--optics. Part 2 is in 29 chapters and covers cosmography, astronomy, selenography, the planets and their movements, the fixed stars, and finally the competing theories of the sun and planets. Rohault plumps for the Copernican as the most rational. Part 3 is in 17 chapters and covers geology in general, including the Earth and things that are part of it, such as the atmosphere, the seas, metals and minerals, fountains, winds, fogs and clouds, rain and hail, snow and frosts, lighting, and finally the rainbow. Part 4 is in 26 chapters and covers anatomy, muscles and movement, blood and circulation, digestion and breathing, and finally maladies and disease.||The optics material covers 115 pages and though patterned closely after Descartes' essay <i>La Dioptrique<i>, it is fully empirical with experiments, demonstrations, and observations reported to test theory and hypothesis. The topics include: the nature of light, color, transparency and opacity. Direct, reflected, and refracted light are demonstrated as well as the simpler forms of image formation by mirrors and lenses. Descartes theory of vision is presented in full. All the optical topics are treated in an elementary but thorough manner. Thus, for example, the focusing properties of spherical convex lenses are demonstrated, but nothing is said of spherical aberration.||Experiment receives a double role: on the one hand, it is shown how it discriminates between conjectures pointing to the ones that are empirically confirmed; on the other hand, it is a powerful pedagogical tool that can convince the reader of explanations given and laws stated.","Rohault's Cartesian Physics|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Cartesian Empiricisms<i>, Springer, 2013, pp 203-226.||Rohault's Traite de Physique and its Newtonian Reception|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Proceedings of the 4th International Conference of the ESHS<i>, 2010, pp 389-394.||The experimental physics of Jacques Rohault|Spink A.|<i>British Journal for the History of Philosophy<i>, Vol 26, No 5, 2017, pp 850-870.||The Study of Early Scientific Textbooks|Sarton, G.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 38, No 3/4, 1948, pp 137-148.||Motion and God in XVIIth Century Cartesian manuals: Rohault, R√©gis and Gadroys|Milani, N.E.|<i>Noctua<i> Vol 2, Nos.1-2, 2015, pp 481-516.",Traite de physique,Treatise on Physics,French,1671,1650-1675,"French natural philosopher and mathematician.

Isaac Newton,"Newton, Isaac",,1642-1727," ",New Theory about Light and Colors,"Newton's letter describing his new theory of light and color, based on his interpretation of results from experiments he had begun in 1666, claiming that white light was a heterogeneous mixture of all colors.
","Newton's famed paper on his theory of light and colors reports results from experiments which he had begun in 1666 and pursued with some long interruptions until I671. A careful consideration of the shape of the well-known display of colors refracted from a prism led Newton to conclude that white light was heterogeneous, a compound of lights of different colors, with differing refragibility.||Johannes Marcus Marci de Cronland in his <i>Thaumantias<i> of 1648 had described prismatic colors and observed that once isolated, a color was not further dispersed by refraction and that 'diverse species of colors are the products of refraction.' But he attributed dispersion to varying angles of incidence and did not develop a general theory. For Newton, the separation into a spectrum was the result of inherently different properties of colored light and not an artifact of the prism, the light source, or any aspect of his experiment. The <i>experimentum crucis<i> that Newton described--and which proved difficult to duplicate carefully--was offered as proof of the inherent, differing but unchanging refractive property of colors.||Newton's idea ran counter to most previous conceptions of light. That the prism produced colors from white light was doubted by no one; that what it was doing was separating its inherently different colored components was doubted by virtually everyone. The appearance of Newton's letter provoked an intellectual thrust-and-parry that appeared in the Philosophical Transactions in multiple letters, the last which appeared in Vol XI, No 128, September 1676. Those involved were Robert Hooke, James Gregory, Robert Moray, Ignace-Gaston Pardies, Christiaan Huygens, Franciscus Linus, John Gascoines, and finally Anthony Lucas. From notes and letters, it is now known that Newton had begun to draft a large work on optics at this time, but the difficulties provoked by the publication of his theory of light and colors began a series of starts and stops, long delays, and abandonings that would last 30 years.
","Newton begins his letter with a description of the production of a prismatic spectrum. Apparently, Newton was the first to use 'spectrum', the Latin for appearance, apparition. He describes the small hole, 1/4 inch diameter, in the window shutter of a darkened room, casting a narrow beam of sunlight onto a prism which cast the spectrum onto a wall 22 feet away. The spectrum was 2-5/8 inches wide and 13-1/4 inches long. The prism was rotated so that angle of incidence of sunbeam onto the prism face was equal to the angle of exitance of the green rays from the opposite prism face; that is, minimum deviation. The spectrum was incident nearly perpendicularly onto the distant wall. In the paper, Newton names five colors: red, yellow, green, blue, and violet. He would later add orange and indigo.||Newton recounts his surprise at the elongation of the spectrum and reports his efforts to find the cause. He finally supposes that the sunbeam is composed of rays with different refrangibility and are thus separated into a spectrum. That is, white light is heterogenous. He tested his supposition with an 'experimentum crucis.' He placed a card with a hole in it behind the prism. The prism could be rotated to move the spectrum over the hole, and so the hole could be made to transmit various colors of light. Twelve feet distant from this hole was placed another card with another hole, behind which was another prism. Light of different colors could thus be made to fall on the second prism. From this he determined that for any one color, the amount of refraction was the same for both prisms. Changing the color involved changed the refraction, but it was always the same for both prisms. Newton concluded: 'And so the true cause of the length of that Image (of the spectrum) was detected to be no other, then that Light consists of Rays differently refrangible, which without any respect to a difference in their incidence, were, according to their degrees of refrangibility, transmitted toward diverse parts of the wall.'||Newton then sets out 13 propositions which present his theory of light and color: 1: Rays having different refrangibility exhibit different colors. 2: Color and refrangibility are inherently linked. 3: Color and refrangibility are not altered by reflection or refraction. 4: Color transformation is only by mixing rays. 5: There are two types of colors, original or simple, and compound. 6: Some simple colors and be produced by mixing others. 7: Whiteness is not a property of any ray. 8: Whiteness is the 'confused aggregate of rays.' 9: The prism produces colors because of their different refrangibility. 10: This is the cause of the colors of the rainbow. 11: Various color phenomena (Lignum Nephriticum, gold leaf, colored glass) are also explained this way. 12: Explains Robert Hooke's blue-red color experiment. 13: Objects have color because they reflect only some of the many colored rays incident on them. The letter ends with Newton's description of using a lens to recombine the colors dispersed by a prism and thus (re)producing white light.","Discovery of the Dispersion of Light and of the Nature of Color (1672)|Sarton, G.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 14, No 2, 1930, pp 326-341.||Experimentum Crucis|Lohne, J.A.|<i>Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 23, No 2, 1968, pp 169-199.||Newton's Prisms and His Experiments on the Spectrum|Mills, A.A.|<i>Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 36, No 1, 1981, pp 13-36.||'A Less Agreeable Matter': The Disagreeable Case of Newton and Achromatic Refraction|Bechler, Z.|<i>The  British Journal for the History of Science<i>, Vol 8, No 2, 1975, pp 101-126.||Newton Defends His First Publication: The Newton-Lucas Correspondence|Westfall, R.S.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 57, No 3, 1966, pp 299-314.||The Reception of Newton's Optical Work|Shapiro, A.E.|In: The Reception of Isaac Newton in Europe, Pulte, H., Mandelbrote, S., editors, Bloomsbury Academic, 2019, 1004 pp, NB: pp 407-414.","A Letter of Mr. Isaac Newton, Professor the the Mathematicks in the University of Cambridge; containing his New Theory of Light and Colors.

Isaac Newton,"Newton, Isaac",,1642-1727," ",An Accompt of a New Catadioptrical Telescope,"Newton's description of his spherical mirror telescope. Prompted by his discovery of chromatic aberration in lenses, he devised his catadioptric telescope.
","Isaac Newton sent his letter describing his reflecting telescope to Henry Oldenburg <i>before<i> the letter describing his new theory of light and color. Oldenburg decided to print the material in the letters in reverse order, the letter on theory first, followed later by the description of the new telescope. Newton's intention was to present his new telescope as a practical manifestation of and test piece for his theory of light and color and to show its superiority to previous theories. Catoptric telescopes had been described early in the century by Bonaventura Cavalieri and Marin Mersenne, and Newton turned to the idea not as a new invention, but as an alternative to lenses as a light-gathering and magnifying mechanism. But the general reaction to his telescope had little to do with chromatic aberration, it was praised for showing how telescopes could be shortened without sacrificing magnification. The account appearing in the Transactions was written by Oldenburg and emphases the compactness of the instrument, rather than any freedom from chromatic aberration. The engraving that accompanied the account showed two images of 'a crown on the weathercock about 300 feet distant', one representing that produced by Newton's mirrored telescope, the other by 'a common tube of 25 inches long'. The point being that the smaller mirrored telescope performed as well as much large instruments. The image of the telescope in the etching accompanying the article was taken from a drawing in a letter Oldenburg had sent to Christiaan Huygens, made from the instrument at the Royal Society. Newton owned a copy of James Gregory's <i>Optica Promota<i> of 1663, and though perhaps influenced by it and the reflecting telescopes it described, Newton adopted a simpler design.||Newton's telescope made a considerable impression at the Royal Society, and immediately elected him a Fellow. Newton and his telescope rapidly become known in Europe. The same general image of the telescope appeared with its description, along with Huygens' comments, in the Journal de S√ßavans in February 1672. The article emphasized the instruments' compactness. At the time of this article and his initial fame, very few knew that Newton had developed a new theory of light color and thus it was not that that ushered Newton onto the world stage, rather it was his telescope and its description in the Transactions.
","Oldenburg's description--based on details in the letter from Newton--gives not only the nature of the telescope, but its construction, and performance. The mirror is of 'bell metal' with a significant portion of arsenic to make it hard, less porous, and better able to take a polish. The figure was spherical, since he reasoned that the resulting spherical aberration would be far less than the chromatic aberration of a lens, so an attempt at a parabolic figure was not made. A small flat oval mirror at the axis reflected the image to an eye-piece to the side of the telescope tube. Focusing was accomplished by a screw that move the concave mirror along the axis of the instrument. At Newton's request, the measurements of the instrument are proved, emphasizing its small size. The accompanying engraved figure shows not only the instrument but the path of rays within it. At the end, Oldenburg summarizes two additional letters Newton sent regarding the telescope; one regarding details of the speculum metal, and another regarding an optical sighting mechanism. Lastly, Oldenburg summarizes a letter from Christiaan Huygens, written in response to Oldenburg's request for comments on Newton's new telescope. Huygens with quite complementary, citing the short focal-length that could be achieved, the high magnification, and the potential to gather more light and produce brighter images than was possible with lenses.","<i>Reflecting Telescope Optics: Basic Design Theory and its Historical Development<i>|Wilson, R.N.|Springer, Berlin, 2007, pp 1-20.||Newton‚Äôs Telescope in Print: The Role of Images in the Reception of Newton‚Äôs Instrument|Dupr√©, S.|<i>Perspectives in Science<i>, Vol 16, No 4, pp 328-359.||'A Less Agreeable Matter': The Disagreeable Case of Newton and Achromatic Refraction|Bechler, Z.|<i>The British Journal for the History of Science<i>, Vol 8, No 2, 1975, pp 101-126.||An Account of the Royal Society's Newton Telescope|A.

","Wynant van Westen, organist and mathematician from Nijmengen, produced a Dutch translation of the <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i>. 'Problems' are presented, some of several parts, with solutions constituting a collection of experiments, apparatus demonstrations, recipes, and parlor tricks in cosmology, optics, perspective, mechanics, statics, practical geometry, fortification and gunnery. Designed to entertain and instruct. The source for the arithmetical problems was Claude Bachet's <i>Problems Plaisans et Delectables<i> of 1612. The problems in geometry are in the Renaissance tradition of 'practical geometry'; geometry applied to surveying, mensuration, and fortification. Many of the other problems come from the tradition of secretes and natural magic, such as Girolamo Ruscelli's <i>De' Secretis del Alessio Piemontese<i> in the edition of 1615. Some of the problems in natural philosophy appear to be from works by Giambattista Della Porta, Girolamo Cardano, and Salomon de Caus. Renaissance books on conjuring and prestidigitation were a source for the <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i>.||Dutch editions appeared at Arnhem and Amsterdam in 1636, 1641, 1644, 1662, 1671, and 1673. Westen's translation of 1636 was of the only the first 91 Problems of the French text of 1626. After Westen's death in 1636 and beginning with the 1641 edition, the Dutch translation presents all three parts. The Dutch edition of 1671 omitted the original 1636 dedication of Westen, substituted one by the Amsterdam printer J.T. Loots-Man, and used the French text of 1669.
","van Westen's Dutch translation of a late edition of Leurechon's <i>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques<i> and like other late editions has a preface to the reader from the author which names some of his sources and the general nature of what he tried to accomplish. This is followed by Part I containing 91 'Problems' on various subjects, including: Arithmetic, Geometry, Optics and Perspective, Music, Cosmographical Matters. The camera obscura, burning mirrors and lenses, plane and curved mirrors, clear and colored looking-glasses, and the rainbow are presented in a rudimentary way. In this and other early editions, the optical material is limited to display and demonstration, with little or no explanation of the phenomena itself. Part II contains 45 Problems on similar subjects, these first appeared in the edition of 128. Part III is the briefest, containing 17 problems in fireworks and artillery. There are a few problems in Part II devoted to optics and projection that have a very different character than the original problems of Part I--more detailed and  explanatory, rather than simply reporting. The problems in Part I and their examinations, and the problems in Part II, never involve mathematics above the simplest geometry, thus maintaining their popular science character.","‚ÅÇ R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques (1624) A Study on its Authorship, Sources and Influence|Heefer, A.|<i>Gibeci√®re<i>, Vol. 1, No 2, 2006, pp. 79-167.",Mathematische Vermaecklyckheden,,Dutch,1673,1650-1675,Dutch¬†organist and mathematicus to the city of Nijmegen,5,1644,,,Amsterdam,Widow of Theunis Jacobsz Lootsman,,,,‚àµ‚Å∏ A-P‚Å∏ Aa-Ff‚Å∏,[ùüôùüû] 1-229 [ùüôùüô] [1-2] 3-55 [ùüù] [1] 2-34 [ùüö],,,Contemporary Vellum,8,150,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1673 Westen - Mathematische Vermaecklyckheden - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,http://books.google.com/books?id=DiplAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false,160,Bubb Kuyper Auctions,52.3728,4.8936
Isaac Barrow,"Barrow, Isaac",,1630-1677," ",Lectiones optic√¶ & Geometric√¶,Elaborate development of the theory of optical images. Includes preliminaries on the nature of light and color and a full mathematical treatment of images formed by mirrors and lenses.,"Isaac Barrow's optics work has its origin in his growing interest in natural philosophy while studying at Cambridge and was expressed in his thesis on the insufficiency of Descartes' geometrical optics--that is, the shortcomings of the mechanical basis for optics. Continental Cartesianism had evolved elaborate mechanical models for light's rectilinear propagation, reflection, refraction, and double refraction; all deduced from a mechanical model of light's nature. Though Barrow considered it necessary to present the briefest summaries of these theories in his lectures, he considered them all hypothetical and inconsequential, since, regarding light's nature, 'proofs cannot be given.' Thus, aside from some material in the first two <i>lectiones<i>, Barrow does not deal with the nature of light. His lectures deal narrowly but completely with optical images, their formation, their size, their placement.||The optical lectures were developed between 1664 and 1669, fulfilling the requirement of the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics, to which Barrow had been appointed in 1663. In 1669 Barrow resigned the Lucasian Chair in favor of Isaac Newton and would have left the lectures unpublished, but John Collins, fellow mathematician, urged him to publish, to which he finally agreed. The work of seeing a manuscript through the press was left to Collins and Isaac Newton. In was in this way that Newton edited and corrected Barrow's lectures for print. The <i>Lectiones Opticae<i> presented a modern theory of images in spherical mirrors and lenses, the location of focal points including those for thick lenses, and a derivation of the radius of the rainbow.||The audience for Barrow's Lectures was small--the mathematics presented was daunting for all but the very learned. Within its small audience, the Lectures were well received. They formed the most advanced treatise on geometrical optics then available and would form the basis and beginning point for Newton's own, later Optical Lectures. References to Barrow's <i>Lectiones Opticae<i> were later made and some of its developments used by Christiaan Huygens, Jakob Bernoulli, David Gregory, Jean-√âtienne Montucla, and Robert Smith.||Barrow's <i>Lectiones Opticae<i> appeared at London in 1669, and again together with the <i>Lectiones Geometricae<i> in 1674, edited by Whewell in 1860, and a translation into English appeared in 1987.
","Barrow's elaborate development of the the theory of optical images is presented in 18 Lectures.  1: Nature and propagation of light. 2: Laws of reflection and refraction. 3: Application of the laws. 4 & 5: Refraction at a plane surfaces. 6 & 7: Reflection at spherical surfaces. 8 & 9: Reflection at convex spherical surfaces. 10: Reflection at concave spherical surfaces. 11 , 12, & 13: Refraction at spherical surfaces. 14: Thick lenses. 15: Images of extended objects. 16: Images of line objects. 17: Curvature of images of lines. 18: Images of line objects by refraction at spherical surfaces.||In lectures 1-3 Barrow presents a hybrid theory of light that combines corpuscular emission with mediumistic pulses, giving him six hypotheses or axioms on which he based his geometric optics: linear propagation, emission from every point on a luminous surface, normal incidence is a special case for reflection and refraction, reflected and refracted rays are coplanar with the incident ray and surface normal, equal angle law of reflection, and sine law of refraction. Barrow invokes 'ray fronts' of Thomas Hobbes, as used by Emanuel Maignan, to derive the laws of reflection and refraction. The heart of the material is in lectures 4-13. He first presents what came to be known as 'Barrow's Principal for Image Location': an image is located at that place from which rays entering the eye appear to diverge. He then establishes his new and fundamental analysis tool: the oblique pencil of rays. With these tools, and often elaborate geometrical analysis, Barrow establishes methods for determining image locations produced by mirrors and refactors with the eye both on and off the optical axis. This allows him to determine the image point after any collection of reflections and refractions at plane and spherical surfaces. All this, in turn, is applied to lenses and focal points and image locations for single or multiple thin and thick lenses. The same method is used in a derivation of the primary rainbow radius and an elegant solution to Alhazen's Problem.||The analysis throughout is detailed, elaborately geometrical, and tediously complete.","‚ÅÇ The Optical Lectures and the Foundations of the Theory of Optical Imagery|Shapiro, A.E.|In: <i>Before Newton: the Life and Times of Isaac Barrow<i>, Feingold M., editor|Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990, pp 105-178.||ùëª <i>Isaac Barrow's Optical Lectures<i>|Fay, H.C. translator, Bennet, A.G., editor|The Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers, London, 1987, 243 pp.||The Works of Isaac Barrow|Hill, A.|Riker, New York, 1845, Vol 1, 628 pp, NB: xxxix-xli.","Archimedis Opera: Apollonii Pergaei Conicorum Libri IIII.

"Claude Francois Milliet Dechales, SJ","Dechales, Claude Francois Milliet SJ",,1621-1678," ",Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus,"A complete course of Mixed Mathematics expressly meant for teaching, becoming a popular, widely-used textbook.
","The origin of Dechales' <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> was his long experience in teaching Mixed Mathematics, from which he had acquired not only an understanding of the audience for such material but also skill in its presentation. In his Preface, Dechales gives the reason for writing the Cursus: He wanted to produce a work for young students that would be used for self-study, that did not presume a previous knowledge of mathematics, and from which they could learn without the need for a teacher or guide. Dechales' purpose informs the content, style, and order of the work. Most of what he considered necessary in mathematics is presented in the first 400 pages of Tome I. In the rest of the work, geometry and the laws of proportions are used most often, along with a little trigonometry. The presentations are clear, sufficiently detailed, and often accompanied by figures which, though relatively simple wood-cuts, are important to the material. No derivations are given, only statements of results or facts, and though advancing no novelties of his own, Deschales exercises considerable discernment, presenting what he held to be the best of the then-current theories and formulations of the topics covered. He presents (and defends), for example, Galileo‚Äôs theory of motion, but generally rejects Cartesianism.||That the work was entirely self-contained and gave presentations of great clarity helped make it popular and widely used. It was, for example, still used as a textbook at the University of Upsala early in the 18th century.||Dechales' <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> was reviewed--in the form of a summary--in the Transactions of the Royal Society in Vol 9, No 110, Jan 1675, pp 229-233.

It covers practical geometry, arithmetic, plane and spherical trigonometry, mechanics, statics, geography, magnetism, military architecture, hydrostatics and fountains, optics, music, pyrotechnics, astrolabes, dialling, astronomy, calendars, algebra, method of indivisibles, and conic sections.||Optics takes up 385 pages of volume 2, presenting Tracts 18-21 covering Optics, Perspective, Catoptrics, Dioptrics, and lastly a Mechanical Digression. The Optics tract is in three books: Suppositions and Vision; Binocular vision; Propagation of Light. The Perspective tract is in six books: Fundamentals; Iconographic projection; Scenographics; Aspects of linear perspective. The Catoptrics tract is in four books: Plane mirrors; Convex mirrors; Concave mirrors; Cylindrical mirrors. The Dioptrics tract is in two books: Refraction and individual lenses; Combined lenses. The Mechanical Digression covers image locations, refracted colors, and aspects of meteorological phenomena.||The material includes: The eye's structure and function, monocular and binocular vision; the nature, propagation, reflection, and refraction of light; plain and curved mirrors and the images they produce, lenses and multiple lenses and the magnified images they produce; the operation of microscopes and telescopes. Dechales deals only briefly with physical optics, giving reasons for reflection and refraction, and most often in very short sections titled 'Digressio Physica.'  Most of the material is geometric optics and the fundamental quantity is the luminous ray. Dechales gives a competent overview of geometrical optics and images but never presents anything as densely mathematical as Barrow's Optical Lectures. However circumscribed by the intended purpose and audience, Dechales' presentations are remarkably clear, and along the way he introduces the term 'virtual image' as companion to 'real image' and so clarifies the physical meaning of image, uses pencils of rays to qualitatively analyze the position and size of images in lensed optical systems, and accurately describes the operation of the magic lantern.||Though dependent on many sources for his material, Dechales rarely cites them. Dechales' optical material includes some that comes from uncited works by Christoph Scheiner, Bonaventura Cavalieri, Gilles Personne de Roberval, James Gregory, and Francesco Eschinardi.","Images: Real and Virtual, Projected and Perceived, from Kepler to Dechales|Shapiro, A.E.|In: <i>Inside the Camera Obscura ‚Äì Optics and Art under the Spell of the Projected Image<i>|Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, preprint 333, 2007, pp 75-95.||<i>A Philosophical and Mathematical Dictiionary<i>|Hutton, C.|London, 1815, Vol I, pp 395-396.","R.P.

"Nicholas Malebranche, CO","Malebranche, Nicholas CO",,1638-1715," ",De la Recherche de la Verit√©,"A philosophical work describing human errors that affect the pursuit of truth: error of the senses, the imagination, and the mind. Book One is devoted to the senses, including vision and optics.","Nicholas Malebranche sets out the general plan for his work at the start of Book one, listing the principal topics: errors of the senses, of the imagination, of pure understanding, of the inclinations, and of the passions, ending with his 'general method for conducting the search after truth.' At the time when he first wrote the work, Malebranche was a thorough Cartesian, particularly regarding the senses. Malebranche's conception of vision and the eye is that of the Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i> of 1637, and light was percussively transmitted pressure or 'tendency to motion' in the plenum. Though Malebranche's interest in optics did not extend beyond an elementary consideration of the nature of light, his ideas on that subject would later be affected by his reading of Huygens, Newton, and Romer's discovery of the finite speed of light. These changes would appear in the edition of 1700 and in their final form in that of 1712.||The first three books of <i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i>, appeared at Paris in 1674. The last three appeared in 1675. Further editions appeared in 1677, 1678, 1681, 1683, 1688, 1700, 1712, 1721, 1735, 1749, 1762, 1772, 1829, and in the Oeuvres of 1842. A Latin translation appeared in 1690 and 1753, English translations in 1694 and 1700, an Italian translation in 1767, and a German translation in 1776.
","<i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i> is fundamentally a philosophical work that sets out a general method for the search after Truth. For Malebranche, such a method means avoiding the errors that can and do arise and so these errors and their sources must be explicated first before the method can be developed. These ideas establish the organization of the work. Book 1: The world is apprehended through the senses, and it is here that the nature and potential problems with visual perception are described. Books 2-5 describes the subsequent errors that can be introduced by the imagination, by the logic and reasoning of pure understanding, by the mind's inclinations and impulses, and by the passions. Book 6 presents the general method for the search after truth.||The Cartesian doctrine of vision is presented in Book 1 and the concept of light as percussively transmitted 'tendency to motion' in the plenum filled with aetherial matter is briefly discussed in Book 6.","‚ÅÇ ùëª <i>The Search after Truth¬†and¬†Elucidations<i>|Lennon, T.M. and  Olscamp, P.J.|Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1997, 775 p.||L'Optique de Malebranche|Duhem, P.|<i>Revue de Metaphysique et de Morale<i>|Vol 23, 1916, pp 37-91.","De la Recherche de la Verit√©.

","Montanari gives a description of the 'dioptric level,' an instrument that allowed extremely accurate leveling, in part because the spirit level was fitted onto a telescope. The telescope was also equipped with a distance-measuring, reticle made from hairs arranged on the focal plane of the eyepiece. The hairs, arranged horizontally, were equally spaced and so a distant rod could be sighted, it's image against the horizontal hairs determined, and a calculation using constants of the instrument would give the distance. This was, essentially, a form of measuring angular subtense. Montanari was sufficiently knowledgeable to understand that Keplerian telescopes (two convex lenses) could have small objects (hairs) placed at the focus and so they and distance objects were in focus at the same time. Knowing the particulars of a set of lenses, the computational constants could be determined from which scaled height--that is, distance--could be determined.","Evolution of mines surveying instruments|Scott, D.D.|<i>Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers<i>, New York, 1902, NB pp 301-302.||<i>Geminiano Montanari<i>|Lugli, M.L.|Edizioni il Fiorino, Modena, 2004, 279 p.||<i>Nel terzo centenario dalla nascita di Geminiano<i>|Bonacini, C.|https://www.liberliber.it/mediateca/libri/b/bonacini/nel_terzo_centenario_dalla_nascita_di_geminiano_montanari/odt/bonacini_nel_terzo_centenario_dalla_nascita_di_geminiano_montanari.odt","La livella Diottrica Del Dott.

","At the end of his preface to the first French edition of the <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> 1671, Jacques Rohault mentions that he was 'preparing a Latin version in favor of foreigners, in whom I dare promise myself a fairly favorable reception.' But Rohault never publish a Latin translation. The first was this very close translation produced by the Geneva physician TheÃÅophile Bonet which appeared at Geneva in 1674 (this edition). It was reprinted at London and Amsterdam in 1682, at Amsterdam in 1691 and 1700 and at London in 1691 with notes by the Franciscan Antoine Le Grand, at Amsterdam in 1708 and Cologne in 1713 with notes by both Le Grand and Samuel Clarke. For use at English universities, Clarke made a second Latin translation that appeared at London in 1697 and preprinted in 1702, 1710, and 1718. It was into these editions of his Latin translation of Rohault that Clarke added every more numerous and lengthy notes, augmenting, supplanting, and eclipsing Cartesianism with Newtonianism.
","Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> is in four parts. Part 1 is in 35 chapters and covers principles of physics, nature of matter, motion and its analysis, forms of matter, heat and cold, the senses of taste, smell, and hearing, and finally the eye, optics, and vision. The Cartesian principles of extension, divisibility, motion, and rest are used to deduce general laws of statics, dynamics, and--via ballistic conceptions  of reflection and refraction--optics. Part 2 is in 29 chapters and covers cosmography, astronomy, selenography, the planets and their movements, the fixed stars, and finally the competing theories of the sun and planets. Rohault plumps for the Copernican as the most rational. Part 3 is in 17 chapters and covers geology in general, including the Earth and things that are part of it, such as the atmosphere, the seas, metals and minerals, fountains, winds, fogs and clouds, rain and hail, snow and frosts, lighting, and finally the rainbow. Part 4 is in 26 chapters and covers anatomy, muscles and movement, blood and circulation, digestion and breathing, and finally maladies and disease.||The optics material covers 115 pages and though patterned closely after Descartes' essay La Dioptrique, it is fully empirical with experiments, demonstrations, and observations reported to test theory and hypothesis. The topics include: the nature of light, color, transparency and opacity. Direct, reflected, and refracted light are demonstrated as well as the simpler forms of image formation by mirrors and lenses. Descartes theory of vision is presented in full. All the optical topics are treated in an elementary but thorough manner. Thus, for example, the focusing properties of spherical convex lenses are demonstrated, but nothing is said of spherical aberration.||Experiment receives a double role: on the one hand, it is shown how it discriminates between conjectures pointing to the ones that are empirically confirmed; on the other hand, it is a powerful pedagogical tool that can convince the reader of explanations given and laws stated.","Rohault's Cartesian Physics|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Cartesian Empiricisms<i>, Springer, 2013, pp 203-226.||Rohault's Traite de Physique and its Newtonian Reception|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Proceedings of the 4th International Conference of the ESHS<i>, 2010, pp 389-394.||The experimental physics of Jacques Rohault|Spink A.|<i>British Journal for the History of Philosophy<i>, Vol 26, No 5, 2017, pp 850-870.||The Study of Early Scientific Textbooks|Sarton, G.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 38, No 3/4, 1948, pp 137-148.||Motion and God in XVIIth Century Cartesian manuals: Rohault, R√©gis and Gadroys|Milani, N.E.|<i>Noctua<i> Vol 2, Nos.1-2, 2015, pp 481-516.",Jacobi Rohaulti Tractatus Physicus.

Anonymous,Anonymous,,," ",Dioptrica Practica,"A manuscript of a course in optics devoted to the construction and use of the telescope and microscope. The manuscript originates from Rome and may have accompanied a course taught by Jesuit at the Collegium Romanum.
","A manuscript of a text presumably used in a course in optics or perhaps mathematics or astronomy. It is likely that the course was one of several small tutorials offered by Jesuits in the Collegium Romanum in the last quarter of the 17th century, perhaps 1670-1680. The text cannot be student notes; the repeated use of first-person singular and the structure and detail of the text suggest it is meant as a teaching guide for a similar course in other Jesuit schools where small tutorials for advanced students were offered. Another copy of this manuscript resides in the Houghton Library at Harvard University; it is in the same hand, with exactly the same text, but in a narrower format and thus contains more pages. The Harvard copy contains a sheet of 10 hand-drawn figures to accompany the text. Other copies are listed at the Biblioth√®que de Toulouse, the Biblioteca Boncompagni and Bibliotheque Slusiane in Rome. It seems likely that these copies were produced by the lecturer or a copyist for use by teachers giving a similar course in another Jesuit school. The extant manuscripts must all have been copied from the same original. The text, and presumably the course which it accompanied, demonstrates the interest in practical optical instruments and their use. The text presumes that convex and concave lenses are available and concentrates on the construction and use of instruments built from them.||World Cat confusingly assigns David P. Wheatland as the author of this text. This is an error; Wheatland was donor of the copy of the manuscript given to Harvard. Other references confuse this text with the <i>L'Occhiale all'Occhio Dioptrica Practica<i> of Manzini and so give it an erroneous, Macclesfield, provenance.
","The manuscript is in seven chapters. Chapter 1: Gives the history of the invention of the telescope, mentioning its Dutch origins and perfection and use by Galileo. Chapter 2: Covers the parts of telescopes and microscopes, particularly the tubes, mountings, and lenses. Although lensing making per se is not described, lens assessment is, including: determining lens figure, focal length, and quality. Chapter 3: The construction of multi-lensed telescopes, both Galilean and Keplerian. This includes sizing the objective, the ocular, and the use of diaphragms or stops. Chapter 4: The ordinary use of the telescope and microscope. This includes mounting, adjusting and focusing, and placement of object being viewed. The use of the telescope in perspective is described. Chapter 5: The use of the telescope in practical geometry such as surveying and measurement. It is here that Rome is explicitly mentioned, as measurement of distances between points in the city are described. Chapter 6: the use of the microscope in practical geometry. Chapter 7: The use of the telescope in astronomy. Sunspots, among other phenomena, are considered here.||The text is entirely practical, with emphasis on the construction of use of telescopes and microscopes. No theory is presented. A description of common telescopes built until about 1660 is given, using both convex and concave lenses. The works of Riccioli, Scheiner, Redi, and Hooke are cited.

"Zacharias Traber, SJ","Traber, Zacharias SJ",,1611-1679," ",Nervus Opticus,"A presentation of very basic optical theory and its elaborate and numerous applications to the design and construction of optical phenomena, displays, devices, amusements, and instruments.","Zacharias Traber's <i>Nervus Opticus<i> has its roots in his work designing and constructing optical displays for the summer palace garden of Archbishop Gy√∂rgy Lippay in Bratislava. Renowned for its mechanical, hydraulic, and optical features, Traber began working on part of the garden in 1648 and did so on-and-off until the bishop's death in 1666. Traber used his knowledge of optics to design and construct camerae obscurae, dioramas, distorting and anamorphic mirrors, 'catoptrical theaters' that generated multiple images, and various dioptric displays including fountains and mists for generating rainbows. The <i>Nervus Optics<i> sets out not only what Traber knows about optics, but--much more importantly--how optical theory can be used to generate all manner of optical instruments, displays, and devices. Following his Preface to the Reader, Traber added a synopsis of the entire work which set out not only the book's content but also principles he used for writing it. He makes clear that he finds most texts off-putting because of 'their prolixity and confusing proofs and demonstrations'. For Traber, optical theory has value only in application. Experience and experiment are uppermost and this, he states, is 'why only three theoretical parts in the three books will be sufficient.' In this regard, there is very little theory and no mathematics or analysis in the Nervus Opticus. All topics are treated descriptively. Thus, even though Descartes ballistic metaphor for refraction is presented, the sine law of refraction is not. Instead, Traber presents Kepler's approximations from the Dioptrice of 1611.||Traber cites the works of many authors, including Aristotle, Euclid, Albertus Magnus,  Giambattista Della Porta, Ren√© Descartes, Antoine Mizauld, Johannes Kepler, Gaspar Schott, Christoph Scheiner, Athanasius Kircher, and Francois Aguil√≥n. With the exception of Schott, these are limited to the first three chapters of each of the three books; that is, the theoretical sections. Schott, and to a less extent Kircher, are the most prominent models for the rest of <i>Nervus Optics<i>. Many of its chapter titles and text can be found in the first volume, on optics and vision, of Schott's <i>Magia Universalis Natur√¶ et Artis<i> of 1657. Traber does not adopt Schott's (or Kircher's) foundation of Natural Magic, but he is, like them, fascinated with optical devices and objects. The frontispiece of <i>Nervus Opticus<i> reflects this emphasis, with putti engaging with a cornucopia--literally--of lenses, mirrors, prisms, and instruments. Traber's manuscript was handed over to the Vienna printer Matthaeus Cosmerovius in 1673. Cosmerovius' death delayed the printing which was eventually taken up by his son Johann Cosmerovius who printed three or four hundred copies in 1675.||Nervus Opticus appeared at Vienna in 1675 and was reissued in 1690 with a new title page.
","Zacharias Traber's <i>Nervus Opticus<i> is in three books. Book 1 is on optics; that is, vision by direct rays but also presents some dioptric phenomena. Topics include: The nature, propagation of light; color of surfaces and the rainbow; eye function; visual species; focusing properties of lenses; use of telescopes, microscopes, and helioscopes. Book 2 in on catoptrics. Topics include: Law of reflections; images in convex and concave mirrors, images produced by interreflection in multiple plane mirrors; burning mirrors; polygonal mirrors; cylindrical mirrors; and 'magia catoptrica' constructions for gardens and entertainment. Book 3 is on dioptrics. Topics include: Refraction and Kepler's approximate law; hypotheses regarding refraction; prismatic colors; lenses and lens making; convex and concave lens properties; operation of the eye's lens; vision with lenses; rays through multiple lenses; magnification by lenses; microscopes and telescopes; lenses of elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic figures; and an Appendix on dialling.||The material on physical optics that is presented in the first few chapters of each book is just sufficient to support applications. It is a hybrid of medieval Perspectiva and the ideas of Kepler and Descartes, with visual species being conflated with optical images. Visual rays and luminous rays are used interchangeably in the text and some complications, such as spherical aberration in mirrors, are not considered at all. The presentation is entirely qualitative with no mathematics or calculations. Most material, by far, is devoted to optical devices, instruments, and entertainment pieces. This is particularly so for the book on catoptrics, where the emphasis is on the production, multiplication, and distortion of images. The material on dioptrics has its emphasis on the production of colors, the prismatic generation of rainbows, and the use of lenses in spectacles, telescopes, and microscopes. The geometrical optics is purely qualitative and uses rays and presumed focal points, rather than image analysis. This is the case regarding the description of non-spherical lenses and  the effects of multiple spherical lenses on rays, which are enumerated and described in qualitative ways, somewhat in the manner of Christoph Scheiner's <i>Rosa Ursina<i> of 1630.","‚ÅÇ <i>Plenus Sapientia: Lippay Gy√∂rgy esztergomi √©rsek pozsonyi kertj√©nek l√°tv√°nyoss√°gai<i> (in Hungarian)[<i>Plenus Sapientia: Spectacles of Archbishop Gy√∂rgy Lippay's Summer Palace Garden in Pozsony<i>]|Ecsedy, A.|<i>M≈±v√©szett√∂rt√©neti √ârtes√≠t≈ë<i>, Vol 62, No 2, 2013, pp 171-232.","Nervus Opticus.

It was prelude to and provided ideas that were incorporated within Brigg's later more famous work the Nova Visionis Theoria, first presented to the Royal Society of London in 1682 and printed in 1686.||This first edition appeared with a dedication to Sir Ralph Montagu. The sheets of this 1676 printing were reused with a new title leaf and bound with the printing of the Nova Visionis Theoria in the first appearance of the latter in 1685 and again in 1686. The <i>Ophthalmo-graphia<i> and <i>Nova Visionis Theoria<i> was read and praised by Isaac Newton and was the source of his knowledge of ocular anatomy and visual physiology.
","The <i>Ophthalmo-graphia<i> presents the anatomy of the eye and the theory of its functioning. Importantly, it presents the first description of the retinal nerve fibers and their convergence upon the optic nerve to form the feature Briggs named the 'optic papilla.' The retinal nerve fibers were thought to vibrate when stimulated by light, the vibrations traveling along the optic nerve to the brain. The other aspects of Brigg's ocular anatomy were modern, with the crystalline lens shown in the correct size, in the correct place, and its function of image generation on the retina made clear. Briggs devotes chapters to eye muscles, veins and arteries, the optic nerve, lacrimal glands, animal eyes, and mentions Marriotte and his discovery of the blind spot.","Dr. William Briggs: Ophthalmic Physician at St. Thomas‚Äô Hospital, London|Winstanley, J.|<i>Survey of Opthalmology<i>, Vol 46, No 1, 2001, pp 81-88.|William Briggd, M.D. ( 1650-1704)|James, R.R.|<i>The British Journal of Ophthalmology<i>, Vol 16, No 6, 1932, pp 360-368.","Ophthalmo-graphia, sive Oculi ejusque partium descriptio Anatomica.","Ophthalmology, or An Anotomical Descipition of the Eye and its Parts.",Latin,1676,1675-1700,"British physician, first specialist in ophthalmology.

Johann Christoph Sturm,"Sturm, Johann Christoph",,1635-1703," ",Collegium Experimentale,"The presentation of mechanistic natural philosophy in which experiment trumps theories and hypotheses. Sixteen experiments, with 16 addenda, are presented and discussed. Three deal with optics including material direct from Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i>.
","The roots of Johann Sturms' <i>Collegium Experimentale<i> are in his studies at Leiden under the renowned pedagogue Burchard de Volder and the experimental basis for his courses in natural philosophy. De Volder had introduced experimental demonstrations into his lectures which took place in a special classroom he had purpose-built. Sturm adopted the same pedagogical ideas and in 1672 established a '<i>Collegium Experimentale<i>' at the University of Altdorf. But Sturm took these ideas further: For him, experiment was the only way to successfully teach natural philosophy and to settle disputed points in natural philosophy between the then-current factions: Aristotelian, Cartesian, Gassendian. In his Preface, Sturm cites Caspar Schott, Robert Boyle, and Otto van Guericke as models for experimental lectures. Following his Preface, Sturm included a Programma Invitatorium (Invitational Proclamation) in which he makes clear the role of experiment, writing that scholars use 'the experimental method, because it is no longer based on the subtleties of empty quarrels and disputes, but searches the recondite recesses of nature itself and rests on experiments which are not conducted according to chance, but are planned.'||Patterned after the Accademia del Cimento in Florence, Sturm describes 16 experiments, performed before 20 'scrutatores naturae'--whom he lists after the Programma Invitatorium and were students of or observers in the Collegium--to attest to the correctness of and conclusions from the experiments. The second half of the book is an Auctaria (Supplement) that revisits, explains, and comments on the experiments and the phenomena investigated. With the publication of the <i>Collegium Experimentale<i>, Sturm inaugurated his experiment-based teaching program.||Aside from a few cases where measurements were made, neither the experiments themselves nor the analysis Sturm gives are attempts to establish mathematical laws or descriptions. Rather, the effort was to find cause-and-effect, isolate general properties, demonstrate principles, or decide between hypotheses.||<i>Collegium Experimentale<i> was summarized and reviewed very positively in the Journal de S√ßavans, Vol 6, No 2, January 1678.The influence of Sturm and the <i>Collegium Experimentale<i> was extensive. These formal experimental sessions were repeated in 1675, 1679, 1681, 1683, and 1684 and were summarized in a second part to the <i>Collegium Experimentale<i> that was published in 1685 in which 15 experiments were described and lists of auditors given for each year. One of the auditors in 1683 was Georg Albrecht Hamberger who would teach at the University of Jena and have Christian Wolff as a student. Wolff, in turn, would take up the experimental pedagogical standard and produce one of the most influential textbooks of natural philosophy of the 18th century.||Though both parts of the <i>Collegium Experimentale<i> could be considered textbooks, they were actually testimonials to Sturm's belief in the experimental method and its role in teaching. Both were preludes to Sturm's textbook, Mathesis Juvenilis, that first appeared in 1699. Both parts of the <i>Collegium Experimentale<i> appeared at NuÃàrnburg in 1685, 1701, and 1715.
","The <i>Collegium Experimentale<i> of 1676 presents experiments, grouped around 16 subjects: 1, The diving bell; 2, the camera obscura and the eye; 3, the barometer; 4, on swimming; 5, hydrostatic phenomena; 6, conclusions from the previous experiments; 7, a 36 foot water barometer; 8, on phenomena observed in small pipes in water; 9, effects with various thermometers; 10, Francesco Lana's air ship; 11, mechanical forces; 12, artificial language; 13, Gerricke's air pump; 14, a hydroscope and chronometer of recent invention; 15, the making of telescopes and microscopes; 16, portable camera obscure and the magic lantern.||For each experiment, the apparatus is described,  observed phenomena are listed, and conclusions or consequences are presented. The 'conclusions' are usually explanations given for the phenomena. In some cases, such as with Lana-Terzi's air ship or Gerricke's vacuum-bells, explicit reference is made to claims or details from the original publication.||Three subject areas deal with optics: The eye and the nature of vision, reflection, refraction, and lenses, including material direct from Kepler's Dioptrice; Microscopes and telescopes, their types, operation and use, and objects viewed with them; The camera obscura and the magic lantern, their construction and operation, and the images obtained. The material on telescopes, microscopes, and magic lanterns is accompanied by large, folded plates of figures, showing the geometric optics involved. The 'Auctaria' gives more detail and extended discussions for some of the phenomena of some of the experiments. The auctarium for the 2nd experiment on the camera obscura and the eye is an extended extract and summary from Johannes Kepler's <i>Dioptrice<i> of 1611.","The Culture of Experimentalism in the Holy Roman Empire: Johann Christoph Sturm (1635-1703) and the <i>Collegium Experimentale<i>|Ahnert, T.|http://sammelpunkt.philo.at/308/||Das <i>Collegium Experimentale<i> sive curiosum und die Anf√§nge experimenteller Naturlehre in Deutschland [The <i>Collegium Experimentale<i> sive Curiosum and the beginnings of experimental natural philosophy in Germany]|Wiesenfeldt, G.|In: <i>Johann Christoph Sturm (1635-1703)<i>|Verlag Harri Deutsch, 2004, pp 184-203.||Experiment in Cartesian Courses: The Case of Professor Burchard de Volder|Nyden, T.|In: <i>4th International Conference of the European Society for the History of Science<i>, Barcelona, 2010, pp 384-390.","<i>Collegium Experimentale<i>, Sive Curiosum, in quo Primaria huius Seculi Inventa & Experimenta Physico-Mathemtica, Speciatim Campanae Urinatoriae, Camerae obscurae, Tubi torricelliani, seu Baroscopii, Antliae Pneumaticae, Thermomertrorum, Hygroscopiorum, Telescopiorum, Microscopiorum, Etc.

Contains the first description of the use of a large convex lens to view a flat image and produce depth perception, the zograscope.
","Kohlans's text contains one of the earliest histories of the magic lantern in Germany, citing Johann Franz Griendel and the earliest manufacturer, showman, and instrument maker in the city of N√ºrnberg, which Johann Zahn identified as one of the centers of magic lantern production in 1686. This development that Kohlhans identified, was a separate magic lantern tradition from that of the Dutch and Danish Christiaan Huygens and Thomas Walgensten. Kohlans is also the first to describe the effect of viewing a flat image through biconvex lens--producing a mild stereoscopic depth effect. This would eventually lead to the instrument called the zograscope.||In the <i>Neu-erfundene mathematische und optische CuriositaÃàten<i>, Kohlhans's optical material is given in the vernacular and strictly in the craft tradition. He describes materials, forming, construction, and manufacture, all with sufficient detail to allow for the instruments to be replicated. Throughout this extensive section on optical instruments (nearly 80 pages) one finds short but critical sections presented in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and transliterated Arabic and Syrian. Kohlhans ends the material on optics with a section titled <i>Secreta Optica<i>. Here he explains his attempt to both honor the tradition of secrets in optical craft and the apparent need for openness in describing optical advances granted by God's grace. He cuts this Gordian knot by presenting the secrets in languages that only the learned will understand and so prevents the secrets from being revealed to the vulgar, which if that happened ‚Äòthen these things would become common and the art contemptible.'

Experiments are presented to show the superiority of binocular vision and the resulting requirements for instruments. Methods for the design, construction, testing, and use of binocular microscopes, telescopes, 'binoculars', and spectacles are given.
","In his <i>La Dioptrique Oculaire<i> of 1671, Ch√©rubin d'Orl√©ans noted the inferiority of monocular vision and refuted the notion that it is more natural and efficacious to use one eye. Aside from questions of stereoscopy, he considered binocular vision superior: with both eyes open, the pupils are larger and 'more rays enter the humors of the eye'--though he does admit that vision is more distinct with one eye. In his Preface to <i>La Vision Parfaite<i>, Ch√©rubin continue to insist that vision is more powerful when both eyes are used, and that to this end binocular optical instruments need to permit the visual axes of the two eyes to converge to a single point on the viewed object, rather than be parallel. He also states in the Preface that he had resolved to make a binocular microscope and because he had succeeded beyond his expectations, he had 'determined to make it the principal subject of the present work.'  <i>La Vision Parfaite<i> describes the first binocular microscope and though it never explicitly considers the potential for stereopsis that binocular vision affords, sections of the book would later be cited by Robert Smith in his <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738 in this regard and by Charles Wheatstone in his work on stereoscopic pictures in 1853. <i>La Vision Parfaite<i> had a reception that ranged from politely cool to antagonistic and prompted Ch√©rubin to write a second part, defending his ideas.||The first part of <i>La Vision Parfaite<i> appeared in 1677. A Latin rendition of the French text of the first part appeared in 1678. A second part appeared in 1681.
","<i>La Vision Parfaite<i> is in four parts. Part 1, by far the longest, is in three sections. Section 1 presents a theory of binocular vision, emphasizing the convergent optical axes of the two eyes. This is followed by descriptions of five experiments with results that support the theory. Section 2 presents refutations of opinions and ideas opposed to the binocular theory, including: parallel optical axes, dominance of one eye, and alternating suppression. Finally, a consideration of why previous binocular systems with parallel axes fail, and what principles are required for proper binocular instruments. Section 3 details the requirements for a binocular telescope, including the optical and mechanical features that are required.   A consideration of binocular vision and optical instruments.

Section 1 is a detailed description of the construction of a binocular microscope including the optical and mechanical components. Section 2 describes the construction of what would now be called binoculars. Part 3 is in three sections. Section 1 describes the construction of spectacles based on the binocular theory of vision. Sections 2 and 3 consider some of the visual effects of binocular vision. Part 4 is in two sections. Section 1 is a manual for the design and construction of the lenses required for  binocular optical systems.

Johann Jacob Heinlin,"Heinlin, Johann Jacob",,1588-1660," ",Synopsis Mathematica Universalis,"Reprinting of the second, posthumous edition of 1663 of Heinlin's elementary and qualitative teaching survey of Mixed Mathematics including: Arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, geography, statics, and optics.","Heinlin's Preface to the Reader in the edition of the <i>Synopsis Mathematica Universali<i> 1653 states that the book was written to re-establish the teaching of Mixed Mathematics at Tubingen after the 30 Years War. What was needed in the public and monastic schools was a survey of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, geography, and optics, suitable for beginning students. Interestingly, the book was not intended for self-study, but--as the Preface states--assumes that students require the guidance of a teacher. Regarding students, teachers must not 'charge their memory with prolix and misunderstood lessons.' Heinlin also makes it clear that the order of material, as presented in the Synopsis, should be followed. Though a mathematics student of Johannes Kepler, and later lecturer in that subject, Heinlin rarely invokes even arithmetic in the Synopsis, and its epitomization of optics contains no mathematics at all.||The new Preface states that the fist edition of the book was highly successfully and had been revised and added to by Heinlin before his death in 1660. Friends and former students worked with the manuscript, added material on geography and introduced a new section on statics.||This printing contains the original dedication and both the author's old and printer's new Preface. Editions appeared in 1653, 1663, and 1679. An English translation appeared at London in 1709 and was reprinted in 1729.
","The <i>Synopsis Mathematica Universalis<i> contains six books: Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Geography, Optics, and Statics. The 130-page optic section is titled 'An Epitome of Optics' and accurately describes the nature of the material. It contains: Ocular anatomy and vision; the nature and propagation of light; color as a modification of light and dark; visual perception of objects, light, shade, and color; catoptrics including plane, curved, and burning mirrors; 'mesoptics' (dioptrics) including simple lenses, atmospheric refraction, and the rainbow. The physical optics material is Aristotelian and Perspectivist, with references made to visual species, the distinction between lux and lumen, color as a 'secondary object of sight' resulting from the mixing of light and dark, and rays having strength varying with their obliquity. The longest section is the first, on direct vision, with detailed and elaborate descriptions of many aspects of visual perception. The sections on catoptrics and dioptrics give little more than definitions and descriptions of reflection and refraction. Throughout, the presentation is elementary, descriptive, qualitative only, and wearyingly prolix. No mathematics is used.","<i>Allgemeines Gelehrten-Lexicon<i>|Christian Gottlieb J√∂cher|Vol 2, col 1325.","Synopsis Mathematica Universalis: Nunc Tertium, Longe emendatius & auctius, Edita.",Universal Mathematical Synopsis: Now a Third (edition) lately corrected and greatly augmented.,Latin,1679,1675-1700,German theologian and mathematician.

DNB cites the book as by Walker",1616-1699," ",Propositions concerning optic-glasses,"Description of a series of experiments and demonstrations with convex and concave lenses, having the format of a laboratory note book or journal.","The attribution to Obadiah Walker is common, but scholarship's best guess is that the work was originally written, and figures sketched by Robert Cooper, mathematician in Pembroke College, Oxford. It then seems likely that  Abraham Woodhead of University College was attracted to the subject and some of Cooper's ideas and so reviewed and prepared the manuscript which was left at his death. Obadiah Walker likely found the manuscript among Woodhead's papers and, as he did with several other of Woodhead's works, saw it through the press with 500 copies printed.","There are 51 experiments and demonstrations, accompanied by explanations; 41 devoted to convex lenses, 10 devoted to concave lenses. These are followed by considerations of image position. The language is idiosyncratic: 'glass' is used rather than 'lens'; 'prospective' rather than 'telescope'; 'conical' and 'circumferential' rays rather than 'convergent' and 'divergent'. After a brief, qualitative consideration of refraction, the analysis considers convex lenses: their focal points, operation of multiple lenses, and generation of images. Though the analysis is detailed, it is not mathematical, with geometry invoked only occasionally, and the results expressed descriptively but very concisely. The whole work having the format of a laboratory note book or journal and not a finished treatise--a technical brown study, as it were. It is, however, an example of early modern science, based on experiment and observation.","<i>Oxford Books<i>|Madan, F.|Oxford, 1931, Vol 3 (Oxford Literature, 1651-1680), pp 370-371.||The History of the Royal Society of London, Volume III|Birch, T.|Philosophical Transactions Supplement, London, 1757, p 499.","Propositions concerning optic-glasses, with their natural Reasons, drawn from Experiments.",,English,1679,1675-1700,"English academic, political and religious activist.

This is the first work in the vernacular on the preparation and properties of the Bologna Stone, all previous work had been published in Latin; much of it speculative, little of it practical.

Cellio experimented to determine the treatment that produced the most sensitive material and how to treat, refine, and make the phosphorescent material more sensitive. This description of Cellio's method includes the furnace which he devised for calcinating the stones, since too little heat was insufficient to activate the stone and too much would destroy the phosphorescent property.","<i>A History of Luminescence<i>|Harvey, E.N.|American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 1957, 692 pp, NB:  pp 315-318.||The Bologna Stone: history's first persistent luminescent material|Lastusaari, M., and others|<i>European Journal of Minerology<i>, Vol 24, No 5, pp 885-890.","Il Fosforo O' vero La Pietra Bolognese Preparata per rilucere fra l'ombre Fatica di Marc Antonio Cellio Dell' Accademia Fisicomattematica de Roma, E dal medemo consecrata All' Eccellentissimo Prencipe Signor D.

Johann Stephan Kestler,"Kestler, Johann Stephan",,fl 1675," ",Physiologia Kircheriana experimentalis,"A selection and editing of demonstrations, apparatus, and experiments from Kircher's books. The most numerous are from the work on Light and Shadow, with brief descriptions and many of the original figures. The preface is long essay attempting to address Kircher's critics.","Johann Stephan Kestler, along with Gaspar Schott and Gioseffo Petrucci, was one of the principle defenders and promoters of Athanasius Kircher's works and reputation late in his life. In the nearly 50 years Kircher had been writing books, experimental science had arisen in Europe, and Kestler's compilation was an attempt to extract, summarize, and re-present Kircher as an experimenter and his work as experimentally-based. Kircher promoted it to the potential Dutch publisher as a work of particular relevance, given the interest in such compilations--such as that from the Florentine Accademia del Cimento or the works of Robert Boyle. Kestler himself was completely unknown and the fact that his compilation appeared in print evidences the publisher's trust in the name of Kircher. Kestler's <i>Physiologia<i> of 1680, Giorgio de Sepibus's <i>Romani Collegii Musaeum Celeberrimum<i> of 1678, and Gioseffo Petrucci's <i>Prodromo Apologetico<i> of 1677,  were all meant to defend and rehabilitate Kircher's experimental, collecting, and Egyptological work.||Kestler's preface gives the ostensible reason for the work: to refute Kircher's critics and assemble a collection his most important experimental work. In the Preface, Kestler briefly summarizes criticisms of Kircher's work and dismisses them and their authors as dishonorable. But he writes no specific refutations, simply relying on the sheer amount of compiled material to tip the scales. The <i>Physiologia Kircheriana<i> brings together 337 experiments from Kircher's publications with an emphasis on the Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae. Kestler edited and assembled near verbatim extracts from Kircher's books to accompany the many figures and, compared the well-known and wearying prolixity of the original works, Kestler's summaries are clear and concise--whatever the value of the information itself. Kestler's <i>Physiologia Kircheriana<i> was produced with the same opulence as many of Kircher's later and most famous productions.||Though 'Experimentum' is used throughout the <i>Physiologia Kircheriana<i> to label the individual pieces, it is not a word found in, for example, the <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae<i>. They are actually demonstrations, often involving a piece of apparatus, to show a phenomenon. The use of 'Experimentum' was, evidently, part of Kestler's attempt to recast Kircher's work as experimental. But even in their late 17th century context, these would not have been considered hypothesis-testing or phenomena-exploring exercises; rather, they were demonstrations of what Kircher had always considered expressions of the natural magic that drove, connected, and explained the natural world.
","The <i>Physiologia Kircheriana<i> is in 7 books. Book 1: 'Centrographography', dealing generally with the center of things, including the Earth, the cosmos, central motions, placement and measurement on a sphere. Book 2: A miscellany including the nature of motion of the sea, horology, hydrology, chemistry, insects, and vegetables. Book 3: Light and Shadow. Book 4: Magnetics. Book 5: Sound and Music. Book 6: Ancient mechanics of Egypt. Book 7: Miscellany including ballistics and pyrotechnics.||Book three contains extractions and editings from the second edition of Kircher's <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae<i> of 1671. It is in five sections. Section 1: The nature and production of color. Section 2: Light rays, light of the Sun and Moon, pin-hole projections. Section 3: Analogies between color and tones. Section 4: Optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics devoted to horology. This section includes eye-function.

"Jean-Baptiste Du Hamel, CO","Du Hamel, Jean-Baptiste CO",,1624-1706," ",Operum Philosophicorum,"Contains Du Hamel's <i>Astronomia Physica<i>, A work on the nature of light and colors and planetary astronomy, and <i>De Meteoris et Fossilibus<i>, a summary of meteorological phenomena and a consideration of the nature and Use of things excavated from the ground. 
","Du Hamel's work on light and color is a summary of then-current theories of Gassendi and Descartes set against traditional Aristotelian teaching. 'Modern' theories are considered, explained, and found wanting. His work on planetary astronomy has its root in his early <i>Elementa Astronomia<i> of 1643 and considers: the nature and motion of celestial bodies; various theories of the motion of the earth, moon, and sun; the fixed stars; and various aspects of practical observational astronomy. Both the optical and astronomical material is presented in the form of a Galilean dialogue involving Simplicius (expressing the views of La Chambre), Meander (expressing the views of Descartes), and Theophilus (the views of Honor√© Fabri).||Though Du Hamel had a considerable reputation during his life--first secretary and historian of the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences--his works of this type were of little influence, being essentially summaries and reactionary defenses of Aristotelianism. Nevertheless, and for that very reason, the <i>Astronomia Physica<i> marks and documents the mounting struggle against Cartesianism in France.||Du Hamel's work on meteorics and excavated things (earths, stones, gems, and metals) was written in defense of long-held Aristotelian teachings and as a bulwark against the rising tide of Cartesianism and the 'new chemistry' based on elements rather than differing aggregations of fundamental corpuscles.||Both <i>Astronomia Physica<i> and <i>De Meteoris et Fossilibus<i> appeared in 1660 and again in this opera omnia. Their republication here is an indication of the persistence of Aristotelian teaching late in the 17th century.","<i>Astronomia Physica<i> is in two books. Book 1: On Light and Color; Book 2: On the Nature and Motion of Celestial Bodies. The book on light and color (60 pages) has four chapters. Chapter 1: On the Nature of Light; Chapter 2: On the Motion of Light; Chapter 3: On the Cause of Light; Chapter 4: On the Nature and Diversity of Color.||Chaper 1 presents the Peripatetic theory of light with the distinction between lux and lumen, the Epicurean theory of Gassendi in which light is an effluvium continuously emitted by luminous objects, and the Cartesian in which light an impulse in an aetherial substance that fills the plenum. All are rejected and the Aristotelian theory is defended. Chapter 2 presents light diffusing from all points on a luminous object, until it strikes an opaque surface and is reflected, or a transparent surface and is refracted. Various laws of and mechanisms for refraction are presented. Chapter 3 briefly examens the Aristotelian causes of light and the nature of vision. Chapter 4 presents a color theory similar to La Chambre, with color being fixed and inate and the distinguishing between real and apparent colors is incorrect. The number and sequence of colors is also discussed.||The material is presented in the form of a Galilean dialogue involving Simplicius (expressing the views of La Chambre), Meander (expressing the views of Descartes), and Theophilus (the views of Honor√© Fabri). The arguments made by Meander are, by far, the weakest. The presentation is entirely descriptive, no mathematics of any kind is used.||Appended at the end of Book 2 are a series of papers by Petit on the solar eclipse visible from Paris on 14 November 1639, on magnetic dip, and on the system of the world.||De Meteoris et Fossilibus is in two books. Book 1: On Meteorics. Book 2: On the Nature, Cause, and Use of Things Excavated. Book 1 has five chapters: On meteorics in general and their material; On the sources of the heat and salt of the oceans and seas; On the influence of the ground and air; Fiery meteorics; The rainbow, corona, and other apparent influences. Book 2 has 12 chapters: The principles and causes of fossils in general; Types of earth; On salt and niter; Other salts in general; Sulfur and bitumen; Stones in general; Different types of stones; Gems; Metals in general; Separation of precious metals; Preparation of metals; Uses of metals. The Aristotelian views of La Chambre on nature of light, color, and the rainbow are aggressively presented, and those of Descartes weakly so. All in the form of a classic scholastic dialog involving Menander, Simplicius, and Theophilus.","De kleurtheorie van de Aristotelianen en de opvattingen van De la Chambre, Duhamel en Vossius in de periode 1640‚Äì1670 (in Dutch)|MacLean, J.|<i>Scientiarum Historia<i>, Vol 10, 1968, pp 209-225.||<i>The Rainbow: From Myth to Mathematics<i>|Boyer, C.

Abb√© Edme Mariotte,"Mariotte, Abb√© Edme",,1620-1684," ",La Nature des Couleurs,"Presentation of a long series of experiments and analyses probing the cause, nature, and appearance of color. Mariotte presents correct theories for atmospheric halos and arcs but famously fails to replicate Newton's Experimentum Crucis.","<i>La Nature des Couleurs<i> has its origin in experimental work Mariotte began in 1677 on the rainbow, lenses, and effects of small apertures, and the reports of this work he began presenting to the French Royal Academy of Sciences in 1678 . In 1679 Pierre de Carcavi, mathematician and secretary of the National Library of France, proposed that Mariotte, along with mathematician and astronomer Philippe de La Hire and astronomer Jean Picard produce a full treatise on optics for the Academy. Though the collaboration never took place, Mariotte was prompted to present a draft of <i>La Nature des Couleurs<i> to the Academy later that same year. He continued to work for two years on what would become his 'Fourth Essay on Physics', publishing it in 1681.||<i>La Nature des Couleurs<i> presents an extensive catalog of experimental results on refraction, prismatic colors, the composition, shape, and intensity of spectra, and the geometric conditions involved. Using these results, Mariotte examined Descartes' proposal of variously rotating particles, Newton's proposal of the heterogeneity of white light, and the much older idea that light is modified by interaction with material such as water or glass. Descartes' rotating particles imply color patterns contrary to observation and Newton's demonstration of the monochromatic nature of already-dispersed light--his famed 'experimentum crucis'--fails to be duplicated. Rejecting these theories, Mariotte adopts eight behaviors he observed in his experiments and treats them as principles. These, in turn, are then used to account for various optical phenomena, culminating in his complete account of the rainbow. Mariotte's work on the rainbow typifies the care, detail, and craftsmanship he brought to experiments, by which he found, for example, the effect that temperature had on water and air's index of refraction and so explaining variations in the rainbow's angular size.||Mariotte's reputation as an experimenter was unequaled and unquestioned, and so his conclusion that 'the ingenious hypothesis of Mr. Newton must not be accepted' became, in France at lease, the last word on the subject. Mariotte's experiment and conclusion would long be cited, referenced as late as 1713 in the Acta Eruditorum and beginning with the 3rd edition of Du Hamel's <i>Philosophia Vetus Et Nova<i> which was in wide use until 1700. It would not be until 1715 and John Theophilus Desaguliers' successful demonstration of the Newtonian experiment to a delegation from the French Academy, that the Newtonian notion of heterogeneous light was reconsidered in France. In his preface to 1720 edition of his French translation of the Opticks, Pierre Coste reported that Desaguliers' experimental demonstration was successfully repeated in Paris in 1719. That, and Coste's book itself, marks the time when the long-standing effect of Mariotte's experiment ended.||Editions appeared at Paris in 1681 and in the Oeuvres at The Hague in 1740.
","<i>La Nature des Couleurs<i> is in two parts. The first and longest deals with the origin of colors generated by refraction, the attempt to establish principles, and the subsequent application to meteoric optical phenomena, including halos and the rainbow. the second part is a compilation and overview of object colors.||The first part begins with four 'suppositions' and accompanying 'explications'  that review the basic aspects of reflection and refraction at the interface of transparent material of different density. This is followed by three experiments, each with many parts, that demonstrate the generation of colors by refraction. It is here that Mariotte repeated some of Newton's color experiments, replicating most of them. But he also tested color dispersion in two steps and found that the second appeared to further modify or separate colors, prompting the rejection of Newton's hypothesis of heterogeneous white light. Mariotte admits to establishing no general laws (he considers the sine law of refraction as unproven) but allows that experimentation establishes eight principles that can subsequently be used in the analysis of refractive optical phenomena. The most extensive and detailed (by far) of these is that of the rainbow, but coronas, halos, and false suns are considered as well.||The second part is considerably briefer than the first, less detailed, less organized and not driven by application. It is in four discourses and is essentially a compilation of what was known about surface colors.||For Mariotte, there are two types of colors: fixed or permanent, and apparent. The former is object color, the latter is that produced by light's modification by a prism or drop of water. Colors produced by refraction remain a phenomenon of light-modification, caused by interaction with transparent substances and not, as Newton had it, the manifestation of varying intrinsic properties that refraction separates. For Mariotte, primary colors were red, blue, and yellow, with 'blue' used for what Newton named 'indigo' and green not being primary but blue and yellow mixed.","La Trait√© de la nature des couleurs, de Mariotte|Acloque, C.|In: <i>Mariotte, Savant et Philosophe, Analyse d'une Renomme√©<i>|J.

"Pierre Ango, SJ","Ango, Pierre SJ",,1640-1694," ",L'optique,"Developed from notes left by Ignace-Gaston Pardies, a consideration of the propagation of light. The propagation of light is conceived as traveling waves, but other aspects of light and color are treated in the way of Aristotle.
","Pierre Ango's <i>L'Optique<i> is based on a manuscript written by his coreligionist Ignace Gaston Pardies. The manuscript, begun around 1670 and title 'On the Motion of Undulations', is mentioned by Pardies in the Preface to his <i>La Statique<i> of 1673. He mentions conjectures on the propagation of light, proposing aethereal waves analogous to those of sound in air and how such wave would explain many properties of light and colors. The work is referred to in a way that implies it was finished and would be published. Though never published, it was known to Christiaan Huygens and inherited by Pierre Ango.||The result of Ango's simplifying and editing was a consideration of the propagation of light, firmly grounded in the analogy to sound and water waves, based on Pardies' own research into harmonic motion. Beginning with an analogy to sound, the propagation of light is conceived as traveling waves and the propagation, reflection, and refraction are analyzed using the properties of waves. Central to this analysis was Pardie's association of light rays with the perpendiculars to wave fronts. Included in the application of wave-front analysis was a demonstration of the sine law of refraction. Though waves were central to the analysis of propagation, other aspects of light and color were treated in the way of Aristotle and shows Pardies eclecticism involving Aristotle, Descartes, Gassendi, and others.||Importantly, though Pardies' theory of light was a significant advance, it was but one application of his general theory of undulations which was, in turn, part of Pardies' studies in mechanics, and so was purely kinematic.
","Pierre Ango's editing of Ignace Gaston Pardies optics manuscript is in three books. Book 1: Properties of light explained by wave motion. Book 2: How vision is accomplished. Book 3: Methods to aid and perfect vision.||Book 1 begins by using water waves to establish the properties of wave propagation. Reflection at planar and curves surfaces, rectilinear propagation, and what would now be called superposition. Reflectors of conic sections were used to demonstrate that undulations produced such surfaces well-known focal properties. A long section on sound waves follows, including a derivation of the sine law of refraction. Finally, light is presented as undulations produced by luminous bodies in the all-pervading aether. Like air and water waves, undulations are presented as purely local displacements, no transport of material, be it air, water, or aether, takes place. Luminous rays are associated with perpendiculars to wave fronts. Color is treated in the peripatetic manner: that is it is the result of the mixing of white and black. Book 2 presents a Cartesian explanation of vision, beginning with a consideration of refraction, the focal properties of lenses, and image generation. Book 3 builds on the material in Book 2, considering the images received by the eye that are produced by single and multiple lenses, of both convex and concave figure. This includes the telescope, microscope, and spectacles. The material in Books 2 and 3 is descriptive only, no mathematical analysis is presented.","‚ÅÇ Kinematic Optics: A Study of the Wave Theory of Light in the Seventeenth Century|Shapiro, A.E.|<i>Archive for History of Exact Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 2/3, 1973, pp 134-266, NB: pp 209-218.||The Analogy between Light and Sound in the History of Optics from the ancient Greeks to Isaac Newton.

Disputations are presented which consider the old and new views of Aristotle, Gassendi, and Descartes.","Du Hamel's <i>Philosophia Vetus Et Nova<i> has its origins in the general course he taught at the Coll√©ge du Plessis in the 1660s and 1670s. By the late 1670s, the alarm caused by the rise of the teaching of Cartesian mechanical philosophy in France prompted church, school, and king to attempt to stem the tide. French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert ordered DuHamel's course material to be published as a textbook for colleges. It would be widely used for 25 years. Though generally a reactionary, DuHamel's work in natural philosophy was characterized by accommodation of old and new ideas, producing a mix of the Peripatetic and the Cartesian. Thus, De Hamel's text presents modern natural philosophical phenomena and concepts supported by an eclectic blur of Descartes' mechanical analogies and metaphysics, and Scholastic forms and distinctions. For many of the details regarding phenomena and concepts, Du Hamel refers the reader to Jacques Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i>.||Published in four volumes, the <i>Philosophia Vetus Et Nova<i> was a universal course in philosophy covering logic, metaphysics, moral philosophy, and general and special physics.

After a brief consideration of the nature of refraction, the explanations of Descartes and Mariotte of the rainbow are given, with light refracted by and reflected in rain drops and color resulting from light mixing and interacting with water. Vision is described in Chapters 5-7, Dissertation 3, Tract 1, Part 3. The ocular anatomy is from Christoph Scheiner and the visual process from Descartes. Finally, aspects of perception are considered, including perceptions of distance and size. Optics and the nature of light is described in Chapters 5-10, Dissertation 4 of Tract 1, Part 3. The nature of light is described in Scholastic terms, including the transmission of visual species. Reflected light is treated with Euclidian geometry and refracted light with Descartes' ideas and used to describe the action of lenses. Rays are traced through lenses to show how telescopes and microscopes produced magnified images. Finally, some color phenomena are presented from Mariotte's and Boyle's books on the subject. Color is described as disturbed or mixed light, having interacted with water or glass. In all cases, the treatment is elementary but thorough and contemporary, and is often a hybrid of Aristotle, Gassendi, and Descartes.","The Moment of No Return: The University of Paris and the Death of Aristotelianism|Brockliss, L.|<i>Science & Education<i>, Vol 15 No 2-4,  2006, pp 259‚Äì278.","Philosophia Vetus Et Nova.

Gotfried Leibnitz,"Leibnitz, Gotfried",,1646-1716," ","Unicum optic√¶, catoptric√¶, & dioptric√¶ principium","Leibnitz's article in the Acta Eruditorum deriving the equal angle law of reflection and the sine law of refraction from his assumption that light travels that path, among all possible paths, that offers the least 'resistance.'
","Leibnitz's article in the Acta Eruditorum of 1682 is the second time he published on the question of the principle for optical laws. His <i>Leges Reflexionis et Refractionis Demonstratae<i> of 1671 attempted a ballistic explanation--successful for reflection but not for refraction. In the Acta Eruditorum article of 1682, Leibniz abandons any consideration of mechanics and derives the equal angle law of reflection and the sine law of refraction from his assumption that 'light shining from a point arrives at an illuminated point by the easiest of all ways.' This is given as 'the first principle of optics.' Geometry and differential calculus are used to show how the principle leads to both optical laws and so Leibniz calls it a 'unitary principle.' He sided with Pierre Fermat against most Cartesians and assumed the slower speed of light in denser materials. Leibniz's innovation is to invoke the 'ease' of a light path: the distance of a path multiplied by its resistance. This is distinct from the shortest path. Leibniz's approach can be considered that of 'optimality', as opposed to a Cartesian mechanical one. Leibnitz is gratified that his analysis leads to Snell's sine law of refraction and even though Descartes' analysis came to the same end, it is considered flawed because of its mechanical foundation. Leibnitz's article opens the dispute on the principle of least action in the 18th century.
","Leibnitz's article in the <i>Acata Eruditorum<i> derives the equal angle law of reflection and the sine law of refraction from the assumption that 'light shining from a point arrives at an illuminated point by the easiest of all ways.' The assumptions is stated at the very beginning of the article and is considered a first principle. As part of this principle, the 'ease' of a light path is defined as the distance of a path multiplied by its resistance. For the case of reflection, geometry is used to express the path length between the source and illuminated points as a function of possible points on reflecting plane. Minimization using differentiation gives the path of greatest 'ease' and which exhibits equal angles of incidence and reflection, a result known since Euclid and verifying Leibniz's method. For the case of refraction, the source and illuminated points are in media of difference densities, and to the 'ease' of any path must take into account by summing two paths, each in a different medium. Geometry is again used to establish a function that expresses the total 'ease' of the path as the point on the media boundary is moved. Minimization by differentiation is used again to find the path. and it accords with the sine law of refraction. Importantly, Leibniz's procedure gives the correct result regardless of which medium is the more dense.","‚ÅÇ <i>Optics, Catoptrics and Dioptrics from a Single Principle<i>|Bruce, I., Translator and editor, 2014|http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/leibnizcontents.html||Leibnitz on Optics|McDonough, J.K.|In: <i>The Oxford Handbook of Leibniz<i>|Sprinter, 2014.","Unicum opticae, catoptricae, & dioptricae principium.

Philippe de La Hire,"de La Hire, Philippe",,1640-1718," ",Sectiones Conicae,"La Hire's work on conic sections, with the significant use of Descartes' analytic geometry.","La Hire was a pupil of Girard Desargues and this work on conic sections is based on the teaching of Desargues. La Hire had published earlier works on curves and conic sections: the <i>Nouvelle m√©thode en g√©om√©trie pour les sections des superficies coniques et cylindriques<i> of 1673 and the <i>Nouveaux √©l√©ments des sections coniques: Les lieux g√©om√©triques: Les constructions ou effections des √©quations<i> of 1679. The present work is a culmination and extension of La Hire's work in the field of conic sections and the significant application of Descartes' analytic geometry. In his Preface La Hire writes of his decision to write the present work: 'I had decided to dispose in a safe order, what had been discovered by me a few years before and I had tried at the same time to bring together what I had encountered in the writings of the ancients and the moderns, who turned with praise to this greater part of Geometry.'","La Hire provided an exposition of the properties of conic sections. He began with their focal definitions and applied Cartesian analytic geometry to the study of equations and the solution of indeterminate problems; he also displayed the Cartesian method for solving certain types of equations by intersections of curves. La Hire's work summarizes the progress achieved in analytical geometry during half a century and contained some interesting ideas, among them the possible extension of space to more than three dimensions.

Scheibler wrote a text that was intended to accompany a complete course in philosophy, providing the barest overview of the several areas it covered.

Joahnn Heinrich Schweizer,"Schweizer, Joahnn Heinrich",Johann Henrici Suiceri,1646-1705," ",Compendium Physic√¶,"A beginner‚Äôs introduction to physics, with material presented in brief question and paragraph answer form. The small sections on vision and the nature of light are principally Aristotelian, with a mention of Descartes' notion of a 'tendency to motion' regarding light propagation.","The 'Methodo Erotematica' of the title describes the methods of presentation: by asking and answering rhetorical questions. The <i>Compendium Physic√¶<i> is essentially a dictionary of natural philosophy, written for beginners, and designed to give an overview of many topics, without resorting to technical details or to mathematics. The 'Brief and Succinct Theater of Theoretical Philosophy' serves as an introduction and gives an elementary overview of Aristotelian philosophy, method, categories, and terms. Its 59 numbered paragraphs are each devoted to a single idea, word, or concept. Editions after 1691 did not include this introduction. In the peripatetic manner, physics is divided into general and particular, and for many, thought not all, topics, both the Aristotelian and Cartesian idea or theory is presented. Schweitzer's text merely presents and describes, there is no disputation about or siding with either the Aristotelian or the Cartesian.||Editions appeared at Amsterdam and Basel in 1685, at London 1687, at Basel in 1691, at Amsterdam in 1695, at Marburg in 1696, at Frankfurt in 1709, 1715, and at Link√∂ping in 1725.
","The book contains a series of short questions on various subjects which are answered in a (usually) very short paragraph.  Though the range of subjects considered in this question-answer process is considerable, in keeping with the book's intent, nothing is considered in detail. Subjects include air, animals, water, metals, comets, solar and lunar eclipses, stars, the elements, herbs, man, light, magnets, clouds and rain, planets, the Earth, minerals, and light and vision. The order of presentation has only a very slight structure, so the index is essential for using the book.||The brief material on light is a hybrid of the Aristotelian distinction between lux and lumen, and the Cartesian idea of percussive propagation and vortices. Similarly, a hybrid of luminous rays and visual species is used to describe the visual process. All material is qualitatively descriptive; there is no mathematics nor are figures used.","A book from the collection of John Ellis (c. 1710‚Äì1776), naturalist, now in the library of Isaac Norris held in Dickinson College, Pennsylvania, USA|Wyse Jackson, P.N.|<i>Annals of Bryozoology 2: Aspects of the History of Research on Bryozoans<i>|International Bryozoology Association, Dublin, 2008, 442 pp, NB: pp 427-434.|http://www.researchgate.net/publication/264383617_A_book_from_the_collection_of_John_Ellis_c_1710-1776_naturalist_now_in_the_library_of_Isaac_Norris_held_in_Dickinson_College_Pennsylvania_USA",Compendium Physic√¶ Aristotelico-Cartesian√¶. in usum tironum methodo erotematica adornatum.: cui pr√¶figitur breve & succinctum philosophi√¶ theoretic√¶ theatrum.,"A Compendium of Aritotelian-Cartesean Physics, Prepared for the use of Beginners by the Method of Questions.

Johann Zahn,"Zahn, Johann",,1641-1707," ",Oculus Artificialis,"A complete treatment of the construction and use of lensed optical instruments. Presented in three 'Fundamenta', that is, bases: The physical, the mathematical, and the practical or mechanical.
","In his Preface to the reader, Johannes Zahn adopts the word 'Teledioptrica' to indicate generally the art, craft, science, and practice of using lenses to extend, enhance, and correct vision. For Zahn, teledioptrics includes magnification by telescope and microscope, vision correction by spectacles, image capture by the camera obscura, and image projection by the magic lantern. He cites the benefits that teledioptrics has brought to man in peace, war, natural philosophy, economy, and medicine. And so, he makes clear the purpose and reason for his book: to describe in a full and complete form, all aspects of teledioptrics. The presentation is in three 'bases': the physical or natural basis including the eye, vision, color, the nature of light, and image formation; the mathematical basis of dioptrics including refraction, materials, lens design, compound lenses, and images from lenses; and the practical or mechanical basis including lens figuring, grinding and polishing equipment and methods, instrument construction, and the making of spectacles, telescopes, microscopes, camera obscurae, and projectors.||Zahn's references are extensive and he was in clear command of both the theory and practice of dioptrics. His teacher of practical optics (and co-religionist) was the microscopist Johann Franz Griendel von Ach and he is noted throughout the <i>Oculus Artificialis<i>, particularly regarding microscopes and the magic lantern. Griendel, in turn, would recommend the <i>Oculus Artificialis<i> to readers of his Micrographia Nova of 1687. Zahn's first-hand knowledge of practical optics is apparent, and though particularly so in the third Fundamentum, it informs the entire work. The result is an emphasis on application and practice that makes the <i>Oculus Artificialis<i> a handbook of optical instruments. Theory is presented in sufficient detail to make concepts clear and to support applications, but rather than equations for lens design, for example, Zahn provides elaborate tables.||The three Fundamentum appeared in separate volumes, though are usually found bound together. The first and second Fundamenta appeared in 1685, the third in 1686. A second edition appeared in 1702.
","A synopsis of all three Fundamenta of the work precedes a detailed list of the contents. The first Fundamentum covers the physical basis for teledioptrics and is in three parts. Part 1 includes the nature and structure of the eye and its parts. Part 2 covers the nature and properties of vision and visible objects, including the nature and properties of light, reflection and refraction, and color. Part 3 covers vision itself and the optical function of the eye, including light through small apertures, image formation in the eye, indistinct vision, and aspects of visual perception.||The second Fundamentum covers the mathematical basis of dioptrics and is in three parts. Part 1 covers the materials and forms of transparent materials, suitable for teledioptrics. This includes glass and its properties, refraction in general, refraction in lenses of various figures, foci and image formation, and tables of lens sizes, curvatures, and focal lengths. Part 2 covers the functioning of combination of lenses and their effect of vision (what Zahn terms the 'natural eye'), polygonal lenses, and the construction of a 'material eye'; that is, a model of the human eye and its uses. Part 3 covers the function of various instruments including microscopes, telescopes, polemoscopes, binoculars, the camera obscura, and the magic lantern. The Fundamentum ends with a concise summary and overview of all its material: Refraction in general; the convex lens with its various modes of use and applications; the concave lens with its modes and uses; the meniscus lens; the focal properties of spheres and half-spheres; combinations of convex lenses; combinations of concave and convex lenses; microscopes; 'optical tubes' in general; telescopes of various types.||The third Fundamentum covers the practical and mechanical aspects of teledioptric instruments and is in five parts. Part 1 covers the grinding of convex and concave spherical surfaces, including the processes, equipment, and machines. Part 2 covers the properties of glass, figuring and polishing surfaces, and non-spherical figures. Part 3 covers the use and application of multiple lenses in various optical instruments, including microscopes, telescopes, and spectacles. This part includes aspects of the metal works required for optical instruments. Part 4 is devoted to astronomical telescopes, including aspects of their construction and use. Part 5 is devoted to microscopes and to magic lanterns and other optical projections, including horological applications.||The ocular anatomy of Fundamentum 1 reflects the latest contemporary knowledge, and although the physical optics presented is Peripatetic, (Descartes is not mentioned), luminous rays emerge has the principle, practical description of light. They are used as the mechanism to explain vision and the camera obscura. Theory regarding refraction at the beginning of Fundamentum 2 is very brief and is quoted from Maignon and Dechales; practical measurement aspects come from Kepler. Though the sine law of refraction is quoted, tables of angles of refraction are given, in keeping with the handbook-nature of the work. The general geometric optical properties of lenses are derived in detail using the sine law, trigonometry, and geometry to relate surface radius and focal point. The practical result are the magnification and image-place properties of lenses, which are presented in tables. The section on the effects of multiple lenses, including that of the eye, is particularly detailed and considers spectacles for indistinct vision and magnification by lenses. Fundamentum 2 concludes with a description of an optical model of the human eye, followed by a long series of applications of magnification and image-placement properties of lenses to optical instruments. Interestingly, the Fundamentum ends with a outline summary of all the material it contains. Though Zahn cites Cherubin d'Orleans extensively in Fundementum 3, it is clear that it is not just a compilation of other works but is informed by Zahn's own experience making optical instruments. This includes all aspects of lens making including glass, grinding, figuring and polishing, the use of hand tools, various machines and lathes, and lens testing. Detailed construction instructions and examples are given for microscopes, survey and astronomical telescopes, binoculars, solar projectors, elaborate camerae obscurae, and magic lanterns.","Projecting Nature in Early-Modern Europe|Gorman, M.J.|In: <i>Inside the Camera Obscura ‚Äì Optics and Art under the Spell of the Projected Image<i>|Max Planck Institute for the History of Science Prepint 333, 2007, pp 31-50.||<i>A Survey of the Newtorks Bringing a Knowledgge of Optical Glass-Working to the Londong Trade, 1500-1800<i>|Mc Connell, A.|Whipple Museum of the History of Science, 2016||The origins of the magic lantern in Germany: an example of the use and mis-use oftechnological argument in media history|Rossell, D.|In: <i>Die Medien und ihre Technik.

"Claude Francois Milliet Dechales, SJ","Dechales, Claude Francois Milliet SJ",,1621-1678," ",Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus,"Second edition of the <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> of 1674; a complete course of Mixed Mathematics expressly meant for teaching, it became a popular, widely-used textbook.
","The origin of Dechales' <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> was his long experience in teaching Mixed Mathematics, from which he had acquired not only an understanding of the audience for such material but also skill in its presentation. In his Preface, Dechales gives the reason for writing the <i>Cursus<i>: He wanted to produce a work for young students that would be used for self-study, that did not presume a previous knowledge of mathematics, and from which they could learn without the need for a teacher or guide. Dechales' purpose informs the content, style, and order of the work. Most of what he considered necessary in mathematics is presented in the first 400 pages of Tome I. In the rest of the work, geometry and the laws of proportions are used most often, along with a little trigonometry. The presentations are clear, sufficiently detailed, and often accompanied by figures which, though relatively simple wood-cuts, are important to the material. No derivations are given, only statements of results or facts, and though advancing no novelties of his own, Deschales exercises considerable discernment, presenting what he held to be the best of the then-current theories and formulations of the topics covered. He presents (and defends), for example, Galileo‚Äôs theory of motion, but generally rejects Cartesianism.||The second, posthumous edition was overseen by Father Aim√© Varcin, who has been entrusted by Dechales' brother to bring the Cursus back into print. Among the papers in Dechales' estate was an incomplete draft of a history of mathematics. Varcin reworked this and it appears as the 108-page Tractatus Proemialis at the start of Volume 1 of the second edition. Apart from some small additions by Varcin, the second edition is essentially a reprinting of the first, using the same wood blocks for the figures.||That the work was entirely self-contained and gave presentations of great clarity helped make it popular and widely used. It was, for example, still used as a textbook at the University of Upsala early in the 18th century.||Dechales' <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> was reviewed--in the form of a summary--in the Transactions of the Royal Society in Vol 9, No 110, Jan 1675, pp 229-233. Editions appeared 1674 and posthumously, slightly expanded to 4 volumes, in 1690.
","A complete course of Mixed Mathematics expressly meant for self-study and as an aid to teaching. It covers practical geometry, arithmetic, plane and spherical trigonometry, mechanics, statics, geography, magnetism, military architecture, hydrostatics and fountains, optics, music, pyrotechnics, astrolabes, dialling, astronomy, calendars, algebra, method of indivisibles, and conic sections.||Optics takes up 385 pages of volume 2, presenting Tracts 18-21 covering Optics, Perspective, Catoptrics, Dioptrics, and lastly a Mechanical Digression. The Optics tract is in three books: Suppositions and Vision; Binocular vision; Propagation of Light. The Perspective tract is in six books: Fundamentals; Iconographic projection; Sceneographics; Aspects of linear perspective. The Catoptrics tract is in four books: Plane mirrors; Convex mirrors; Concave mirrors; Cylindrical mirrors. The Dioptrics tract is in two books: Refraction and individual lenses; Combined lenses. The Mechanical Digression covers image locations, refracted colors, and aspects of meteorological phenomena.||The material includes: The eye's structure and function, monocular and binocular vision; the nature, propagation, reflection, and refraction of light; plain and curved mirrors and the images they produce, lenses and multiple lenses and the magnified images they produce; the operation of microscopes and telescopes. Dechales deals only briefly with physical optics, giving reasons for reflection and refraction, and most often in very short sections titled 'Digressio Physica.'  Most of the material is geometric optics and the fundamental quantity is the luminous ray. Dechales gives a competent overview of geometrical optics and images but never presents anything as densely mathematical as Barrow's Optical Lectures. However circumscribed by the intended purpose and audience, Dechales' presentations are remarkably clear, and along the way he introduces the term 'virtual image' as companion to 'real image' and so clarifies the physical meaning of image, uses pencils of rays to qualitatively analyze the position and size of images in lensed optical systems, and accurately describes the operation of the magic lantern.||Though dependent on many sources for his material, Dechales rarely cites them. Dechales' optical material includes some that comes from uncited works by Christoph Scheiner, Bonaventura Cavalieri, Gilles Personne de Roberval, James Gregory, and Francesco Eschinardi.","Images: Real and Virtual, Projected and Perceived, from Kepler to Dechales|Shapiro, A.E.|In: <i>Inside the Camera Obscura ‚Äì Optics and Art under the Spell of the Projected Image<i>|Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Preprint 333, 2007, pp 75-95.||<i>A Philosophical and Mathematical Dictiionary<i>|Hutton, C.|London, 1815, Vol I, pp 395-396.","R.P.

Christian Huygens,"Huygens, Christian",,1629-1695," ",Traite De La Lvmiere,"Huygens proposes a theory that light is a wave or pulse in an all-pervading aether and mode of propagation now known as Huygens's Principle. The propagation and interference of waves is used to explain the rectilinear propagation of light, its reflection, refraction, and diffraction.
","The origins of the <i>Trait√© De La Lumiere<i> were, in part, Huygens' treatise on dioptrics he had worked on since the early 1650s, the appearance of Newton's paper on the nature of light in 1672, and Ole R√∏mer's demonstration of light's finite speed in 1676.  With  R√∏mer's announcement, the nature of light came to the fore of scientific debate and theorizing in Europe. Huygens renewed his work on a wave theory of light after R√∏mer's announcement and, apparently while attempting to explain the caustics that refraction can generate, came upon the idea of wavelets and how they form new wave fronts--the basis for his theory of light. As a type of experimentum crucis, Huygens found that this theory could explain double refraction, a perplexing phenomenon exhibited by Icelandic spar and announced by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. Critical to Huygens developments was the finite speed of light: ordinary refraction was caused by waves traveling at different speeds in two media, and double refraction in Icelandic spar by differing speeds that depend on the orientation to the crystal axis. As he makes clear, light travels in waves because it travels with a finite speed.||Huygens presented his theory in a series of lectures to the French academy in 1679. Always slow to publish (if ever), Huygens finally saw his theory through the press eleven years later as the <i>Trait√© De La Lumiere<i>. Huygens had criticized Newton for not having had a physical or mechanical underpinning for his theory and so Huygens aim was to give a mathematical-physical explanation of the classical properties of light, based on a mechanism by which waves propagated through a corpuscular, all-pervading aether. The rays of geometrical optics were the perpendiculars to wave fronts, and on this basis most optical phenomena could be explained, including spherical aberration. Huygens acknowledged the work of Ignace Gaston Pardies and Robert Hooke regarding waves but believed that his explanation of double refraction demonstrated the economy, correctness, and explanatory power of this idea. At the same time, however, he acknowledged that he could not explain colors, diffraction, or the phenomenon of polarization.||The <i>Trait√© De La Lumiere<i> fell into obscurity not long after it appeared. After the initial positive reactions of Philippe de la Hire, Denis Papin, and Gottfried Leibniz, and the negative ones of Robert Hooke, Isaac Newton, Edmond Halley, and Johann Bernoulli, the Trait√© De La Lumiere was ignored and then forgotten. It was reviewed in the Acta Eruditorum in 1690 and in the Journal des S√ßavans in 1691. In the later case, the anonymous review clearly did not understand what he read. Generally, the <i>Trait√© De La Lumiere<i> came to be ignored because double refraction came to be ignored. With the rise of Newtonian optics, Huygens work was completely eclipsed. Interest in double refraction, and therefore in the <i>Trait√© De La Lumiere<i> arose again only with the work on crystals and double refraction of Ren√© Ha√ºy of 1788, William Wollaston of 1802, and √âtienne-Louis Malus of 1808, confirming Huygens results for double refraction. Huygens' Principle of wavefronts would be applied to profound effect by Augustin Fresnel in 1814.||This is likely the first issue; the title page contains only Huygens' initials. The second issue presents Huygens' full name.
","The <i>Traite De La Lumiere<i> is in six chapters. Chapter 1: On Rays Propagated  in Straight Lines. Chapter 2: On Reflection. Chapter 3: On Refraction. Chapter 4: On Refraction of the Air. Chapter 5: On the Strange Refraction of Iceland Crystal. Chapter 6: On the Figures of Transparent Bodies Which Serve for Refraction and Reflection.||Chapter 1 reviews the classic phenomena of optics and how their nature and properties comprise required outcomes for any theory of light. These include rectilinear propagation of rays, equal angle reflection, and the sine law of refraction. The chapter then sets out Huygens' theory of wave propagation: A wave front produces wavelets with all but motion locally perpendicular to the original wave cancel, the cumulative effect leaves a new, advancing wave front. Spherical wave fronts generated in this way radiate from each point on a luminous surface. Rays of light are taken as the perpendiculars to wave fronts. Chapter 2 applies this principle to explain the equal angle law of specular reflection. By invoking the finite speed of light wave travel, the perpendiculars to the series of reflected wave fronts (reflected rays) are are show to make angles with the surface perpendicular that are equal to those of the rays of the incoming waves. Chapter 3 applies the same analysis, based on finite light wave speed to explain the sine law of refraction. Wave front speed is slower in denser media; the denser, the slower. Wave fronts travel more slowly once in the denser medium and a geometric construction shows their perpendiculars (the refracted rays) form an angle with the refracting surface perpendicular whose sine in ratio to that of incident rays is the ratio of the media densities. That is, the sine law of refraction. Chapter 4 applies wave front refraction to atmospheric refraction, showing how it produces curved rays. Chapter 5 explains the double refraction observed in Icelandic spar. In this case, Huygens proposes that refracted waves propagate in two directions in the crystal.   The wavelets for waves propagating in the 'extraordinary' direction are not spherical but elliptical and the resulting non-spherical wave fronts have perpendiculars that are the extraordinary rays of double refraction. Chapter 6 uses wave front analysis to determine ideal figures for reflecting and refracting surfaces. It is here that the cause of spherical aberration is derived. Huygens was a practiced oculist and though he shows the theoretical benefits of elliptical and hyperbolic figures for lenses, he is aware that as a practical matter, they were essentially impossible to produce.||As Ernst Mach made clear, Huygens great advance was to show that the essential features of rectilinear propagation, reflection, and simple and double refraction could all be derived from simply the rate of propagation of light.","‚ÅÇ Kinematic Optics: A Study of the Wave Theory of Light in the Seventeenth Century|Shapiro, A.E.|<i>Archive for History of Exact Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 2/3, 1973, pp 134-266, NB pp 207-252.||Christiaan Huygens and the foundations of optics|Kubbinga, H.|Pure and <i>Applied Optics<i>, Vol 4, 1995, pp 723-739.||Huygens' 'Trait√© de la Lumi√®re' and Newton's 'Opticks': Pursuing and Eschewing Hypotheses|Shapiro, A.E.|<i>Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 43, No 2, 1989, pp 223-247.||ùëª <i>Huygens, Treatise on light.

","Beier's book describes the manufacture, uniformity and sale of instruments of all types, and gives the most important manufacturers of various kinds the instruments. One of the purposes of the work is to provide the proper legal terms and definitions to instruments, instrument makers, and anything relating to them. It deals with all types of scientific instruments for craftsmen, tradesmen, manufacturers, professionals, the military, and the navy. Articles deal with everything from musical instruments made of metal (brass & tin), medical instruments, instruments for dental work, barbers, apothecaries, engraving instruments, instruments for writing, bookbinders tools, libraries, tools for making various moving parts, agriculture, metal working, and screw making, Often particular manufacturers are mentioned along with the instruments that they specialized in. In the section on optical instruments he provides an appendix consisting of detailed descriptions of 13 different types of telescopes, microscopes, eyeglasses and other optical instruments with details on the range of power for each of different instruments along with the related price range one would expect to pay. Beier appears to have taken his information from a price list of instruments made by Johann Franz Griendl von Ach, author of the pioneering work on microscopy, Micrographia Nova of 1687.  Griendl von Ach was also an important manufacturer of optical devices in Nuremberg for 70 years of the 17th century and so the information regarding his instruments would have been easily accessible to Beier.

Jacques Ozanam,"Ozanam, Jacques",,1640-1718," ",Dictionnaire Mathematique,"A collection of long, descriptive essays containing definitions of terms and solved problems in a wide range of subjects in Mixed Mathematics. The section 'Optica,' though elementary, is detailed and elaborately geometric.
","Ozanam declares in his Preface his reason for writing the dictionary: Mathematics and the sciences had advance to such an extent, and their application to many aspects of commercial, intellectual, and military life was so extensive, that a general dictionary of terms and concepts was necessary. He makes it clear that the work is the compilation of a dictionary of the term of Mixed Mathematics. It contained definitions from algebra and geometry in addition to general notions of the disciplines which are founded on mathematics, such as naval architecture and music. It ends with an index which allows for the dictionary to be used for consultation, placing it in the tradition of scientific dictionaries. Ozanam's dictionary was acknowledged by Harris in his <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> of 1704. Editions appear at Paris and Amsterdam in 1691, and an English translation and abridgement by Joseph Raphson appeared at London in 1702.
","The <i>Dictionnaire Mathematique<i> is a collection of long, descriptive essays containing definitions of terms and solved problems in a wide range of subjects in Mixed Mathematics. The section 'Optica' (50 pages) includes: optics, perspective, gnomics, reflection, and refraction. The treatment, though elementary, is detailed and elaborately geometric. Each section begins with terms and their definitions, followed by exemplifying problems.

Pierre-Silvain R√©gis,"R√©gis, Pierre-Silvain",,1632-1707," ",Cours Entier de Philosophie,"A complete course in Cartesian philosophy, including logic, morals, metaphysics, and physics.","R√©gis studied under Rohault at the Sorbonne and became an ardent admirer and partisan expositor of the philosophy of Descartes. Sent by Rohault to spread the doctrine, R√©gis taught the principles of Cartesianism at Toulouse (1665), Aigues-Mortes, Montpellier (1671), and in Nicolas Lemery's laboratory in Paris (1680). Though recognized as the leading Cartesian Philosopher, R√©gis's late success came at a time when ecclesiastical defense of Aristotelian teaching produced powerful opponents to Cartesianism. The Archbishop of Paris condemned Cartesianism in 1671 and finally, in 1680, R√©gis was forced to suspend his lecturing. His years of teaching had made clear how Cartesian ideas should be expressed and his own orientation brought more empiricism to the Cartesian body of thought. All of this appeared in the <i>Cours<i>, but it would not be until 1690 when the work was allowed to appear in Paris. Even with permission to print, the Paris edition of 1690 could not have Descartes's name on the title page. The Dutch edition of the work, revised and printed in Amsterdam 1691, does carry Descartes's name.||Ostensibly Cartesian, R√©gis work shows the influence of the thought of Pierre Gassendi and Rohault‚Äôs extensive attempt to empiricize Catesianism. Other parts of it are, as a contemporary of R√©gis noted, amalgams of treatises of various sources: percussion by Edme Mariotte, chemistry by Nicolas Lemery, medicine by Raymond Vieussens and Guichard Joseph  du Verney, meteorics by Guillaume Lamy, and Hygrometers by Simon Foucher.||After Rohault‚Äôs <i>Treatise<i> of 1671, R√©gis's <i>Cours<i> was the most important popularizer of Descartes's ideas. Though titled so as to contain Logic, Metaphysics, Physics, and Morals, more than half of the work is devoted to Cartesian Physics.","Tome Premier begins with the <i>Discours sur la Philosophie<i>, a brief history of philosophy leading up to Descartes. This is followed by sections containing 4 parts on  Logic, 3 books in 5 parts on Metaphysics, and the first 2 books in 3 parts on Physics. The volume ends with a dictionary of philosophical terms. Tome Second contains 11 parts in book 3 through 7 on Physics. Tome Troisi√®me contains 4 parts of book 8 on Physics and 6 parts in 3 books on Ethics. The material on light and vision comprises 157 pages of book 8 in Tome Troisi√®me. The material is a selected recension of Descartes's <i>La Deioptrique<i>, augmented by Rohault. This includes: visual anatomy, sight and vision, the nature of light, light propagation, reflection, refraction, dioptrics and lenses, and correcting vision with lenses.","The Prince of Cartesian Philosophers: Pierre-Sylvain R√©gis'|del Prete, A.|In: The Oxford Handbook of Descartes and Cartesianism|Nadler, S., Schmaltz, T.M., Antoine-Mahut, D., editors|Oxford University Press, 2018.||'Pierre-Sylvain R√©gis: A Paradigm of Cartesian Methodology'|Clarke, D.M.|<i>Archiv f√ºr Geschichte der Philosophie<i>, Vol 62, No 3, 1980, pp 289-310.||<i>Descartes and the First Cartesians<i>|Ariew, R.|Oxford University Press, 2014, 236 pp, NB: pp 183-194.","Cours entier de philosophie, ou syst√®me g√©n√©ral selon les principes de M.

William Molyneux,"Molyneux, William",,1656-1698," ",Dioptrica Nova,"The first detailed presentation of dioptrics in English. The first of its two parts presents experiments, definitions, and 59 propositions, principally on geometric optics. The second part is a miscellany of practical and applied topics.
","The <i>Dioptrica Nova<i> is based on the notes Molyneux generated while studying optics with John Flamsteed who, in turn, had studied the optical papers of William Gascoigne left after his death. Molyneux wanted to write a book that encompassed he earlier work in astronomy and that demonstrated the utility of mathematics in optics--and do so in English, since most detailed and practical texts on optical instruments were in Latin. The book was written during 1689-1690 while Molyneux was in England. When he returned to Ireland 1691, Edmond Halley reviewed and correct the draft, added an appendix giving the first printing of his method for finding the focus of a spherical lens, and saw the work through the press.||The first part presents experiments, definitions, and propositions, principally on geometric optics, covering reflection, refraction, thin and thick lenses of convex and concave figure, the operation of the telescope, and the nature of vision corrected and uncorrected. Some of the proofs of the propositions are from Molyneux and are original, geometric and algebraic. Other are taken directly from Flamsteed. The second part is a miscellany of practical and applied topics. Importantly, this includes optical fabrication methods and their history and literature. The <i>Dioptrica Nova<i> was the best synthesis of dioptrics then available.||A copy of the book sent by Molyneux to John Locke was the beginning of a long friendship and correspondence. It was Locke who made famous 'Molyneux's Problem' concerning the consequences of immediate recovery from blindness. It was, perhaps, the publishing of 'Some Familiar Letters Between Mr. Locke, and Several of his Friends' in 1708 and in which Molyneux was so prominent, that interest arose again in the <i>Dioptrica Nova<i>, prompting a reprinting the following year.||In the Acta Eruditorum for January 1693, Leibniz gave a positive review of the book and Huygens studied the book carefully and was complimentary, writing that he thought it explained the telescope better than anyone had. The 'second edition' of 1708 is a reprinting of the 1692 text with a new title page.
","The <i>Diptrica Nova<i> is in two parts. The first (184 pages) presents experiments, definitions, and 59 propositions, principally on geometric optics, covering reflection, refraction, thin and thick lenses of convex and concave figure, the operation of the telescope, and the nature of vision corrected and uncorrected. Most of the proofs of the propositions are original, geometric and algebraic. The second part (110 pages) is a miscellany of practical and applied topics. Importantly, this includes optical fabrication methods and their history and literature.||In part one, one proposition is on vision (in which he muses on the inverted retinal image), two are on microscopes, and 56 are on the geometric optics of the telescope. These latter propositions come from Barrow, Leibniz, Halley, and Flamsteed. They are presented clearly and proven in often  tedious detail, but in the detail came clarity and conviction. The proofs are usually Molyneux's own, though he adds a few from John Flamsteed. The propositions involve plano-convex, double-convex, plano-concave, double-concave, and meniscus lenses. In addition, several conditions of multiple lens interaction are considered. For all these cases there are propositions for determining required surface radii given focal distance, focal distances given surface radii, and various combinations. But for all the detail, and unlike Kepler who considered bundles of rays, Molyneux's analysis of focal distance involved determining the place where an extreme ray crossed the optical axis of the lenses, limiting the applicability of the results.||Part two contains seven chapters. Chapter 1 considers refraction in general. Chapter 2: A lengthy descriptive of the four-lensed telescope and its non-inverted image. Chapter 3: Spectacles for indistinct vision. Chapter 4: A literature review and assessment for grinding and figuring lenses. Chapter 5: Telescopic instruments including telescopic sights, quadrants, sextants, and micrometers. It is here that Molyneux weights in on the controversy regarding dioptric instrument sights, rather than unaided sights. Chapter 6: A brief history of the telescope and microscope a review of the discoveries made with them; from Galileo to Hevelius, and from Hooke to Leeuwenhoek. Chapter 7: A consideration of the nature and operation of binocular vision. The Appendix presents the first printing of Edmond Halley's famous formula relating the conjugate foci of a thin spherical lenses to its focal length.","‚ÅÇ When an Eye is armed with a Telescope: The Dioptrics of William and Samuel Molyneux|Abrahams, P.|<i>Acta Historica Astronomiae<i>, Vol 33, pp 229-246.||<i>Lenses and Waves<i>|Dijksterhuis, F.J.|Kluwer, 2004, pp 41-47.||William Molyneux and the Optometry Content of his 1692 Book <i>Dioptrica Nova<i>|Goss, D.A.|Hindsight: <i>Journal of Optometry History<i>, Vol 39, No 2, 2008, pp 67-71.||William Molyneux and his <i>Dioptrica Nova<i>|Shepard, C.|<i>The American Journal of Physiological Optics<i>, Vol 3, No 1, 1922, pp 1-24.||Molyneux's Answer|Wade, N.J.|<i>Perception<i>, Vol 35, 3006, pp 1579-1582.||William Molyneux of Dublin, 1656-1698|Simms, J.G.|Dublin, Irish Academic Press, 1982, p 176.||<i>The Common Scientist of the Seventeenth Century: A Study of the Dublin Philosophical Society, 1683-1708<i>|Hoppen, K.T.|University of Virginia, 1970, Routledge, 2009, 298 p.","<i>Dioptrica Nova<i>.

Jean Picard,"Picard, Jean",,1620-1682,"Edited by Laurent Pothenot (1650-1732) French mathematician, French Academy of Sciences, and professor at the Coll√®ge de France.",Fragmens de dioptrique,"A collection of varied works by members of the French Academy of Sciences including Frenicle, Roberval, Huygens, Picard, Auzout, Mariotte, and R√∏mer. It includes an edited draft of a text on dioptrics from lectures given by Picard to the academy: the <i>Fragmens Dioptrique<i>, presenting 49 propositions and proofs on the geometrical optics of lenses.
","Between 1677 and 1679, Jean Picard presented a series of lectures on dioptrics to the French academy. In 1679 Pierre de Carcavi, mathematician and secretary of the National Library of France, proposed that Edm√© Mariotte, astronomer Philippe de La Hire and Picard produce a full treatise on optics for the Academy. Though the collaboration never took place, it was this project that apparent prompted Picard to begin a set of notes which he worked on until his death.||As the Preface makes clear, the volume collects works from several prominent authors in many areas, and in most cases is based on presentations made to the French Academy of Sciences. The editor was Philippe de la Hire, who had received several manuscripts from Jean Picard, who, in turn, had been entrusted with manuscripts of Bernard Fr√©nicle de Bessy, Christiaan Huygens, and Gilles Personne de Roberval for printing. Eventually, de la Hire would add the other works the volume contains, including works by Jean Picard. The Preface also states that at the time of Picard's death, Picard's collection of notes on dioptrics 'was in great confusion' and that the French mathematician and academician Laurent Pothenot oversaw their ordering and editing. This is likely the reason for their title: Les Fragmens de Dioptrique. Picard's extensive work with optical instruments in gnomics, astronomy, and surveying lead naturally to a keen interest in optics. The 77-page manuscript Pothernot worked on was a draft of Picard's text on dioptrics. It contained 49 propositions covering: refraction at spherical surfaces, focal characteristics of various types of lenses, and refraction at water, air, and glass interfaces. The text was based on presentations Picard had made to the French Academy in 1680.||Picard had carefully studies the optics of Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Barrow and wrote a summary of dioptrics expressly for applications to optical instruments.||This work on dioptrics by Picard would be printed again in 1730, pages 550-626 of volume 6, of the Memoires published by the French Academy that collected material from 1666 to its reorganization in 1699. It would appear again in 1736 in <i>Ouvrages de Mathematique de M. Picard<i>, a collection of astronomical and physical works of Picard.
","A collection of 31 treatises from 17th century French natural philosophers. All but one appearing here for the first time. Gilles Roberval (9), Frenicle de Besay (4), Christiaan Huygens (8), Jean Picard (5), Auzout (2), Mariotte (1) and Ole R√∏mer (2).||Jean Picard's <i>Fragmens de Dioptrique<i> comprise pages 375-412 of the volume. The text is a collection of propositions that deal with the essential aspects of the geometrical optical aspects of dioptrics. Propositions 1-3 cover the fundamentals of refraction as curved interfaces. Propositions 4-16 establish the basic properties of lenses, giving the relationship between figure, curvature, focal distance, and image position and size for many types of spherically-figured lenses, for rays that are parallel and oblique to the optical axis. It is here that Picard gives his expression for spherical aberration. Propositions 17-24 solve various problems that relate curvature radii and conjugate focal points for various types of lenses. Picard obtains essentially the same result as Edmond Halley regarding thin lenses. Propositions 25-35 consider similar problems, but with lenses fully or partially immersed in water.  Propositions 36-44 consider oculars and their interaction with objective lenses. Propositions 45-49 consider the effects of refracted rays that reflect off the interior surfaces of a lens, and how this effects lens use, particularly in surveying.||The 49 propositions are proved or demonstrated with detailed geometric analysis. They are often accompanied by corollaries that extend the utility of the proposition, and in some cases 'rules' are given that summarize characteristics or can be used to guide the construction of a lens. The material is entirely mathematical; though Picard was very much a practitioner, no practical aspects regarding lens making are presented.","Recherches sur les travaux de dioptrique et de catoptrique de Jean Picard √† l'acad√©mie royale des sciences|Blay, M.|In: <i>Jean Picard et les d√©buts de l'astronomie de pr√©cision au XVIIe si√®cle<i>|√âditions du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1987, pp 329-344.",Fragmens de dioptrique  In: Divers ouvrages de matheÃÅmatique et de physique par Messieurs de l'AcadeÃÅmie Royale des Sciences,Fragments on Dioptrics.

The material on Color is classical, with no influence of Descartes or Newton, and is considered a separate entity from light but like it, radiated from objects to be received by the eye. The last two chapters deal with vision and its function. Vision is defined to be motion of animal spirit to the brain from the retina, having been impressed by rays entering the eye from the viewed object.

Vision with two eyes is then described. Imperfect vision, myopia, and visual acuity are then discussed. Vision correction with convex and concave lenses as described by Descartes is discussed. Distant vision, presbyopia and its correction, and cataracts are described. Methods to improve vision are then described including vignetting, summarizing the views of Descartes and Rohault. Vision improvement is described and analyzed in terms of rays and simple geometric optics, ocular anatomy, vision being due to images formed on the retina. The more practical aspects of sight are also considered, including visual cues and why in which we process things in the visual field. He touches on how these cues and perspective are used in the theater. La Hire noted that certain color perceptions change in dim light.  In the second and shorter part of the treatise La Hire takes up and considers various options concerning the function of the eye and the nature of sight.","Les Publications de l'Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences de Paris (1666-1793): Tome I: Description bibliographique.

Nicolaas Hartsoeker,"Hartsoeker, Nicolaas",,1656-1725," ",Essay de Dioptrique (a),"A detailed treatise on lens making and their use in telescopes and microscopes, direct from hands-on experience.","Hartsoeker's <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> is his first publication and the culmination of 20 years of lens grinding and instrument making, including not only time as an independent craftsman but also his years working in the Paris observatory. It is also the first expression of his developing work in natural philosophy. Hartsoeker was living in Paris at the time he wrote <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> and had acquired a European reputation for lens-craft and instrument making. Unlike most other European lens makers, Hartsoeker made no secret of his craft and the <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> gives long, detailed descriptions of all aspects of lens making. Beyond the technical details of lens-craft, he includes his notions regarding the nature of light and the reasons for and processes of reflection and refraction, and his telescopic and microscopic observations and their interpretation. Given the range of material covered, the work's title is, perhaps, too diminutive.||Hartsoeker's treatment of technical details is thoroughly mathematical, written in the style of textbook, and his practical and mechanical descriptions are informed by his long and deep experience. His natural philosophy is significantly more speculative and, particularly when interpreting his own telescopic and microscopic observations, opened a door for considerable criticism. The interpretations he gave to some of his microscopical observations were influenced by 'animalculist' beliefs. It is in this regard that he makes his famous conjecture, provided with an accompanying and equally famous figure, that a tiny, preformed human resides in a spermatozoon.||A Dutch translation appeared at Amsterdam in 1699.
","The <i>Essay Dioptrique<i> contains 10 chapters. Chapter 1: nature and origin of light rays. Chapter 2: opaque and transparent bodies. Chapter 3: rectilinear light rays. Chapter 4: on reflection and refraction. Chapter 5: the radiant point. Chapter 6: the eye. Chapter 7: vision. Chapter 8: making glass lenses. Chapter 9: proper use of lenses. Chapter 10: observations made with telescopes and microscopes||Hartsoeker considers light a fiery liquid, one of the two substances that make up all matter. Opaque or transparent bodies are made up of the second substance; its particulate arrangement allowing, or not, the passage of light at a finite speed that depends on the body's density. Mechanical forces are invoked to explain reflection and refraction, and these same forces, varying with different rays, cause different colors as 'they strike the organ of vision.' Color are produced by the interaction of rays with materials, culling some rays, enhancing others; thus the color appearance of objects. The material on ocular anatomy is contemporary and that on vision is Keplerian.||The material on lens making is very detailed and includes: the proper chemical composition of glass; glass forming and its difficulties; glass types; grinding, figuring, polishing, and testing lenses.

That is clear from the content of these notes printed in 1695. Gregory had a utilitarian view of education and expressed such to Parliament's Visiting Committee: teaching Latin was a waste of time, philosophy should not consume three years, and mathematics should be compulsory. Regarding optics, he was teaching the function and use of optical machines in life, commerce and industry and in such an environment, Newtonian theories had no place. Besides, his Scottish students were too young to have had the necessary mathematics. Editions appeared in 1695 and 1713 and an English translation in 1715 and 1735.

Sturm was the thesis director and had and developed the   idea of the camera obscura as a model for the eye in his <i>Collegium Experimentale<i> of 1676. In the Preface to his thesis, Doppelmayr singles out the peripatetic teaching on the functioning of the eye, and cites the widely read Aristotelian commentary by Jacopo Zabarella which had appeared less than a decade earlier. Doppelmayr writes his thesis to both correct the mistaken but authoritative peripatetic teaching on eye-function, and to record his work on the camera obscura as a model of the eye. The theory and practice of the camera obscura are presented, both with small and large  apertures and with lenses. Works by Ren√© Descartes, Christoph Scheiner, and Jacques Rohault are cited. Like Johannes Zahn's <i>Oculis Artificialis<i> or Christoph Scheiner's <i>Oculus<i>, Doppelmayr's thesis is one of the earliest works on the camera obscura as a model of the eye, but unlike Zahn or Scheiner's works, its scarcity has had it overlooked in written histories of the camera obscura.
","Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr's thesis is in 12 chapters. 1: construction, operation, and use of the camera obscura; 2: how the eye is like a small camera obscura; 3: how the camera obscura generates an inverted images; 4: preparing a camera obscura to imitate the eye; 5: vision and the way simple objects are seen; 6: seeing light, color, shadow, and objects; 7: requisites and conditions for direct vision; 8: view of shapes; 9: view of site and distance; 10: view of size; 11: view of number; 12: view of motion.||Doppelmayr presents an analysis similar to that in Johannes Kepler's Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena of 1604 regarding images produced by pinhole and large apertures in a camera obscura. To this is added the functioning of a double convex lens placed in the aperture, showing how the image is brighter and more clear. This is carefully compared to the eye. Doppelmayr describes how an artificial eye can be constructed as a spherical camera obscura. The retinal image is the basis for Doppelmayr's analysis of the perception of color and objects. This includes showing how spectacles can correct near and short-sightedness. The material is not mathematical, but is detailed and complete.

Nicolaas Hartsoeker,"Hartsoeker, Nicolaas",,1656-1725,Edited by  A. Block,Proeve der deurzicht-kunde,"Ameldonck Block's Dutch translation of Nicolaas Hartsoeker's <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> of 1694. The last chapter include reports of Hartsoeker's extensive observations with a microscope of his own construction, including his famed description of spermatozoa.
","Hartsoeker's <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> is his first publication and the culmination of 20 years of lens grinding and instrument making, including not only time as an independent craftsman but also his years working in the Paris observatory. It is also the first expression of his developing work in natural philosophy. Hartsoeker was living in Paris at the time he wrote <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> and had acquired a European reputation for lens-craft and instrument making. Unlike most other European lens makers, Hartsoeker made no secret of his craft and the <i>Essay de Dioptrique<i> gives long, detailed descriptions of all aspects of lens making. Beyond the technical details of lens-craft, he includes his notions regarding the nature of light and the reasons for and processes of reflection and refraction, and his telescopic and microscopic observations and their interpretation. Given the range of material covered, the work's title is, perhaps, too diminutive.||Hartsoeker's treatment of technical details is thoroughly mathematical, written in the style of textbook, and his practical and mechanical descriptions are informed by his long and deep experience. His natural philosophy is significantly more speculative and, particularly when interpreting his own telescopic and microscopic observations, opened a door for considerable criticism. The interpretations he gave to some of his microscopical observations were influenced by 'animalculist' beliefs. It is in this regard that he makes his famous conjecture, provided with an accompanying and equally famous figure, that a tiny, preformed human resides in a spermatozoon.||This Dutch translation appeared at Amsterdam in 1699. The translator provided his own Preface and explains that Hartsoeker's book is so 'lucid, veracious, and judicious' that he translated it for those wishing to learn lens-craft who did not read Latin or French. The¬†cover illustration by Jan Luykens; an engraving by Jan Goeree shows Hartsoeker‚Äôs long telescope with a wooden tube, hoisted on a mast. To the left side is another tubeless telescope with the objective lens being hoisted onto the mast of the large wooden telescope.
","The <i>Essay Dioptrique<i> contains 10 chapters. Chapter 1: nature and origin of light rays. Chapter 2: opaque and transparent bodies. Chapter 3: rectilinear light rays. Chapter 4: on reflection and refraction. Chapter 5: the radiant point. Chapter 6: the eye. Chapter 7: vision. Chapter 8: making glass lenses. Chapter 9: proper use of lenses. Chapter 10: observations made with telescopes and microscopes||Hartsoeker considers light a fiery liquid, one of the two substances that make up all matter. Opaque or transparent bodies are made up of the second substance; its particulate arrangement allowing, or not, the passage of light at a finite speed that depends on the body's density. Mechanical forces are invoked to explain reflection and refraction, and these same forces, varying with different rays, cause different colors as 'they strike the organ of vision.' Color are produced by the interaction of rays with materials, culling some rays, enhancing others; thus the color appearance of objects. The material on ocular anatomy is contemporary and that on vision is Keplerian.||The material on lens making is very detailed and includes: the proper chemical composition of glass; glass forming and its difficulties; glass types; grinding, figuring, polishing, and testing lenses. Hartsoeker describes grinding lenses in metal forms, rather than turning on a lathe. The construction of spectacles, telescopes, and microscopes are also described in detail, including examples of the calculations necessary to determine lens radii, spacing, and size. The last chapter include reports of Hartsoeker's extensive observations with a microscope of his own construction, including his famed description of spermatozoa.","The Natural Philosopher and the Microscope: Nicolas Hartsoeker Unravels Nature's 'Admirable ≈íconomy'|Abou-Nemeh, S.C.|<i>History of Science<i>,Vol 51, No 1, 2013, pp 1-32.||Images and Ideas: Leeuwenhoek's Perception of the Spermatozoa|Ruestow, E.G.|<i>Journal of the History of Biology<i>, Vol 16, No 2, 1983, pp 185-224.||Constructive thinking: a case for dioptrics|Dijksterhuis, F.J.|In: <i>The Mindful Hand: Inquiry and Invention from the late Renaissance to Early Industrialization<i>|Koninkliijke, Amsterdam, 2007, 468 pp, pp 59-82.||<i>A Certain Instrument to See Far: Four Centuries of Styling the Telescope Illustrated by a Selection of Treasures from the Louwman Collection of Historic Telescopes<i>|Louwman, P.J.K., Zuidervaart, H.J.|Wassenaar, 2013, 256 p.","Proeve der deurzicht-kunde, in het Frans beschreeven van de Heer Nicolaas Hartsoeker, en vertaald door A.

","Christoph Sturm had a keen interest in the rainbow, among other optical phenomena, so it was natural that one of his students should study the subject in detail. As was the custom at the time, the thesis was actually written by Sturm and defended by his student. The work is interesting in that it gives clear insight into what was known and had generally been read about the rainbow at the end of the 17th century. Sturm's student and thesis respondent, Christoph Gottlieb, was a member of the ancient Patrician  N√ºrnburg family of Volckammer von Kirchensittenbach.

","The thesis, under the direction of Christoph Sturm, by Christoph Gottlieb  'Volckammer von Kirchensittenbach', surveys all that was known about the rainbow. In two parts: the first considers the history, appearance, characteristics, and theories of the rainbow's appearance. The explanations, spanning all the rainbow's recorded history, of Aristotle, Maurolyco, Witelo, DuHamel, Fabri, and Descartes are presented. Though the geometric optics of Descartes' rainbow is acknowledged as ingenious, its explanation for rainbow color is rejected. Mariotte is preferred.  The second part considers the generation of the rainbow's colors and size, examining in detail the work of Mariotte, Descartes, Eckard, and Fabri. These latter sections present considerable calculational detail. The work of Newton, Deschales, and Grimaldi is mentioned in passing. Generally, the material is collected uncritically but described carefully. The plates of figures are detailed and are essential to the explanations given, particular the contemporary ones.

","A brief text on the measurement of light, arising in part, from the need to be able to produce reliable ratios of different amounts of light. At the start of the 18th century there were instruments that made it possible to determine such ratios of temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure; but not for light. Jean Fran√ßois-Marie describes a simple way to make such a determination, using attenuation to extinction.

","In his 'From the Author to the Reader', Jean Fran√ßois-Marie describes in the utility and importance of the thermometer, barometer, and the hygrometer for measuring temperature, pressure, and humidity. He finds the lack of a similar instrument for the measurement of light a serious lacuna and proposes a <i>Lucimetre<i> for the measurement of light. The instrument is an opaque tube through which a source is viewed. Multiple glass plates are placed in the tube until the source cannot be seen. The number of plates is inversely proportional to the 'degree of light.'

Book One is devoted to the senses, including vision and optics. Later editions included the long 'Eclairissment' on light, color, and vision.
","See Entry 163.  In 1699 Malebranche communicated to the Academy his memoire 'R√©lxions sur la lumi√®re et couleurs' and this would become an additional, unnumbered Elucidation, 'On Light and Colors, the Generation of Fire', that first appeared in this edition of 1700.<i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i> first appeared at Paris in 1674 and 1675.

","Seen Entry 163. In the new, unnumbered Elucidation on light and colors, Malebranche sets out his theory of optics, particularly the origin of colors. Color, he maintains, is produced by the different rates of vibration of the subtle matter set up by the luminous object and received by the eye. Variations in brightness are caused by the strength (not the rate) of the vibrations. Importantly, Malebranche considers white as a kind of color, caused by the highest rates of vibration. Malebranche is concerned with the nature of things and thus, is attracted to questions on the nature of light, color, and vision, but not, for example, on anything related to geometric optics.",See Entry 163.,"De la Recherche de la Verit√©.

"Nicholas Malebranche, CO","Malebranche, Nicholas CO",,1638-1715,Translated by Thomas Taylor (1669-1735) English philosopher at Oxford.,Father Malebranche's Treatise,"Second edition of the English translation of the 3rd edition of the <i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i> of 1678, which included the Elucidations. The Elucidation on light and color presents a theory based on the transmission of pressure or 'tendency toward motion': Light is pressure transmitted through the plenum and color a result of the changing rate of vibrations.
","By the time Thomas Taylor was working on the second edition of his translation of the third edition of Malebranche's <i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i>, Malebranche's ideas concerning light and color had under gone considerable development. In 1687 his writing reflected an idea he had introduced into Descartes' concept of light being a percussively transmitted pressure in the plenum: the pressure or 'tendency to motion' was not static but consisted of periodic variations, which he called 'pressure vibrations.' In 1699 Malebranche was elected an honorary academician of the French Academy of Science to which he read his memoire 'Reflection Light and Colors and the Generation of Fire.' By the time of this memoire he had significantly modified Descartes' ideas of regarding the nature of light in part because of Romer's discovery of light's finite travel speed Huygens ideas concerning wave propagation. Malebranche developed his idea of pressure vibrations to explain color: vibrations of different 'promptitude' (what would now be described as frequency) produced different colors, and different amplitudes produced different intensities. But however changed from Descartes' original ideas, it was fundamentally a mechanical philosophy.||This memoire would eventually become the 16th Elucidation Malebranche added to the 1700 edition of <i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i>. Before it appeared, a manuscript of it was obtained by Taylor who included its translation at the end this edition of his translation of De la Recherche de la Verit√©. Though Malebranche would later complain about its infidelity, Taylor's translation of the memoire was the mechanism by which Malebranche's ideas on light and color were known in England. Taylor's translation and Malebranche's new edition, both of 1700, would bring into print the first theory of light and color based on amplitude and frequency of vibrations.||The final version of Malebranche‚Äôs ideas on light and color--informed by his reading of Newton's Optice of 1706--appeared in the 1712 edition of the <i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i>.
","The second edition of the English translation of <i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i> of 1678, includes what Taylor named a 'Short Discourse on Light and Colours' which is a translation of Malebranche's memoire on that subject read to the French Academy in 1699, giving his theory of light as percussive vibrations, traveling with a finite speed, with 'promptitude' that determined its color and amplitude that determined its intensity. The percussive vibrations were transmitted among vanishingly-small vortices. Malebranche theorizes that it is the changing pressure, the pressure vibrations, to which the retina of the eye is sensitive. A constant pressure, he argues by way of analogy, is not sensed in the same way that we are unaware of the constant air pressure that surrounds us. Similarly, as small and large amplitude determine light's intensity, if a body diminishes the incident amplitude--that is, it weakly reflects--then the reflected light has reduced intensity. Similarly, Malebranche proposes that if a body changes the 'promptitude' of percussive vibrations then the light it reflects will have a color changed from that of the incident light. If the reflected body is specular, then the reflected angle equals the incident angle, as would be expected ballistically. The basic properties of light--the amplitude and 'promptitude' of its percussive vibrations--are explained by the forces acting on vanishingly-small vortices and the forces they themselves produce. These force interactions are invoked to explain the sine law of refraction.",See Entry 163.,"Father Malebranche his Treatise concerning the search after truth. The whole work complete.

","One of many dissertations under the direction of Harald Vallerius, musician and mathematician at the University of Upsala. His son is the defendant of the thesis. The thesis makes clear several aspects of optics as studied at the end of the 17th century: Cartesian notions of light prevailed, there was general acceptance of Kepler's  analog of the camera obscura for the eye, the camera obscura was widely used for art and drawing, and the actual functioning of the magic lantern was generally not well understood.","The dissertation is in four short chapters. 1: The nature of light; 2: Natural Camerae Obscurae, the Eye; 3: Artificial Camerae Obscurae; 4: 'Megalographia' or the inverse of the Camera Obscura. Chapter one is a review of the the theories of the conception of the nature of light and its propagation. Descartes, Rohault, and Dechales are cited. The cartesian conception is used to explain reflection and refraction. Chapter two presents the Keplerian and Cartesian analysis of the eye as a camera obscura. Chapter three presents typical camerae obscurae, including simple pin-hole instruments and those fitted with a convex lens. Descartes, Kepler, Scheiner, Kircher, Schott, Deschales, and Hevelius are cited. Chapter four presents the 'inversion' of the camera obscura. That is, instead of bring an image in, an image is projected out. This is the magic lantern, the 'Mealographia' of the title. The presentation is very brief and passes over the actual geometric optics of the magic lantern, citing Kircher and presenting a very simplified and flawed image of the workings of a magic lantern.","Introducing the Instrument|Lefevre, W., Wenczel, N., and Gorman, M.J.|In: <i>Inside the Camera Obscura ‚Äì Optics and Art under the Spell of the Projected Image<i>|Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, preprint 333, 2007, pp 1-31.","Dissertatio physico-mathematica de camera obscura, quam Permissu Ampl: Coll: Philsoph: Upsaliensis, moderatore patre carissimo Mag.

The brief section on catoptrics describes the action of plan and spherical mirrors, showing virtual image position and how minification and magnification result. Color is described as resulting from different species of rays impinging on the retina and provoking different responses.

Euclid,Euclid,Euclid of Alexandria,c295 BC,Translated by David Gregory (1661 - 1708) Scottish mathematician. Taught at University of Edinburgh and Oxford. Promoter of Newtonian ideas in the university curriculum.,Euclidis qu√¶ supersunt omnia,"First collected edition of Euclid's works, in Greek and Latin, including the Optica and the Catoptrica. This was the standard, pre-nineteenth-century source for the Greek text of Euclid.","The Scottish mathematician David Gregory's Euclid published at Oxford in 1703 is from Commandine's Latin edition and makes use of Bernard's corrections and contains all the then-known works of Euclid.  It is the first collected edition, in Greek and Latin, including the Optica and the Catoptrica.  Gregory states that he followed Commandine in the main, but corrected numerous passages by means of books in the Bodleian Library that had belonged to Edward Bernard, the former Savilian Professor of Astronomy, who had started but not finished a plan to publish Euclid's complete works. Though Gregory also mentions that he consulted many Greek manuscripts, the Greek text is essentially that edited by Simon Grynaeus and published by Johannes Herwagen at Basel in 1533. For the Greek text, Gregory has the help of the Bodley's Librarian, John Hudson. Hudson annotated the Basel text, calling out passages that differed importantly from the Latin. It is these for which Gregory then consulted Greek manuscripts to attempt to determine the correct text.||Gregory's text would remain the only edition of Euclid's complete works until the edition of J.L. Heiberg and H. Menge, published at Leipzig in 1883. The frontispiece illustrates a story that Vitruvius relates in Book VI of <i>De Anchitectura<i>. The shipwrecked Socratic philosopher Aristippus and his companions make it safely to the shore of Rhodes--land unknown to them. When he saw geometric figures drawn in the sand, Aristippus exclaimed 'Let us be of good hope, for I see the traces of men.'
","This was the standard, pre-nineteenth-century source for the Greek text of Euclid. It was the first edition of the Greek-Latin parallel text, including the texts of Euclid's small writings. The contents includes: Elementorum libri XV, Data, Introductio harmonica, Sectio canonis, Phenomena, Optica, Catoptrica, De divisionibus liber, De levi et ponderoso fragmentum. Latin translations of Euclid's <i>Optica<i> and <i>Catoptrica<i> were first printed in Georgius Valla's massive compendium <i>De Expetendis et Fugiendis Rebus Opus<i> printed by Aldus at Venice in 1501, but they both first appeared together in the first Latin edition of Euclid's collected works in 1537. The <i>Optica<i> is a Latin translation of the first Greek work on vision and perspective--the earliest surviving text on optics and light in the western world. The <i>Optica<i> presents the phenomena of visible light and the Euclidian idea of vision rays emanating from the eye, comfortably aligned with and analyzed by geometry. It re-emerged as an important text in the 15h century for it use in the theory of linear perspective. The <i>Catoptrica<i>, a treatise on mirrors attributed by Proclus to Euclid, covers the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed by plane and spherical concave mirrors.","Early editions of Euclid in England|Simpkins, D.M.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 22, No 4, 1966, pp 225-249.||The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements, Translated from the Text of Heiberg|Cambridge, Vol 1, 1908, NB: pp 100-103.","Eukleidou ta zozomena - Euclidis quae supersunt omnia.

Christian Huygens,"Huygens, Christian",,1629-1695,"Edited by Burchard de Volder, Bernard Fullenius",Opuscula postuma,"A printing of edited manuscripts left by Huygens after his death including, most importantly, the Dioptrica. The collection also includes Huygens' commentaries on figuring and polishing lenses, a dissertation on coronae and parahelia, tracts on motion and centrifugal force, and a description of Huygens' planetarium or orrery.","When Christiaan Huygens died in 1695, he bequeathed to the University of Leiden his workbooks, papers, and letters. In his will he requested that Bernard Fullenius Jr (friend and government official) and Burchard de Volder (famed natural philosopher at the University of Leiden) prepare for publication the manuscripts of his Dioptrics, his Laws of Percussion, his Dutch treatise on lenses, and anything else that they felt worth printing. Fullenius and de Volder acted as editors and produced the <i>Opuscula Postuma<i> of 1703. The editors invoked the help of 'curators and councilors' whom they list before their own Preface.||Unlike the other the material, the manuscript for the <i>Dioptrica<i> was in a state ready for publishing at the time of Huygens' death. He had worked on it nearly constantly for more than 30 years; always promising to publish but never doing so. He had carefully ordered and numbered the pages, had them copied, and personally corrected the copy. There was little for the editors to do but see the manuscript through the press.||Unlike the Trait√© de la Lumi√®re, his later work which was narrowly concerned with the nature and propagation of light, the <i>Dioptrica<i> dealt only with mathematical geometrical optics, practical lens craft, and optical instruments. The first part of the <i>Dioptrica<i> dates from around 1652 and contains Huygens earliest work on refraction and lenses. The second part which deals with spherical aberration dates from around 1665. This section was considerably revised when Huygens read of Newton's discovery of chromatic dispersion in 1672. The third part on telescopes and microscopes was written 1685.||The influence of the <i>Opuscula Postuma<i> was limited, since many of the most striking advances that Huygens had made and recorded in the <i>Dioptrica<i> had subsequently been made by others and published earlier. This was the case with both Isaac Barrow in his <i>Lectiones Optic√¶<i> of 1674 and William Molyneux in his <i>Dioptrica Nova<i> of 1692. However superseded its content may have been  by the time it was published, the <i>Dioptrica<i> revealed the workings of one of the 17th century's most singular talent in optics. Interestingly, the anonymous editor of Isaac Newton's <i>Optical Lectures<i> of 1729 claimed that the appearance of Huygens's <i>Dioptrica<i> in the <i>Opuscula Postuma<i> in 1703 was one of the factors that overcame Newton's famed refractory reluctance to publish his Opticks--which finally appeared in 1704. A second edition of the <i>Opus Postuma<i> appeared in 1728.
","Huygens' <i>Dioptrica<i> is in three parts. The first is a tract on refraction and the telescope, the Tractatus de Refractione et Telescopiis; the second is on spherical aberration, the De Aberratione Radiorum a Foco; and the third on practical telescopes and microscopes, the De Telescopiis et Microscopiis. The <i>Dioptrica<i> contains much original work. In the first part Huygens uses the sine law of refraction to establish fundamental characteristics of lens imaging for paraxial rays. In the same part, and more importantly, he derives his theorem on the unchanged image formed by a system of lenses when the eye and object are interchanged. This theorem was a great analytic power and would later be (re)discovered by Smith and presented in his <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738.||In the second part, Huygens presents his theorem and practical embodiment of a lens doublet which overcomes spherical aberration using only spherical figures. In the third part, telescope magnification is shown to be the ratio of object-to-ocular focal lengths. This section also contains considerable material on physiological optics, the efficacious functioning of telescopes and microscopes, and describes a 'simplified eye': the eye modeled with concentric hemispheres of different radii. The Dioptrica and Huygens work on meteorological optics of coronas and halos take 370 of the collection's 430 pages.","Some of Huygens‚Äô Contributions to Dioptrics, with Notes|Southall, J.P.C.|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i>, Vol 6, No 5, 1922, pp. 461-475.||<i>Lenses and Waves<i>|Dijksterhuis, F.J.|Kluwer, 2004, pp 213-253.||Christiaan Huygens' great treasure|Yoder, J.G.|<i>Tractrix<i>, 3, 1991, pp 1-13.||Huygens's Dioptrica|Jan Dijksterhuis, F.J.|<i>De zeventiende eeuw<i>, Vol 12, No 1, 1996, pp 117-127.||<i>Christiaan Huygens, Oeuvres compl√®tes.

Anonymous,Anonymous,,," ",Opticks,"A review of Newton's <i>Opticks<i> of 1704. A summary of the content, with slight commentary, rather than a technical review.
","This notice of the publication of Isaac Newton's <i>Opticks<i> appeared in The History of the Works of the Learned, a weekly journal summarizing books, papers, and reports and which, as its title page states, was 'An Impartial Account of Books Lately Printed in all Parts of Europe. With a Particular Relation of the State of Learning in each Country.' It was published in London from 1699 until 1711, after which it appeared biannually until 1743. The notice reflects the high standing Newton had with the anonymous editor--and virtually all of England at the time. The appearance of the notice following so immediately after the publication of the Opticks speaks not only of knowledge circulating within London's printing community, but also of the general anticipation of a major work by Newton. This was the first review or notice of Newton's <i>Opticks<i>. The author is unknown. Leibniz would review the Opticks--much more thoroughly and with considerably less credulity--in the Acta Eruditorum of February 1706.
","The notice for the <i>Opticks<i> appeared in <i>The History of the Works of the Learned<i> for the month of April 1704 on pages 225-231. It begins with fulsome praise of Newton himself and the general excellence of the book. There follows a detailed summary of the principal components of Book I of the Opticks. Particular emphasis is placed on the claims Newton made about the chromatic heterogeneity of white light and the prismatic experiments supporting them. The notice summarizes and praises, but, not surprisingly for a general magazine, does no analysis and certainly presents no criticism. Only Book I of the <i>Opticks<i> is reviewed. The notice ends with 'An Account of the 2nd and 3rd Books the Reader may expect some other Time.' A notice of these books of the <i>Opticks<i> never appeared. No mention is made of the highly technical and mathematical tracts dealing with fluxions that Newton appended to the Opticks of 1704.

Rene Descartes,"Descartes, Rene",,1596-1650," ",Opuscula posthuma,"Second edition of the Latin rendering of the optics text Le Monde of 1664 and other smaller work previously unpublished.
","The <i>Opuscula Pothuma<i> has its origins in the unpublished manuscripts left Descartes' death. A few would appear in the original French, sometimes added to other works, sometimes published alone. The most notable was La Monde which first appeared in 1664, with a second edition in 1677. These works remained unpublished even though they came into the hands of various editors, including Claude Clerselier, Walther von Tschirnhaus, Johannes de Raei, and and Gottfried Leibniz. These were all eventually translated into Latin by an unrecorded translator and included: <i>Mundus, sive Disseratio de Lumine; Rebulae ad directionem ingenii; Inquisitiio Veritatis per Lumen Naturale; Primae Cognitationes circa Generationaem Animalium; Nonnulla de Saporibus<i>; and <i>Excerpta ex Mss. R. Des-Cartes.<i> These were collected first in the <i>Opuscula Posthuma<i> that appeared at Amsterdam in 1701. The edition of 1704 is a line-for-line reprint of the 1701 text. The 1704 printer's mark is an imitation and the paper shows the water mark of Italian manufacture. Thus, the 1704 edition was likely printed in Rome.","<i>Mundus<i> is the close Latin translation of <i>Le Monde<i>, Descartes' early treatise on Light, containing 15 chapters. The first five set out Descartes view of the mechanical basis for all of natural philosophy. In these, he refutes Scholastic teachings regarding the nature of sense perceptions in general and those from light in particular. It is here he introduces his mechanical theory of the nature of light and mechanisms of sense perception. Descartes then presents a mechanistic view of fluids and air and in chapter 5 explains how fire, air, and earth are involved in the generation, propagation, and reflection and refraction of light: generation by fire, propagation by pressure in fluids, and reflection and refraction by terrestrial objects.||Chapters 6 and 7 present Descartes three laws of motion and inertia: conservation of states of bodies (size, motion, rest, position), conservation of the 'force of motion' of bodies, and the constancy of rectilinear direction of motion. Chapters 8-12 use the theory of matter developed in chapters 1-5 and the laws of motion and inertia in 6 and 7 to develop a Copernican cosmography based on vortices, fluids, and mechanical interaction. Chapters 13-15 deal with physical optics and, using his theory of matter and laws of motion, and the properties of the 'tendency to motion' of closely-packed particles, explain light's rectilinear propagation, specular reflection, and refraction.||As with his later writings, Descartes' presentation is based more on analogy than on analysis, particularly regarding the nature of light and it propagation.","<i>A Bibliography of the Works of Descartes I & II<i>|van Otegem, M.|Quaestiiones Infinitae, Vol 37|Publications of the Leiden-Utrecht Research Institute of Philosophy, Utrecht, 2002, NB: pp 657-678.","Opuscula posthuma, physica et mathematica",Ren√© Descartes.

Isaac Newton,"Newton, Isaac",,1642-1727," ",Opticks,"Newton's long-gestated record of optical experiments and their results, which he used to deduce the nature of light, refraction, diffraction, and color. The work's three books deal exclusively with physical optics. 'Queries' appear at the end, being rhetorical questions proposing ideas about the nature of light and color.
","The <i>Opticks<i> of 1704 is Newton's third attempt at producing a full description of his work in optics; and the only one published. Between 1670 and 1672 he fulfilled the requirements of his Lucasian Professorship and wrote his <i>Optical Lectures<i>, a comprehensive treatise on refraction and colors. But the criticism of his letter in the Philosophical Transactions announcing his theory of light and color had him set the work aside. They would not be printed until after his death. Newton did not take up optics again until after the publication of the Principia in 1687. This was a work he called the 'Fundamentum Opticae' and would eventually become Book I of the Opticks of 1704. What would become Books II and III were written by 1691 and involved that last experimental work Newton would do in optics. Material in what would have been Book IV dealt with diffraction and proved to be troublesome. His original theory regarding diffraction he himself experimentally disproved in 1692. What remained and eventually appeared in Book III regarding diffraction is, compared to Books I and II, tentative and incomplete. The uncertainly regarding diffraction, a half-hearted intention to conduct more thorough investigations into diffraction, and fear of more disputes delayed publication 12 years.||The <i>Opicks<i> appeared in February of 1704. It is a record of experiments and their results used to deduce the nature of light, refraction, diffraction, and color. The book deals with physical optics, rather than geometrical optics, and records Newton's final and most mature ideas regarding light and colors. At its core is Newton's desire to establish a mathematical foundation for what is now called physical optics. Book one deals with prism experiments, the spectral heterogeneity of white light, and the link between color and varying refractivity. The results of experiment 8 appear to show the invincibility of lens chromatic aberration--a result that cast a long shadow over lens development in the 18th century and was unchallenged until Samuel Klingenstierna's remarkable paper of 1754. Book two deals with color fringes in thin and thick plates. Book three deals briefly with diffraction. Queries appear at the end, rhetorically proposing ideas about the nature of light and color. This is the only edition that included two mathematical treatises on the calculus, published as part of Newton's priority dispute with Leibniz.||The two Latin mathematical tracts dealing with the calculus were immediately reviewed by Leibniz in the Acta Eruditorum, a review appeared in The History of the Works of the Learned in 1704, and a general review appeared in the Nouvelles de la R√©publique des Lettres for March 1706. Interestingly, this last review ends by expressing the hope that the work would be translated into Latin but notes that 'cependant l'auteur souhaite que personne ne le fasse sans sa participation.'--'however, the author does not want anyone to do it without his participation.'  The <i>Opticks<i> would have vast influence, particularly in the form of its Latin translation that appeared in 1706. It's fundamental propositions of the chromatic heterogeneity of white light and varying chromatic refrangibility would be generally accepted within 20 years. The corpuscular theory of light's nature, proposed in the Queries, would set the terms of the debate with the wave theory of light for all of the 17th century. English editions of the Opticks appeared in 1704, 1717, 1721, 1730, and 1931. A Latin translation appeared at London in 1706, 1719, at Geneva in 1740, at Padua in 1749 and 1773. A French translation appeared at Paris in 1720 and 1722.||This copy from the Tixall Library, a collection originally formed by the recusant Sir Walter Aston, First Lord Aston (1584-1639) of Tixall, Staffordshire, friend and patron of the poet Michael Drayton and British Ambassador to Spain under James I and Charles I. By the nineteenth century the library had descended to the Constable family. It was finally sold at Sotheby‚Äôs in London on 6th November 1899, as the late property of Sir F.A.J.C. Constable of Burton Constable and Aston Hall, in Yorkshire. Sale noted in the London Daily Mail, November 8, 1899.","The <i>Opticks<i> is in three Books. Book I is in two parts. Part I deals with prism experiments and the spectral heterogeneity of white light. It begins with definitions and axioms that review the basic aspects of geometric optics of reflection and refraction. This is followed by 8 propositions based on 16 experiments dealing with chromatic inhomogeneity and its consequences. Propositions 7 and 8 deal specifically with the limitations imposed on telescope objectives by what is now called chromatic aberration. Part II presents 11 propositions based on 17 experiments investigating the nature of color and the application of the theory of chromatic heterogeneity, particularly to the rainbow. It is here that Newton's 'experimentum crucis' of his letter of 1672 is presented in refined form and great detail.||Book II is in four parts. Part I presents 24 observations of the colored fringes produced by light passing through glass plates and thin lenses in contact in air and water. Part II presents a mathematical analysis of these observations, including Newton's method for determining small separating distances. Part III presents 20 propositions dealing with colors of natural bodies and their relationship to prismatic colors and color production in thin plates. it is here that Newton proposes that light has 'Fits of easy reflection and fits of easy transmission.' Part IV presents 13 observations of colors produced by thick plates.||Book III presents 11 descriptive observations of the color and placement of diffraction fringes produced by various objects.||Book III ends with 16 Queries; Newton's rhetorical questions proposing ideas about the nature of light and color. It is here that Newton dismisses wave theories of light as incapable of explaining its observed properties.","Twenty-Nine Years in the Making: Newton's <i>Opticks<i>|Shapiro, A.E.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 16, No 4, 2008, pp 417-438.||Opticks, or a Treatise of Light, 1687‚Äì1704|Rupert Hall, A.|In: <i>Isaac Newton: Adventurer in Thought<i>|Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp 279-293.||Skating on the Edge: Newton‚Äôs Investigation of Chromatic Dispersion and Achromatic Prisms and Lenses|Shapiro, A.E.|In: <i>Wrong for the Right Reasons<i>, Buchwald, J.Z., Franklin, A., editors, Springer, 2005, pp 99-125.||The Evolving Structure of Newton's Theory of White Light and Color|Shapiro, A.E.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 71, No 2,1980, pp 211-235.||Facing the Limits of Deductions from Phenomena: Newton‚Äôs Quest for a Mathematical-Demonstrative Optics|Ducheyne, S.|In: <i>The main Business of natural Philosophy<i>, Springer, 2011, pp 179-224.||Newton's theory of fits of easy reflection and transmission|Sakkopoulos, S.|<i>European Journal of Physics<i>, Vol 9, 1988, pp 123-126.||<i>Fits, Passions and Paroxysms<i>|Shapiro, A.E.|Cambridge, 1993, 391 pp, NB: pp 136-179.||Preface and Introduction|Cohen, I.B. and Whittaker, E.|In: <i>Opticks, Sir Isaac Newton<i>|Dover, New York, 1952, pp ix-lvii.","Opticks: or a Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light",,,1704,1700-1725,"English natural philosopher, mathematician, alchemist, Mint Master.

John Harris,"Harris, John",,1666-1710," ",Lexicon Technicum,"An encyclopedic dictionary that briefly defines words or describes concepts in what ranges from single sentences to essays. The emphasis is on mathematics and science.
","John Harris, Secretary of the Royal Society from 1709, was the first lexicographer to distinguish between a word-book, that is a dictionary, and a subject-book, that is, an encyclopedia. Harris' work is a hybrid, with entries varying in length from those typical of dictionaries to those of encyclopedias. It is also the first English encyclopedia presenting entries in alphabetical order. In his Preface, Harris makes clear his intention to provide a reference work of high utility, focusing on the 'arts and sciences' and to do more than just explain words, he wanted to explain the arts themselves. Harris's work was focused primarily on the mathematical sciences and their application. This emphasis was due, in part, to Harris's own background, the contributors he managed to assemble, and what he felt was missing in existing dictionaries. This content gave the work a unique and general appeal and, as Harris hoped, the reader would find the book 'useful to be read carefully over, as well as to be consulted like other Dictionaries occasionally.'||A review of the work, extending to the unusual length of four pages, appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1704. The <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> was long very popular, enduring through at least 1744 as the main rival of Ephraim Chambers's <i>Cyclopaedia<i>. Harris's Lexicon greatly influenced other dictionaries, providing material which was incorporated to increase the modernize the scientific and mathematical content of general dictionaries in England including The New World of Word by Phillips and Kersey, the anonymous <i>Glossographia Anglicana Nova<i>, the <i>Dictionarium Britannicum<i> of Nathan Bailey, and <i>New General English Dictionary<i> of Thomas Dyche and William Pardon. It is also clear that the <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> influenced Ephraim Chambers's <i>Cyclopedia<i> and Diderot's <i>Encyclop√©die<i>. The second volume of Harris' encyclopedic dictionary is mostly mathematical and astronomical tables, intended to serve as a small mathematical library.||Volume 1 of the <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> appeared in five editions: 1704, 1708, 1716, 1725, and 1736. Only the edition of 1704 included the list of subscribers. Volume2 appeared in three editions: 1710, 1723, and 1736. The final publication of the two volumes of the <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> was in 1736 and was the first time the two volumes were edited and issue simultaneously. A supplement was published in 1774, labeled Volume 3. It is not known who edited the work after Harris' death in 1719.
","John Harris's encyclopedic dictionary had an emphasis on mathematics and science, though it included topics from the humanities, arts, law, commerce, music, and heraldry. The contributors were recognized experts and generally produced essays that presented the latest contemporary information. Though considered a technical lexicon, this did not mean machines or manufacturing. It meant, rather, mathematics and its applications such as navigation, dialling, shipbuilding, architecture, fortification, optics and perspective. The second volume is mostly mathematical and astronomical tables, intended to serve as a small mathematical library.||The material on light and color is from Newton's 1672 letter in the Philosophical Transactions--Harris mentioning that the Opticks of 1704 came to late to hand be be studied and extracted carefully. The article on the Rainbow is by Edmond Halley. Additionally, there are articles on Optics, Optic Glasses, Optic Nerve, Reflection, Refraction in glass and air, Foci real and virtual, Colour, Eye, and Vision. The material related to physical optics is entirely Newtonian. The geometric optics material is contemporary, detailed, and analytic.","‚ÅÇ John Harris's <i>Lexicon Technicum<i>|Bradshaw, L.E.|In: <i>Notable Encyclopedias of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries<i>, Kafker, F.A., editor, Voltaire foundation, 1981, pp 107-123.||<i>Encyclopaedic Visions: Scientific Dictionaries and Enlightenment Culture<i>|Yeo, R.|Cambridge Universtiy Press, 2001, 341 p.||Diction and Dictionaries in the Diffusion of Scientific Knowledge: An Aspect of the History of the Popularization of Science in Great Britain|Layton, D.|<i>British Journal for the History of Science<i>, Vol 2, No 3, 1965, pp 221-234.","<i>Lexicon Technicum<i>: Or, an Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves.

Leibniz's immediate response as an anonymous review in the Acta Eruditorum set out his counter claim and made public a dispute that began 15 years earlier. Disputes aside, the review shows how quickly copies of the <i>Opticks<i> reached the continent. Leibniz must have had a copy just a few months after it appeared in February of 1704, since his review appeared in the Acta Eruditorum in January of 1705.","Leibniz reviews Newton's mathematical tracts, writing 'Accordingly, instead of the Leibnizian differences, Mr. Newton employs, and has always employed, fluxions, .... He has made elegant use of these both in his <i>Principia Mathematica<i> and in other publications since, just as Honore Fabri in his <i>Synopsis Geometrica<i> substituted the advance of movements for the method of Cavalieri.'

Isaac Newton,"Newton, Isaac",,1642-1727,"Translated by Samuel Clarke (1675-1729) English philosopher and cleric, correspondent, translator.",Optice (b),Samuel Clarke's Latin translation of the <i>Opticks<i> of 1704. Seven new queries are added to the sixteen that appeared in the <i>Opticks<i> of 1704. These queries famously dealt with the nature of light and related aspects of natural philosophy.,"Since the appearance of the <i>Opticks<i> in February 1704, Newton had intended to produce a Latin version, but by 1699 he had been in London, master of the Royal Mint, and had no time and little interest is performing the translation himself. His friend and younger contemporary Samuel Clarke was given the commission. Clarke was a seasoned Latinist as well as possessing the background necessary to understand the content of the Opticks. Famously, Newton was so satisfied with Clarke‚Äôs ‚Äúpure and intelligible Latin‚Äù, he paid Clarke 500 pounds for the work, 100 pounds for each of Clarke's five children. In his biography of Newton, David Brewster claimed that Abraham De Moivre eventually oversaw or edited the translation, but this apears to be confusion on Brewster's part about another Latin work of De Moivre.||Though no longer active in natural philosophy, Newton did produce new Queries for the Latin version of his <i>Opticks<i> in 1706. These additions include references double refraction and to Hauksbee‚Äôs early experiments dealing with the mercurial light. Newton added Query 23, the longest and most important, dealing with forces by which bodies act at a distance. This would be numbered Query 31 in subsequent English editions. Clarke worked closely with Newton on the project as evidenced by their decision to slightly change the text in new Query 20 involving space as God's Sensorium. The change was made after printing had begun, resulting in a cancel at Ss1.||The appearance of the <i>Opticks<i> in 1704 drew little attention. In letters to Abraham Sharp and  James Pound in May and November of 1704, John Flamsteed wrote 'Mr Newton has publisht his treaty of light and Colours (he calls it Opticks).' Flamsteed was generally critical and wrote  that it ‚ÄòMakes no noyse in Town (as the principia did).' But the <i>Optice<i> of 1706 was the most influential edition of any of Newton's optical writings. It was widely read in continental Europe and was the principle mechanism for the spread of Newtonian optics. The earliest references to Newton's optics in a European textbook appeared in Christian Wolff's <i>Der Anfangs-GruÃànde Aller Mathematischen Wissenschaften<i> of 1710, citing the <i>Optice<i> of 1706. But a far more extensive exposition appeared in Germany with the second edition of Johann Jakob Scheuchzer's <i>Physica, Order Natur-Wissenschaft<i> of 1711. It devoted a 30-page chapter to a description of Newton's experiments, his numerical results, and had 5 plates of figures replicating many of those in the <i>Optice<i>. In France, the <i>Optice<i> was read by Nicholas Malebranche and he cited it as supporting his idea that color was an inherent property of light related to the 'promptness' of its percussive vibrations.  The importance of the queries that appeared in the <i>Optice<i> was considerable; they set the agenda and tone of the debate regarding the wave or particle nature of light for much of the 18th century.||Editions of the Latin translation appeared in London in 1706 and 1719, in Geneva in 1740, in Graz in 1747, and in Padua in 1749.
","Like the <i>Opticks<i>, the <i>Optice<i> is in three Books. Book I is in two parts. Part I deals with prism experiments and the spectral heterogeneity of white light. It begins with definitions and axioms that review the basic aspects of geometric optics of reflection and refraction. This is followed by 8 propositions based on 16 experiments dealing with chromatic inhomogeneity and its consequences. Propositions 7 and 8 deal specifically with the limitations imposed on telescope objectives by what is now called chromatic aberration. Part II presents 11 propositions based on 17 experiments investigating the nature of color and the application of the theory of chromatic heterogeneity, particularly to the rainbow. It is here that Newton's 'experimentum crucis' of his letter of 1672 is presented in refined form and great detail.||Book II is in four parts. Part I presents 24 observations of the colored fringes produced by light passing through glass plates and thin lenses in contact in air and water. Part II presents a mathematical analysis of these observations, including Newton's method for determining small separating distances. Part III presents 20 propositions dealing with colors of natural bodies and their relationship to prismatic colors and color production in thin plates. it is here that Newton proposes that light has 'Fits of easy reflection and fits of easy transmission.' Part IV presents 13 observations of colors produced by thick plates.||Book III presents 11 descriptive observations of the color and placement of diffraction fringes produced by various objects. Queries--rhetorical questions--were Newton's means of proposing ideas about natural philosophy in general and the nature of light and color in particular. It is here that Newton dismisses wave theories of light as incapable of explaining its observed properties.  The Optice ends with the original 16 Queries of the Opticks, adds 7 new ones, and adds extensively to Queries 10 and 11. The Optice also provides an addendum describing luminescent light sources. Queries  17-23 are new in the Optice and deal with the nature of space, the plenum, the aether, and luminous corpuscles. Newton makes reference to Hauksbee's mercurial light and, ever-skeptical of Huygens' wave theory of light, adds an explanation for double refraction of certain crystals; an explanation based the corpuscular assumption of the nature of light. Query 23 is the longest and most important of all, by far, pondering the existence gravitational, magnetic, and electrical forces by which bodies can produce action-at-a-distance. He argues why these cannot be dismissed as 'occult forces' and suggest that other, more powerful forces may exist that are responsible for the interaction of light and matter. In this regard, Newton wonders if such forces could be both attractive and repulsive, depending on the distance over which they act. It would be this idea that Boscovich took up and developed it into his force law as part of his point-element theory of matter and force interaction. Query 23 ends with Newton's remarkable paragraph linking the development of natural and moral philosophy.","<i>Optics in the Age of Euler: Conceptions of the Nature of Light, 1700-1795<i>|Hakfoot, C.|Cambridge University Press, 1995, 243 pp, NB: pp 5-17.||The methodological origins of Newton‚Äôs queries|Anstey, P.R.|<i>Studies in History and Philosophy of Science<i>, Vol 35, No 2, 2004, pp 247-269.||The Case of the Missing Tanquam: Leibniz, Newton & Clarke:|Koyre, A. and Cohen, I.B.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 52, No 4, 1961 pp 555-566.||Les Queries de l'Optique|Koyre, A.|<i>Archieves Internationales d'Histoire des Sciences<i>, Vol 13, 1960, pp 15-29.||Sir Isaac and the ingenious Mr. Hauksbee|Guerlac, H.|In: <i>M√©langes Alexandre Koyr√©: L'aventure de la science<i>|Hermann, Paris, 1964, pp 228-253, NB 250-253.||Newton and God's Sensorium|Connolly, P.J.|<i>Intellectual History Review<i>, Vol 24, No 2, 2014, pp 185-201.||Enlarging the bounds of moral philosophy: Why did Isaac Newton conclude the Opticks the way he did?|Henry, J.|<i>Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London<i>, 2016, online.||The Reception of Newton's Optical Work|Shapiro, A.E.|In: The Reception of Isaac Newton in Europe, Pulte, H., Mandelbrote, S., editors, Bloomsbury Academic, 2019, 1004 pp, NB: pp 403-432.","Optice: sive de reflexionibus, refractionibus, inflexionibus & coloribus lucis libri tres.

Later addenda were on the human body and the senses.","The origin, in part, of Hartsoeker's <i>Conjectures Physiques<i> was his anti-Newtonian ideas and his ongoing desire to participate in the European community of letters. Though working primarily in optics, he was interested in many aspects of physics, particularly mechanics and its application to the natural world. He added to his conjectures on physics in 1708 and 1712 and answered his critics in the 'Clarifications' of 1710 and 1712. Unlike Hartsoeker's later <i>Course de Physique<i> of 1730, the <i>Conjectures Physiques<i> was not written to teach but to present and dispute.","The <i>Conjectures Physiques<i> is in four books. Book 1: The system of the work. Book 2: The Earth and its properties. Book 3: Principles of physics. Book 4: Meteorics. Discourse 4 in Book 3 is on Refraction and reflection of light and the luminous point. Hartsoeker presents a physical theory for reflection and refraction, based on the idea of the physical extent of light rays --patterned after the proposals of Emanuel Maignan. In Book 4 Hartsoeker presents a summary of atmospheric optical phenomena and a recension of Descartes's explanation of the formation of the rainbow. This includes the calculations showing the clustering of refracted rays around the angle 42 degrees, giving rise the angular size of the rainbow. Rainbow colors are considered to be the result of differing refractions at the last water air interface.||The <i>Suite de Conjectures Physiques<i> considers aspects of human anatomy and the <i>Seconde Partie de la Suite de Conjectures Physiques<i> considers vision, the eye, and the optical functions of seeing.

A summary overview of several aspects of mathematics and applied mathematics, used in Military and Civil Engineering, Architecture, and other trades.
","In his forward, Sturm makes clear his reason for writing this textbook. High schools in the German-speaking lands do not have suitable books for teaching Mixed Mathematics and applications. Books suitable for university use are too abstract and rest too heavily on theory for use in high schools. The presentation of the material must take the skill level of the student in mind and have an emphasis on the practical and the applied, if the students' interest is to be held. University text are usually in Latin and if a high school textbook is to be useful, it must be in German. The result is the first German-language high school textbook of Mixed Mathematics. The emphasis is mathematics applied to the practice of engineering, architecture, and other trades.||Editions appeared at Frankfurt in 1707 and 1710.

Part V is an Appendix of Necessary Mathematical Tables.||The section on optics and perspective is in four parts: Part I, General optics; Part II, Lens making; Part III, Perspective; Part IV, Anamorphosis. The material is almost entirely geometric optics; other than to establish the light ray as the principal manifestation of light, neither vision nor physical optics is treated. Light propagation, reflection, and refraction are described. Mirrors, plane and spherical, are discussed including the images they produce. Lens function is described in general terms, giving the basic properties of focal length and magnification. Lens use and function in telescopes is described. Finally, an elementary consideration is given to perspective and anamorphosis.||The treatment of optics is entirely descriptive, though detailed.

","Berkeley began writing <i>An Essay towards a new Theory of Vision<i> in 1707 and its publication in 1709 was an immediate success. Widely read and referenced by the educated public and specialists alike; Smith, Hartley, Porterfield are among the later writers in optics that drew on Berkeley and cited the <i>New Theory<i>--if only to refute it. The first two editions of the New Theory were published in Dublin in 1709. Revised versions appeared in 1732 being printed with the first and second editions of <i>Alciphron<i>. Significant changes were made in the Second Edition of 1709: In particular, sections 79 and 73 were reworded, modified and considerably extended, and an appendix was added. 
","A theory purporting to show how the distance, size, and orientation of an object are perceived through vision; providing a general criticism of vision theories based on geometry. The argument is made that, because all sensible objects are things we perceive by sense, and because nothing is perceived besides our own ideas, it follows that all sensible objects are ideas. Berkeley held that there were only four direct, immediate objects of visual sensation: shape, color, degree of faintness or clearness, and degree of confusion or distinctness. No others; all perceptions were held to arise from only these four--augmented perhaps by the sense of touch--and therefore perceptions involve learning and judgement. Additionally, the objects of sight and touch (or any two of the senses) are distinct and share no standard of measurement. These herald the later famed immatialism of Berkeley and his consideration of 'Molyneux's Question.'","‚ÅÇ Berkeley's Theory of Vision and its Reception|Atherton, M.|In: <i>The Cambridge Companion to Berkeley<i>|Winkler, K.P., editor|Cambridge University Press, 2005, pp 94-124.||<i>Berkeley‚Äôs Theory of Vision: A Critical Examination of Bishop Berkeley‚Äôs Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision<i>|Armstrong, D.

Francis Hauksbee,"Hauksbee, Francis",,1660-1713," ","Physico-mechanical experiments ","Experiments and resulting propositions regarding electricity and the generation of 'barometric light.'
","Francis Hauksbee performed important experiments with electrical apparatus of his design before meetings of the Royal Society. Newton's ideas on the nature of electricity were largely shaped by Hauksbee's experiments. These and other experiments were written up into papers that appeared in the Philosophical Transactions, which Hauksbee eventually collected and cast into book form. Editions appeared in 1709 and 1719. An Italian translation appeared at Florence in 1716, and a French translation at Paris in 1754.
","Hauksbee's book presents experiments and resulting propositions regarding electricity and the generation of 'barometric light', sometimes referred to as 'mercurial light.'  These experiments involved partial vacuum, static electricity, and what is now recognized as electro-luminescence of low-pressure discharges. The experiments and apparatus are described in great detail, with elaborate engraved figures. Taken together, the discussions present a theory of electricity and established a source of light that challenged current theories about the nature of light. Hauksbee used an air pump of his own design and construction to evacuate rotatable glass globes and cylinders, creating 'a fine purple light' inside them by rubbing the outside surface. The light would disappear gradually when air was let into the vessels, but at atmospheric pressure, rubbing (and so electrifying) the glass would enable it to attract woolen threads, etc. Hauksbee reports a series of experiments in optics, some of them concerning the refraction indices for a variety of substances, as measured by Snell‚Äôs law. In one such experiment he determined the indices for common air, vacuum and compressed air, using a hollow prism as well as an air pump and a condensing engine. He also developed a special instrument, made up of the prism, a stopcock, a gauge and a telescope.","‚ÅÇ Francis Hauksbee and his air pump|Brundtland, T.|<i>Notes and Records of The Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 66, 2012, pp 253-272.||Early Electricity between Chemistry and Physics: The Simultaneous Itineraries of Francis Hauksbee, Samuel Wall, and Pierre Polini√®re|Freudenthal, G.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 2, 1981, pp 203-229.||Francis Hauksbee's theory of electricity|Home, R.W.|<i>Archive for History of Exact Sciences<i>, Vol 4, No 3, 1967, pp 203‚Äì217.","Physico-mechanical experiments on various subjects.

","Poliniere first gave physics lectures at the College d'Harcourt at Paris in the mid 1690s and their success had them repeated in other colleges and in subsequent years. Poliniere was one of the first academic lecturers to incorporate demonstrations of physical principles. His lectures became demonstration/experiment based and their written form produced a kind of manual or list of experiments. Widely used and very popular, editions appeared in 1709, 1718, 1728, a posthumous edition based on manuscript notes in 1734, and a reprinting in 1741. King Louis XV himself attended the course given in 1722--according to the preface of the posthumous edition. The successive editions reveal a growing certainty about and reliance on experiment; first, simply to demonstrate principles, but eventually to discover them. The second edition of 1718 both introduces Newton's ideas regarding color, but also shows the lingering hesitancy about reliance on experiment. By the time of the third edition, Poliniere had become completely convinced of the soundness of the experimental method as the basis for physics. The experiments, their results, and conclusions drawn from them are now presented without the caution and hedging found in the earlier editions; he now asserts that the principles of physics can be discovered directly and reliably by experiment.","A manual of 100 experiments in natural philosophy; given is great detail, the results are explained with equal care. Experiments 84 through 100 deal with light and color. This includes: colors in chemical solutions and materials; refraction, prismatic colors, the rainbow and its production; burning mirrors; vision; lenses of convex and concave figure; camera obscura; spectacles and optical instruments; and phosphor. The treatment is Cartesian, elementary and qualitative, but very clear in presentation.","‚ÅÇ The Notion of Experimental Physics in Early Eighteenth-Century France|Home, R.W.|In: <i>Change and Progress in Modern Science<i>|Reidel Publishing, 1985, pp 107-131.||Poliniere and the teaching of physics at Paris: 1700-1730, Hanna, B.T.|In: <i>Eighteenth-Century Studies Presented to Arthur M.

","A summary of geometrical optics for the purpose of self-study and the consideration of optical instruments. Conradi's text does not rely on mathematics beyond geometry and is generally descriptive. Though it touches on the nature of light and color, the bulk of the text deals the geometric optics of instruments. In his preface Conradi claims that some of the instruments described are of his invention.  Conradi's text was reviewed and summarized in the Acta Eruditorum for July 1711 and a century later cited by Goethe in his <i>Zur Farbenlehre<i> of 1810 to support his theory of color. Conradi is also cited by Hertels in his <i>Neue Anmerckungen Vom Glasschleiffen<i> of 1738. Conradi's material on the magic lantern was used in Georg Kr√ºnitz's <i>Ekonomisch-technologische Encyclop√§die<i> Vol 65 that appeared in 1794. This included one of Conradi's images. The book was self-published by Conradi and  dedicated to the duke of Saxony, Anton Ulrich.

In four volumes with extensive figures.","The first great vernacular textbook of natural philosophy in Germany, and begins the so-called 'Anfangsgr√ºnde tradition' of textbooks. Wolff is preoccupied with correct teaching and what is necessary of full student understanding and so begins the book with Kurzer Unterricht von Der Mathematischen Methode oder Lehr-Art - Short Lessons about the Mathematical Method or, The Art of Teaching. One of the reasons for the text's great success was Wolff's refusal to make assumptions about what the reader or student knew, and his subsequent care in providing background, examples, and definitions. Wolff's textbook had little for almost fifty years. Editions appeared in 1710, 1716, 1725, 1730, 1737, 1743, 1750, 1755, 1763, 1775, with translations into Latin, Dutch, Polish, Russian, French, and Swedish. It was replaced only with books authored by the next generation of mathematicians in the second half of the 18th century: K√§stner, von Segner, Karsten, Clemm, and Kl√ºgel. A revised version of the text appeared in 1797.

Vol IV: rudiments of algebra and the differential and integral calculus. The optics section (118 pages) includes: optics, with a euclidean-geometrical explanation of perception; making and figuring glass and metal mirrors; burning mirrors and images from mirrors; mirrors for anamorphosis; refraction, lenses and their focal and imagining properties; making and use of microscopes and telescopes; magic lanterns. The treatment is practical and geometric, with the dioptrics receiving a more extensive and mathematical treatment.  The presentation is formal and very concise, with axioms, theorems and their demonstration, and comments in scholia introducing most material. Examples by way of problems are presented and solved. The optics material draws heavily from Dechales, Huygens, and Zahn. Newton's color theory is described, though Wolff freighted it with a mediumistic/mechanical basis.","<i>Teaching the Mathematical Sciences at French and German Universities during the 18th Century<i>|Confalonieri, S. and Kr√∂ger, D.|Cuvillier Verlag, 2016, pp 29-93.||Christian Wolff (1679-1754) and his contribution for the Mathematics Education|Nobre, S|<i>Proceedings of the XXth International Congress of History of Science<i>|Brepols, 2002, pp 89-94.","Der Anfangs-GruÃànde Aller Mathematischen Wissenschaften.

Johann Jakob Scheuchzer,"Scheuchzer, Johann Jakob",,1672-1733," ",Physica,A summary of physics for the general reader. The earliest presentation of Newtonian optics in Germany.,"Second edition of Scheuchzer's <i>Physica<i>. It presents a summary of late 17th century natural philosophy for the interested lay reader. Like Bernard Nieuwentyt, Scheuchzer felt that the natural world directly reflected the work and presence of God. Though he presents a compendium of natural philosophy, it is explicitly grounded in his religious beliefs. His preface makes clear his idea of the relation between physics and scripture. Physics is based on experience and reason, not on authority. Though the Bible does speak about certain natural facts, it is not a complete textbook on natural knowledge and cannot be used to decide controversies in physics. Still, he says 'it is uncontrovertible that any time that [the Bible], in the representation of spiritual and celestial things, speaks about the nature and properties of natural things, this saying has to be taken as divine and infallible.' However tictured with religion, Schenchzer work usually avoided such questions, and simply reported the results of works in natural philosophy. He is careful and detailed to cite the authors from he draws his material. He makes no original contributions of his own.||The second and subsequent editions of Scheuchzer‚Äôs <i>Physica<i> differ from the first, principally by  their changes to the original chapter on light and an entirely  new  chapter, some thirty pages long, devoted to Newton's theory of prismatic colors. Scheuchzer cites the <i>Optice<i> of 1706, the Latin translation of Newton's <i>Opticks<i> of 1704, and brings to the wider German public the first description of  Newton‚Äôs discoveries. Scheuchzer's <i>Physica<i> was cited by Goethe in his <i>Geschichte der Farbenlehre<i>, as an example of how Newton's color theory came to be accepted in Germany. Scheuchzer's summary of Newton's optics was  widely-known in Germany--the publication  history of Scheuchzer‚Äôs compendium  attests to its popularity--and  was  probably  the  chief  source  for the  dissemination  of Newton‚Äôs  optical theories in Germany after 1711. The only earlier reference was much shorter reference in Chrisitan Wolff's <i>Der Anfangs-GruÃànde Aller Mathematischen Wissenschaften<i> textbook of 1710.||Scheuchzer's <i>Physica<i> is the earliest of a series of works that brought Newtonian optics to Germany early in the 18th century. These include Johann George Hoffman‚Äôs <i>Kurtze Fragen  von  den Natiirlichen Dingen<i> of 1719, which fully accepts Newton‚Äôs  color theory, and Johann Matthaes Barth‚Äôs <i>Physica Generalior, oder kurze Satze von denen natiirlichen Korpern √ºberhaupt<i> of 1724, which describes and explains it. Editions of Scheuchzer's <i>Physica<i> appeared in 1701, 1711, 1721, 1729, and 1743.

","In his Forward, Scheuchzer cautions against adhering to one school of thought, mentioning Aristotle, Plato, Epicurus, Descartes, and Gassendi. Further, he argues for a mix of both sense-data (experiments) and reason, neither excluding the other. He cites Descartes as an example of reasoning without data. Scheuchzer holds that experiments, observations, and mathematics are required for natural philosophy, while hypotheses should be avoided.||The body of the <i>Physica<i> is in two parts and follows the traditional separation of <i>Physica Generalis<i> from <i>Physica Particularis<i>. Part 1 contains 37 chapters, dealing with the general aspects of natural philosophy: Mater and its properties, Motion of several types, Nature of Light. It is here that Scheuchzer devotes twenty-nine pages to a detailed summary of the <i>Optice,<i> including descriptions of the principal experiments and the precise reproduction of Newton's mathematical  tables  and  calculations. And though the section on motion presents several theories, the laws of motion from Newton's <i>Principia<i> have pride of place.||Part 2 contains 38 chapters dealing with particular aspects of natural philosophy: The heavens and planets, Air, Fire, Heat and Cold. Plants, Animals, and Man. In the chapters on astronomy, Scheuchzer discusses the geocentric and heliocentric systems of the universe and presents a extensive array of data about the planets and stars. Though he holds with the Copernican system, he does explain the Ptolemaic and Tychonian systems. He also gives, in  detail, the arguments both for and against the heliocentric system. His discusses Kepler‚Äôs planetary laws and how they are supported by Newton. In the chapters on the earth, he focuses on natural phenomena above, on, and beneath the its surface. This material is treated as a natural historian would,  describing and classifying a wide range of specific phenomena. There is a natural history of the waters, winds, stones and an especially detailed consideration of minerals. Animals and Man receive a briefer and more traditional treatment.

Color is presented as the effect the length 'longueur' of the rays, as distinct from their size 'grandeur.'

Anonymous,Anonymous,,," ",Optice Institutiones,"An anonymous students' lecture notes in Latin accompanied by diagrams, for a course in the eye, vision, and optical instruments.
","By the time these notes were produced (1713) The University of Parma had been staffed with a mixed Civil and Jesuit faculty for more than a century. Jesuits taught theology, philosophy (logic, natural philosophy, metaphysics), mathematics, and humanities. The Civil faulty taught law and medicine. These notes are for a course in optics given by one Padre Becano, SJ. The title <i>Institutiones Optice sive de Oculo Naturali<i>  show the intention of the text is to study the eye and vision. Just enough geometric optics is covered to allow for a consideration of ocular optics and the function of simple optical instruments. The text is accompanied by 20 leaves giving 63 very carefully hand-drawn figures. The text is in a small, round hand, in brown ink.
","The material centers on the eye and its function, the nature and characteristics of vision, and how simple optical instruments can aid vision. The ocular anatomy is that of Felix Plater and Kepler, but not yet that of Scheiner. Anatomy is covered just sufficiently to show how the eye forms images. Refraction and its role in the function of lenses is presented, along with the principles of focus, magnification, and images. The only material on geometric optics is simple ray-tracing through lenses. No physical optics is presented. The aspects of vision covered include size, position, motion, and binocular view. The material is descriptive, no mathematics in used. The presentation is elementary and traditionally Scholastic: Propositions, discussions, conclusions.","The Jesuits and Italian Universities, 1548-1773|Grendler, P.F.|The Catholic University of America Press, 2017, 506 pp, NB: pp 154-187.",Optice Institutiones In Universitate Parmensi exhibituqe Anno millisimo septuagesimo decimo tertio. a P.

Stephen Chauvin,"Chauvin, Stephen",Etienne Chauvin,1640-1725," ",Lexicon philosophicum,"A listing of terms and theories from philosophy and natural science, from Aristotelian to Cartesian but also Gassendian and other contemporary authors.","This is a reworking and significant extension of Chauvin's <i>Lexicon Rationale sive Thesaurus Philosophicus<i> of 1692, one of the earliest of dictionaries that covered natural philosophy. As the title implies, this is essentially a new work. It presenta a listing of terms and theories from philosophy and natural science, mostly Cartesian but also Gassendian and other contemporary authors, and so it reflects the state of learning at the start of the 18th century. The optical entries (<i>color, lens, lumen, lux, oculus<i>) are particularly long, detailed, and accompanied by clear engraved figures.||The Lexicon gives considerable space to each of three historical traditions: Scholastic teachings, the ideas of Descartes and the developments of Cartesians, and more modern impericist ideas. In general, the entries present an historical overview of the topic. It would be this aspect of the Lexicon that would cause it to be cited so often in the half-century following its publication.||Chauvin's <i>Lexicon<i> was widely used, being found in most European libraries. It was cited by scholars and reviewed in the Journal des S√ßavans and the Philosophical Transactions. Some of Chauvin's definitions and longer articles were reproduced later in Ephraim Chamber's <i>Cyclopedia<i> and in Diderot's <i>Encyclop√©die<i>, the <i>Encyclopedia Britanica<i>, and in Webster's <i>American Dictionary of the English Language<i>. Both John Harris in his <i>Lexicon Technicum<i> of 1704 and Ephraim Chambers in his <i>Cyclopedia<i> of 1728 cite Chauvin as inspiration and some-time source for their works. Regarding entries in natural philosophy, Chauvin's <i>Lexicon<i> was cited by Johann Sturm, Johannes Zahn, Pieter van Musschenbroek, by Thomas Johnson in his <i>Questiones Philosophicum<i>. Later textbook writers would cite entries from Chauvin's <i>Lexicon<i> not for the latest developments in natural philosophy, but rather for useful summaries of the history of the development of ideas.","In the sections of the Lexicon dealing with natural philosophy, Chauvin begins with a lexicographical lemma which is followed Chauvin's own summary definition. This is usually followed by extended, modified extracts from the many sources Chauvin uses. In natural philosophy these include: Aristotle, Albertus Magnus, Galileo, Kircher, Schott, Lana Terzi, Gobart, Descartes, Fabri, Grimaldi, Beckman, DuHamel, Boyle, Sturm, Dalrymple, Cally, and Newton.||The entry on color begins with Aristotle's definition and explanation, followed by that of the Cartesians. The entry ends with a long summary of Newton's hypothesis of prismatic colors and its consequences. The entry on lenses defines the various types, including that in the eye. Lens imaging is briefly described and spherical and chromatic aberration are mentioned. The entry for Lumen begins with a presentation of the history of ideas regarding the nature of light; from Aristotle to Descartes. The rest of the entry, the light ray is presented as the principle manifestation of light. Direct, reflected, and refracted light are considered. The entry for 'Luminis Trajectus' discusses the rectilinear propagation of light and the formation of pin-hole images. Given the extreme concision of all these entries, the accompanying figures play an important role in their presentation.","‚ÅÇ  <i>√âtienne Chauvin (1640 - 1725) and his Lexicon philosophicum<i>|Gaspari, G., translated by Poole, F.|Georg Olms Verlag, 2016, 264 pp, NB: pp 146-175.","Lexicon philosophicum secundis curis Stephani Chauvini, philosophiae professoris, et Regiae Scientiarum Societatis apud Berolinenses socii, ita tuÃÄm recognitum & castigatum : tuÃÄm varieÃÄ variis in locis illustratum; tuÃÄm passim quammultis accessionibus auctum & locupletatum, ut denuoÃÄ quasi novum opus in lucem prodeat.

","First edition of the first teaching compendium of natural philosophy in Castilian. Tosca wrote for his students, and the style and clarity of the books benefited from his long practice in teaching. The nine volumes are meant to cover all of mathematics and philosophy: I Arithmetic and Geometry, II Algebra and music, III Trigonometry and conics, IV Statics and Hydrostatics, V Civil and Military Architecture, VI Optics and Meteorics, VII Astronomy, VIII Geography and Navigation, IX Gnomics and Astrology. Tosca's textbooks were widely used and responsible, in part, for the introduction of modern science in Spain. The volumes of the first edition appeared at Valentia: V 1: 1707; V2: 1709; V3: 1710; V 4-5: 1712; V 6: 1713; V 7-9: 1715. The entire set was reprinted in Madrid in 1727 and 1757. Later in the century, Benito Bails would produced an equally comprehensive compendium, <i>Elementos de Mathem√°tica<i>, in which he acknowledged Tosca's work and its place in Spanish intellectual history.
","The first teaching compendium of natural philosophy in Castilian. Volume six contains five sections on optics and meteorics, treatises XVIII - XXII. Section I Optics: general considerations and definitions; nature and propagation of light; nature of colors; transparent and opaque bodies; view and vision; eye-function; perception of size and shape; binocular vision. Section II Perspective: principles, iconographic and orthographic projection; methods for representing objects in various orientations; linear perspective; perspective of light, shadow, and reflected bodies; perspective of curved surfaces. Section III Catoptrics: general considerations an definitions; plane mirrors and their properties; convex and concave mirrors; cylindrical mirrors; spherical mirrors, caustics; simple rules for placing images from mirrors. Section IV Dioptrics:  refraction and its effects; cause and properties of refraction; location of refracted images; refractive glasses and their properties; combining refracting bodies; convex lenses, concave lenses; refraction and the generation of colors. Section V Meteorics: the sea and the wind; atmosphere and clouds, all type of precipitation; lighting; lights generated in the air; the rainbow; other forms of light; comets.||Though the basis is essentially Cartesian, Tosca also cites Grimaldi, Kircher, Scheiner, Zahn, Dechales, Rheyta, Zucchi, but not Huygens (1690) or Newton (1704). The wave and corpuscular theories of the nature of light are presented, but each is considered unproven. But Tosca presents experiments that support the wave hypothesis and he invokes the the analogy to sound propagation as also supporting the wave hypothesis. Color theory follows Pardies and is a hybrid of Aristotelian and Cartesian. The material is detailed, descriptive, and presented with mathematics no more advanced than geometry.","El ""Compendio Mathem√°tico"" del padre Tosca y la introducci√≥n de la ciencia moderna en Espa√±a|Cu√©llar, M.R.|In: <i>Actas del Segundo Congreso Espa√±ol de Historia de la Medicina<i>,  Vol 1|Salamanca, 1965, pp 325-359.||<i>La introducci√≥n de la ciencia moderna en Espa√±a<i>|L√≥pez Pi√±ero, J.

Wells's purpose was to provide textbooks written in simple language that could be use by student and craft practitioner. His audience required an emphasis on the practical application of knowledge and though the material is mainly descriptive, geometry is used extensively. In optics, for example, Wells foundation is vision and his preface states that he wishes to be about not 'only explaining the Manner of Vision in a Geometrical Way, but also by the same Principles teaching how to supply or remedy the several Defects of the Sight, by the Help of proper Instruments, such as Spectacles.'||Wells's texts were standbys, widely used in England and America in the first half of the 18th century. The three volumes appears between 1712- and 1714. Between 1718 and 1736 parts of the books were reissued separately: The <i>Young Gentleman's Astronomy, Chronology, and Dialling<i> issued in 1718, 1725, and 1736; The <i>Young Gentleman's Arithmetick and Geometry<i> issued in 1723, and <i>The Young Gentleman's Trigonometry, Mechanicks, and Opticks<i> issued in 1731.
","The optics section (74 pages) includes: elementary geometrical optics, ocular anatomy, euclidean-geometric visual perception; reflection, plane and spherical mirrors and the images created; refraction, lenses of convex and concave figure and the images created; the magic lantern, microscope, and telescope; and perspective. The optics material is complete in elementary essentials, geometry-based, and accompanied by 66 figures.","The teaching of elementary geometry in the seventeenth century|Kokomoor, F.W.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 11, No 1, 1928, pp 85-110.||The Book Collections of Early American College Libraries|Kraus, J.W.|<i>The Library Quarterly<i>, Vol 43, No 2, 1973, pp 142-159.","The Young Gentleman's Trigonometry, Mechanicks, and Opticks.

","English translation of Gregory's Latin lecture notes on optics printed as <i>Catoptric√¶ et dioptric√¶ sph√¶ric√¶ elementa<i> in 1695, together with an extensive addendum. Browne's long introduction recounts the very basics of optics regarding lenses and cites the great utility of their use in telescopes and microscopes, and the discoveries made with those instruments. Browne was physician but, though competent in optics and mathematics, was not a specialist and so had John Desaguliers review his translation. Desaguliers encouraged its publication. Editions appeared in 1715 and 1735, the latter by Desaguliers who added an introduction and a history of the reflecting telescope.
","Browne's translation of the Latin includes the entire text of the 1695 Latin edition as well as additions and corrections that he mentions as 'all along in the Translation explain'd such Passages as the  Author's Laconick Style has made something too puzzling for a Beginner, and corrected several considerable Faults of the Press, which has escaped his Care.' Browne also added an addendum that is as long again as the translated text. The first part of this adds some mathematical detail and missing steps to several proofs, particularly involving the Calculus, where Browne uses Leibniz's notation rather than fluxions. He also solves several of the problems Gregory left as an 'exercise for the reader,' gave a general method for finding mirror and lens foci, and provided extensive notes from Huygens regarding the function and use of the telescope and microscope.","David Gregory and Newtonian Science|Eagles, C.M.|<i>The British Journal for the History of Science<i>, Vol 10, No 3, 1977, pp 216-225.","Dr. Gregory's elements of catoptrics and dioptrics.

On this occasion Hauksbee showed a striking experiment: when mercury rushed into the evacuated receiver of his new model air pump, spilling over an inverted glass vessel, the result was a sparkling light, ‚Äúa Shower of Fire descending all round the Sides of the Glasses.‚Äù It seems clear that Hauksbee, an experimental genius but a scientific autodidact, derived his theoretical principles from Newton.

John Theophilus Desaguliers,"Desaguliers, John Theophilus",,1683-1744," ",Physico-mechanical lectures,"Notes meant to be used by attendees of lectures demonstrating aspects of natural philosophy. One of the earliest public courses in science printed in Britain. 
","By the time Desaguliers published these public lecture notes, he had been giving lectures at Oxford for 7 years. and had become the de factor curator of experiments to the Royal Society, a position once held by Robert Hooke and then Francis Hauksbee. The lectures were meant for both student and popular audience, explaining and advancing Newtonian science. As stated in the letter To the Reader, the notes--referred to as 'papers'--were printed at the request of the course auditors, were essentially only minutes taken at the lectures themselves, and were printed and made available to eliminate the need for attendees to take their own notes. Importantly, Desaguliers makes clear that the notes themselves should be considered only a memorandum, lacking many details, but promising that a fuller accounting of the contents of the lectures will be forthcoming.||Desaguliers's 'papers' appeared in 1717. In 1719 one of the lecture attendees, Paul Dawson, published a transcript of the Lectures with Desaguliers's knowledge or permission. Desaguliers failed to prevent the distribution of the book, but did force the publishers to include a Preface Desaguliers wrote, expressing his dismay, the errors he found in the text, and many corrections. In 1725 a short syllabus for the lectures appeared, being an advertising piece and not a rendering of content. Desaguliers's full course in natural philosophy eventually appeared in two volumes in 1734 and 1744. Though optics was originally intended to be treated in the second volume, by the time Desaguliers came to write it, Robert Smith's elaborate A Compleat System of Opticks of 1738 had appeared. Desaguliers decided to simply refer his readers to Smith's treatise.
","The notes cover lectures on astronomy, mechanics, hydrostatics, optics, electricity and machinery. Lectures XVI to XXII cover optics (40 pages) and include: basic ocular anatomy and eye function; reflection and refraction; lenses and their imaging basic properties; microscopes; telescopes. Lecture XXII presents a summary of Newton's theory of heterogeneous, prismatic colors. The presentation is elementary, practical, and descriptive, without any mathematics. They are, as the preface states, minutes taken from the lectures, with each section accompanied by the recounting of one or more experiments for demonstration. The latter is at the heart of the notes and Desaguliers' method. He held that teaching natural philosophy required clear, observable demonstrations of facts, and that unornamented abstractions of theory do not suffice. Thus, the most important aspect of the notes are the descriptions of demonstrations. Generally, Desaguliers devised simplified equipment that could, in the case of optics, easily be obtained and used to demonstrate all significant optical phenomena that the lectures presented.","<i>John Theophilus Desaguliers: A Natural Philosopher, Engineer and Freemason in Newtonian England<i>|Carpenter, A.T.|Continuum, 2011, pp 177-203.||Jean The!ophile Desaguliers (1683-1744) and eighteenth century vision research|Wade, N.J.|<i>British Journal of Psychology<i>, Vol 91, 2000, pp 275-285.||Competing to Popularize Newtonian Philosophy: John Theophilus Desaguliers and the Preservation of Reputation|Wigelsworth, J.R.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 94, 2003, pp 435-455.","Physico-mechanical lectures, or, An account of what is Explain'd and Demonstrated in the course of Mechanical and Experimental Philosophy, given by J.T.

","de Mairan's essay was part of the response to a development at the opening of the 18th century: scholarly societies began to offer prizes for essays dealing with general problems. The prize offered by the Bordeaux Academy of Science is an example. The prize was announced in 1714 and de Mairan submitted his winning entry not long after. The essay shows the thinking current at the time regarding the nature of light and the attempts to make either of them account for common luminous phenomena--in the case of the Academy's prize, the various forms of luminescence and phosphorescence. The first half of the essay presents the two then-current theories of light: wave propagated in an aether or the emission of luminous corpuscles. de Mairan believe in the latter, and the remainder of the essay attempts to explain a wide range of luminous phenomena on that basis.||de Mairan's essay was printed at Paris in 1715 and at Bordeaux in 1717.
","Prize essay on luminescence for the Bordeaux Academy of Science. First part discusses the then-current theories of the nature and propagation of light: aetherial waves or luminous corpuscles. de Mairan held that the luminous corpuscles consisted of sulfur--one of the five chemical 'principles' known at the time. The second part considers phosphors and night lights and consider them in two groups: natural and artificial. Natural phosphors were animal, plant, and insect lights, as well as mineral and agitation-based lights such as rubbed diamonds of crushed sugar. Artificial phosphors were atmospheric phenomena as well as the burning phosphor of Kunkel and the Bolognian Stone. There is nothing experimental or demonstrative in de Mairan's essay; he threads together a set of explanations from a few basic ideas to cover a very wide range of phenomena.","‚ÅÇ <i>A History of Luminescence<i>|Harvey, E.N.|American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 1957, 692 pp, NB:  pp 151-154.","Dissertation sur la cause de la lumiere des phosphores et des noctiluques.

Newton's fundamental propositions of the chromatic heterogeneity of white light and varying chromatic refrangibility was generally accepted by the time this edition appeared. The corpuscular theory of light's nature, proposed in the Queries, would set the terms of the debate with the wave theory of light for all of the 17th century. The Queries were renumbered in this and subsequent editions. English editions of the <i>Opticks<i> appeared in 1704, 1717, 1721, 1730, and 1931.

Query 31, new in the Optice, is the longest of all, by far, and deals with gravitational attraction and ends with Newton's remarkable paragraph linking the development of natural and moral philosophy.. Queries 17-24, new in the second English edition, deal with the Newton's idea of the aether or subtle, particular matter and its interaction with heat and light.

","John Craig produced three important, pioneering treatises on the Calculus and a long series of works on the application of the calculus. The <i>De Optica Analytica<i> is an example of the latter: an early application of the Calculus to optical problems. Craig was the an early British user of Leibniz's notion for the calculus, but in <i>De Optica Analytica<i> he reverted to Newton's notation, probably in keeping with the work with which it was published. The <i>De Calculo Flentium Libri Duo<i> was reviewed in the <i>Acata Eruditorum<i> for April 1719: a favorable assessment and an extended summary.
","Contains the <i>De Optica Analytica<i>, a treatise on catoptrics and dioptrics. The treatise (25 pages) includes: A first section on catoptrics, developing geometric optics for mirrors of conic sections, giving equations for evaluating and designing curves derived using the Calculus; A second section on dioptrics giving a mathematical analysis of spherical and elliptical lenses, including spherical aberration. In the case of both catoptric, and dioptrics, establishes equations expressing the properties of mirrored or lensed imaging systems and uses the calculus to find foci, distances, and radii of curvature. Examples are provided in each case.","A history of the study of mathematics at Cambridge|Rouse Ball, W.W.|Cambridge, 1889, 264 pp, NB: pp 77.",De Calculo Fluentium Libri Duo (with) De Optica Analytica,,,1718,1700-1725,Scottish methematician and theologian.

Jacques Rohault,"Rohault, Jacques",,1618-1672,"Translated by Samuel Clarke (1675-1729) English philosopher and cleric, correspondent, translator.",Physica,"Fourth edition of Samuel Clarke's Latin translation of Jacques Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> of 1671, a complete textbook of Cartesian-based natural philosophy. Fully empirical, with numerous experiments and observations reported to test theory and hypothesis. Cartesian optics includes the nature of light, color, transparency and opacity.","At the end of his preface to the first French edition of the <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> of 1671, Jacques Rohault mentions that he was 'preparing a Latin version in favor of foreigners, in whom I dare promise myself a fairly favorable reception.' But Rohault never publish a Latin translation. The first was this very close translation produced by the Geneva physician TheÃÅophile Bonet which appeared at Geneva in 1674. It was reprinted at London and Amsterdam in 1682, at Amsterdam in 1691 and 1700 and at London in 1691 with notes by the Franciscan Antoine Le Grand, at Amsterdam in 1708 and Cologne in 1713 with notes by both Le Grand and Samuel Clarke. For use at English universities, Clarke made a second Latin translation that appeared at London in 1697 and preprinted in 1702, 1710, and 1718 (this edition). It was into these editions of his Latin translation of Rohault that Clarke added every more numerous and lengthy notes, augmenting, supplanting, and eclipsing Cartesianism with Newtonianism.||Clarke's translation was one of the most widely used textbooks in Europe in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The influence of Clarke's translation and his notes rested on the way it introduced and propagated Newton's physics among all those who were not keen on mathematical details of physical processes, but interested in the new explanatory quality of Newtonian physics. This is a reprinting of the third edition of 1710, the last Clarke produced in his life time, and contains half-again as many notes as the previous edition, now comprising nearly one-fifth of the book, and eight additional plates of figures. This was the third and last revision and extension that Clarke made of his notes and since by this time the <i>Optice<i> of 1706 had appeared, it was heavily referenced in the optics section.","Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> is in four parts. Part 1 is in 35 chapters and covers principles of physics, nature of matter, motion and its analysis, forms of matter, heat and cold, the senses of taste, smell, and hearing, and finally the eye, optics, and vision. The Cartesian principles of extension, divisibility, motion, and rest are used to deduce general laws of statics, dynamics, and--via ballistic conceptions  of reflection and refraction--optics. Part 2 is in 29 chapters and covers cosmography, astronomy, selenography, the planets and their movements, the fixed stars, and finally the competing theories of the sun and planets. Rohault plumps for the Copernican as the most rational. Part 3 is in 17 chapters and covers geology in general, including the Earth and things that are part of it, such as the atmosphere, the seas, metals and minerals, fountains, winds, fogs and clouds, rain and hail, snow and frosts, lighting, and finally the rainbow. Part 4 is in 26 chapters and covers anatomy, muscles and movement, blood and circulation, digestion and breathing, and finally maladies and disease.||The optics material, though patterned closely after Descartes' essay La Dioptrique, it is fully empirical with experiments, demonstrations, and observations reported to test theory and hypothesis. The topics include: the nature of light, color, transparency and opacity. Direct, reflected, and refracted light are demonstrated as well as the simpler forms of image formation by mirrors and lenses. Descartes theory of vision is presented in full. All the optical topics are treated in an elementary but thorough manner. Thus, for example, the focusing properties of spherical convex lenses are demonstrated, but nothing is said of spherical aberration.||Experiment receives a double role: on the one hand, it is shown how it discriminates between conjectures pointing to the ones that are empirically confirmed; on the other hand, it is a powerful pedagogical tool that can convince the reader of explanations given and laws stated.||As with the other topics, Rohault's Cartesian optics is accompanied by Samuel Clarke's notes containing additions, amplifications, and corrections derived from Newton's <i>Opticks<i> of 1704 and the <i>Optice<i> of 1706.","Samuel Clarke‚Äôs Annotations in Jacques Rohault‚Äôs <i>Trait√© de Physique<i>, and How They Contributed to Popularising Newton‚Äôs Physics|Volkmar Sch√ºller, V.|In: <i>Between Leibniz, Newton, and Kant<i>, Wolfgang Lefovre, editor,  2001, NB: pp 95-110.||Rohault's Cartesian Physics|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Cartesian Empiricisms<i>, Springer, 2013, pp 203-226.||Rohault's Traite de Physique and its Newtonian Reception|Dobre, M.|In: <i>Proceedings of the 4th International Conference of the ESHS<i>, 2010, pp 389-394.||The experimental physics of Jacques Rohault|Spink A.|<i>British Journal for the History of Philosophy<i>, Vol 26, No 5, 2017, pp 850-870.||The Study of Early Scientific Textbooks|Sarton, G.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 38, No 3/4, 1948, pp 137-148.||Motion and God in XVIIth Century Cartesian manuals: Rohault, R√©gis and Gadroys|Milani, N.E.|<i>Noctua<i> Vol 2, Nos.1-2, 2015, pp 481-516.","Jabobi Rohaulti Physica.

Willem Jacob ¬¥s Gravesande,"¬¥s Gravesande, Willem Jacob",,1688-1742," ",Physices elementa mathematica,"The <i>Physices elementa mathematica<i>, a handbook of physics covering virtually all of its subjects, is the basis for 's Gravesande's subsequent handbooks and textbooks.
","The <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> is the foundation of 's Gravesande's fame, and the basis for his subsequent other handbooks and textbooks which became the most important and influential of the Newtonian educational works on the continent and in England. It relied on what it presented as the Newtonian notion of dependence on only experiment and geometry. The content, scope, and style of the <i>Physices Elementa Nathematica<i> and it's various subsequent versions were both embodiment and extension of 's Gravesande's deeply influential teaching and the reason the books were so influential in the 18th century. They had sufficient compelling clarity to help eventually overcame the predominance of Cartesianism in France and the Leibnizian-Wolffianism of Germany and Russia.|The first edition of the Latin text appeared in 1720, the second edition of 1725 was enlarged and intended more for scientific peers rather than students, the edition of 1742 was extensively reworked and augmented, and the last edition appeared in 1748. The <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> was also translated into English by Desaguliers, appearing in six editions, and into French in 1745. A portable, one-volume abridgement of the Latin text appeared in 1723.
","A handbook of physics covering: statics; dynamics; gravity; fluids; fire, heat, light, and electro-luminescence; optics; system of the world; and celestial motion. The optics section (90 pages or about 15% of the text) includes: the nature and propagation of light; refraction; Newtonian spectral refraction; spherical lenses; eye and vision; spectacles for vision correction; microscopes, telescopes, and their use; reflection and catoptrics; the magic lantern; color, chromatic heterogeneity of white light, spectra, the rainbow, colors of thin plates, colors in nature. The main points are demonstrated by experiments, their presentation detailed and geometry-based. Numerous detailed figures, descriptions of demonstration apparatus and their use, and elaborate cross-referencing are notable.||The physical optics that 's Gravesande's text presents has fire and light as manifestations of an 'elemental fire', with both sharing many of the same properties. The fundamental aspect of propagation is emission--as opposed to traveling waves--and the interaction of light with materials in reflection, refraction, and diffraction is ascribed to the effect of forces operating over very small distances. 's Gravesande's emission theory is a kind of filtered and simplified version of Newton's ideas; it avoids any mention of the aether that Newton mentioned in the later Queries of the Optice of 1706, does not deal with double refraction, and does not mention Newton's fits of easy transmission and reflection or his suggestion regarding 'sides' or 'poles' of the light particles. Also notable is the absence of consideration of any other theory of the the nature of light and its propagation.","‚ÅÇ ‚Äôs Gravesande and Musschenbroek: Newtonianism at Leiden|Ruestow, E.G.|In: <i>Physics at Seventeenth and Eighteenth-Century Leiden: Philosophy and the New Science in the University<i>|Springer, 1973, 174 pp, NB: pp 113-139.||The impeccable credentials of an untrained philosopher: Willem Jacob 's¬†Gravesande's career before his Leiden professorship, 1688‚Äì1717|Jip van Besouw|<i>Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 70, No 3, pp 231‚Äì249.|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4978728/","Physices elementa mathematica, experimentis confirmata.

Isaac Newton,"Newton, Isaac",,1642-1727,"Translated by Pierre Coste (1668-1747) French theologian, writer, prolific and important translator.",TraiteÃÅ d'Optique (a),"A French translation of the second edition of the <i>Opticks<i> of 1718. The translator's prefaces gives a brief, general history of color theory, followed by a more detailed account of the effect of Mariotte's failure to replicate Newton's experimentum crucis and its eventual experimental verification demonstrated later by Desaguliers.
","Though not explicitly linked, the origins of Coste's translation are likely rest on three things. First, the successful demonstration by Theophilus Desaguliers of Newton's 'experimentum crucis'--showing the heterogeneity of white light and the immutability of monochromatic light--at the Royal Society in London in Februrary 1715. Present were three members of the French Academy of Sciences: the mathematician Pierre R√©mond de Montmort, the astronomer Jacques-Eugene d'Allonville (Chevalier de Louville), and the chemist C.J. Geoffroy. Second, as mentioned in Coste's Preface, the repetition of this demonstration In Paris to several members of the French Academy. Third, the gradual eclipse of Mariotte's negative assessment of Newton's chromatic ideas as evidenced by changes in the content of French texts on natural philosophy regarding color, such as Pierre Polin√®re's Exp√©riences de Physique and the change of the optics material from Cartesian to Newtonian in the first and second editions of 1709 and 1718.||Coste's translation is based on the second English edition of the <i>Opticks<i> of 1718, including the 31 Queries; presented here as questions. The Coste's prefaces gives a brief, general history of color theory, followed by a more detailed account of the effect of Mariotte's failure to replicate Newton's experimentum crucis and its eventual experimental verification demonstrated later by Desaguliers. The preface also states that the translation was undertaken at 'the order of a great princess'--this was Caroline of Anspach, Princess of Wales. Newton granted permission for the translation and its publication and Desaguliers looked over the manuscript.||Coste's translation was reviewed in the May 1720 issue of Journal des S√ßavans. Importantly, the reviewer finds the translation important since very few persons in France had 'thoroughly explored the reasons Mr. Newton used to support his system.' This was a direct reference to the long, detailed description of the 'experimentum crucis' that was given in the experiments and propositions of Book I, Part I of the Opticks. Just as importantly, this was the first appearance in French of the Queries that appeared in the Opticks of 1704 and the Optice of 1706. Translations of Newton's Prefaces for the English editions of 1704 and 1717/1718 are provided. A second and far more elaborately produced edition of <i>TraiteÃÅ d'Optique<i> appeared in 1722.","The preface gives a brief, general history of color theory, followed by a more detailed account of the effect of Mariotte's failure to replicate Newton's experimentum crucis and its eventual experimental verification demonstrated later by Desaguliers. For the main text, Coste follows the English closely. The translation is in three Books. Book I is in two parts. Part I deals with prism experiments and the spectral heterogeneity of white light. It begins with definitions and axioms that review the basic aspects of geometric optics of reflection and refraction. This is followed by 8 propositions based on 16 experiments dealing with chromatic inhomogeneity and its consequences. Propositions 7 and 8 deal specifically with the limitations imposed on telescope objectives by what is now called chromatic aberration. Part II presents 11 propositions based on 17 experiments investigating the nature of color and the application of the theory of chromatic heterogeneity, particularly to the rainbow. It is here that Newton's 'experimentum crucis' of his letter of 1672 is presented in refined form and great detail.||Book II is in four parts. Part I presents 24 observations of the colored fringes produced by light passing through glass plates and thin lenses in contact in air and water. Part II presents a mathematical analysis of these observations, including Newton's method for determining small separating distances. Part III presents 20 propositions dealing with colors of natural bodies and their relationship to prismatic colors and color production in thin plates. it is here that Newton proposes that light has 'Fits of easy reflection and fits of easy transmission.' Part IV presents 13 observations of colors produced by thick plates.||Book III presents 11 descriptive observations of the color and placement of diffraction fringes produced by various objects. Queries--rhetorical questions--were Newton's means of proposing ideas about natural philosophy in general and the nature of light and color in particular. It is here that Newton dismisses wave theories of light as incapable of explaining its observed properties. The second English edition of the <i>Opticks<i> contains the original 16 Queries of the <i>Opticks<i>, the 7 added in the <i>Optice<i> of 1706, and 8 new ones. The 8 Queries new in the second English edition are placed after the original 16 and are number 17-24. The 7 Queries new in the <i>Optice<i> of 1706 are here numbers 25-31, and adds extensively to Queries 10 and 11. The <i>Optice<i> also provides an addendum describing luminescent light sources. Queries  25-31 were new in the Optice and deal with double refraction and, perhaps most importantly, the nature of space, the plenum, the aether, and luminous corpuscles. Query 31, new in the <i>Optice<i>, is the longest of all, by far, and deals with gravitational attraction. Queries 17-24, new in the second English edition, deal with the Newton's idea of the aether or subtle, particular matter and its interaction with heat and light. Also new in the second English edition is reference to the ""mercurial light"" of Hauksbee's experiments.","<i>Newton on the Continent<i>|Guerlac, H.|Cornell University Press, 1981, pp 144-163.||<i>Traducteur huguenot: Pierre Coste<i>|Rumbold, M.

Nicolaas Hartsoeker,"Hartsoeker, Nicolaas",,1656-1725," ",Recueil de plusieurs pieces de physique,"A consideration and rejection of Isaac Newton's theory of gravity and its application to celestial phenomena.
","Nicolaas Hartsoeker initially held with Descartes' theory of vortices and their role in the motion of comets. Though he would eventually move away from Cartesianism and establish his own conjectural system of natural philosophy, at the time these pieces, he held that planets and comets moved by vortices. The motion of  comets seemed to Hartsoeker to be a particular failure of Newton's system of gravity and that is what he argues in these pieces. Hartsoeker's ideas never acquired much reach, with Huygens and other prominent natural philosophers find his conjectures unsupported and strange.
","The first section is a letter to Jean Le Clerc and outlines Hartsoeker's objections to then-current systems of natural philosophy. This is followed by ""Reflections"" in which Hartsoeker pursues his objections to Netwon's system, citing the motion of comets in particular. He then presents his own system, including that to explain planetary and cometary motion.","Controversies over Comets: Isaac Newton, Nicolas Hartsoeker, and Early Modern World-Making|Abou-Nemeh, C.|In: Reading Newton in Early Modern Europe|Boran, E. and Feingold, M., editors|Brill, 2017, pp 147-191.||Nicolas Hartsoeker's Syst√®me of Nature: Physics by Conjecture and Optics by Design in Early Modern Europe|Abou-Nemeh, C.|Dissertation, Princeton University, 2012, 254 pp.",Recueil de plusieurs pieces de physique,Collection of Several Physical Pieces,,1722,1700-1725,"Dutch mathematician, natural philosopher, oculist, microscopist.

Isaac Newton,"Newton, Isaac",,1642-1727,"Translated by Pierre Coste (1668-1747) French theologian, writer, prolific and important translator.",TraiteÃÅ d'optique,"Second edition of the French translation of the second edition of the <i>Opticks<i> of 1718. With a new preface by the translator.
","The origins and production of the second edition of Coste's French translation of the <i>Opticks<i> of 1717/1718 rests principally with the mathematician and friend of Isaac Newton, Pierre Varignon. Varignon was asked by officials governing Royal Privilege for his opinion regarding publishing Coste's translation in France. Varignon approval contained high praise for the book and its author. Varignon would become overseer for the project of publishing the translation in France and to some extent Coste became somewhat of an unhappy bystander to the entire process. At one point, Varignon brought in the French Chancellor Henri Fran√ßois d'Aguesseau to bring the book's wayward publisher-bookseller to heel--a token of the importance given the book by a wide and influential audience. Abraham De Moivre was asked by Varignon to suggest changes to the text and submit them to Newton for approval. Coste also suggested changes but Varignon would take none of Coste's suggestions unless they were approved by Newton himself. In this way Newton became tangled up in the production of the book, eventually approving Coste's suggested changes, to the annoyance of Varignon, though the changes suggested by both De Moivre and Coste were not significant.||Varignon and Chancellor d'Aguesseau rejected early proof sheets and directed the printer to use new type. These sheets were shown to Newton for his approval and, at Verignon's suggestion, left significant space at the start of each Part for a vignette. At Varignon's request, Newton himself provided a sketch for the first of these; it and the others were drawn in final form by Jean Chaufourier and engraved by Antoine Herisset. As in the first edition, translations of Newton's Prefaces for the English editions of 1704 and 1717/1718 are provided. The new edition appeared in quarto at Paris in 1722 and marked the near-general acceptance of Newton's optical theories in France.

","One of the most important and influential of European Newtonian textbooks. Based on and condensed from the <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> of 1720, it's spare and clear presentations in straightforward Latin aimed very specifically at students, disseminated Newtonian physics throughout Europe. The presentations were the essence of 's Gravesande's lectures and are notable for the accompanying instruments and demonstration/experimental apparatus. The presentations and apparatus were widely copied and used by authors of other books and professors of other university courses. Translations appeared in English, French, and Dutch. The Latin text appears in many editions: at Leyden in 1723, 1725, 1744, 1766, and 1774,  at Leyden and Amsterdam in 1728, at Venice in 1749, and at Vienna in 1760.","Textbook of Newtonian physics covering: matter, statics, and simple machines; dynamics; fluids, hydraulics, pneumatics; fire, heat, and light; color; system of the world, universal gravity. The optics section (89 pages) includes: refraction on plane and curved surfaces, dioptrics, and spherical lenses; eye function; microscopes and telescopes; reflection, catoptrics, plane and spherical mirrors; the magic lantern; color, Newton's theory of white light chromatic heterogeneity; the rainbow, colors from thin plates, colors in nature. The presentation is detailed and geometric. Numerous detailed figures, descriptions of demonstration apparatus and their use, and elaborate cross-referencing are notable.||The physical optics that 's Gravesande's text presents has fire and light as manifestations of an 'elemental fire', with both sharing many of the same properties. The fundamental aspect of propagation is emission--as opposed to traveling waves--and the interaction of light with materials in reflection, refraction, and diffraction is ascribed to the effect of forces operating over very small distances. 's Gravesande's emission theory is a kind of filtered and simplified version of Newton's ideas; it avoids any mention of the aether that Newton mentioned in the later Queries of the <i>Optice<i> of 1706, does not deal with double refraction, and does not mention Newton's fits of easy transmission and reflection or his suggestion regarding 'sides' or 'poles' of the light particles. Also notable is the absence of consideration of any other theory of the the nature of light and its propagation.","<i>Optics in the Age of Euler: Conceptions of the Nature of Light, 1700-1795<i>|Hakfoot, C.|Cambridge University Press, 1995, 243 pp, NB: pp 42-46.||<i>Physics at Seventeenth and Eighteenth-Century Leiden: Philosophy and the New Science in the University<i>|Ruestow, E.G.|Springer, 1973, 174p, NB: pp 113-139.||<i>The History of Science in the Netherlands: Survey, Themes and Reference<i>|Van Berkel, K., Van Helden, Al, Palm, L., editors|Brill, Leiden, 1999, pp 68-95, 450-453.",G.J.'sGravesande Philosophiae Newtonianae Institutiones in usus Academicos.,G.J.

","By the time John Clarke produced this English translation of Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i>, his brother Samuel Clarke's notes has been developing for nearly 25 years in the Latin form that accompanied Clarke's 1697 Latin translation of Rohault's text, having been thoroughly revised twice. The notes had become elaborate, themselves notated, and nearly 1/3 as long as Rohault's text. Three editions of this translation with notes appeared (1723, 1728/9, 1735) and were prompted, perhaps, by the rapidly fading Latin skills of English students, and the continuing need for textbook of natural philosophy in English Universities. The text was also used extensively in America. The book was presented as Cartesian physics with Newtonian refutation and was used widely until the middle of the 18th century.

Barth is cited later by Goethe regarding Newton's theory of colors.

","Bernard  Nieuwentyt's best-known work. A widely read and influential physico-teleological book. Quite apart from any teleological success it may have had in converting atheists and skeptics, it was important in the spreading of knowledge of natural philosophy. The descriptions are clear, accompanied by detailed figures, and the content correct and up-to-date by contemporary standards, setting out 'all the late discoveries in anatomy, philosophy, and astronomy.' In this regard, the English editions include a supporting letter from John Desaguliers, who also approved of the editing the translator had done to tone-down the more forceful Christian aspects, leaving the work more aligned with Natural Religion and Deism, and thus open to a wider audience. The English translation appeared in five editions in 1718, 1720, 1724, 1730, and 1745.
","Third edition of the English translation  of the Dutch text of 1715, seeking to demonstrate the existence of God by teleological argument (of nearly 1000 pages): Nature, by its purposiveness exhibits the hand of a creator.   The  text  is  concerned  with  medicine  (the  heart,  nerves, muscles, and hearing), natural history  (the earth, fire, botany, zoology, etc.) and science  (chemistry,  astronomy,  and  physics). Never before had this been tried on such a scale, and none among Nieuwentyt's numerous imitators equaled his completeness. Rather  than  relying  on  a  few  examples,  he reviewed  the  whole  of  natural  science to show in detail how marvelously things fitted in the world. His work looks like a manual of up-to-date science  One of many topics is light and vision (16 pages). Ocular anatomy is considered in detail. Light is treated as radiant linear rays that can be reflected and refracted. Biconvex lenses and their images are introduced to show how the eye functions as a camera obscura, and to show how sight can be corrected with spectacles. The descriptions are often accompanied by experiments. Those aspects that involve physical optics are Newtonian; including the corpuscular nature of light.","The formation of the Newtonian philosophy: the case of the Amsterdam mathematical amateurs|Vermih, R.|<i>British Society for the History of Science<i>, Vol 36, No 2, 2003, pp 183-200.||Physico-Theology or Biblical Physics?|Vermij, R.|In: <i>Physico-theology: Religion and Science in Europe, 1650‚Äì1750<i>|Blair, A., von Greyerz, K., editors|NB: pp 162-165.","The religious philosopher: Or, the right use of contemplating the works of the creator.

Pieter van Musschenbroek,"Musschenbroek, Pieter van",,1692-1761," ",Epitome Elementorum Physico-Mathematicorum,"Musschenbroek's resume of his physics lectures, derived from the physics in Newton's Principia and the Opticks","While Musschenbroek was teaching at Utrecht, he produced this resume of his physics lectures. The preface makes clear that his lecture course is derived from the physics in Newton's <i>Principia<i> and the <i>Opticks<i>. The manner of presentation and demonstration benefits from the work of Giovanni Poleni, Willem Jacob 's Gravesande, Bernard Nieuwentyt, and Herman Borhaave, and that their publication is in the long tradition of the university. More so than his teacher 's Gravesande, Musschenbroek was a prolific textbook writer and this was the first in a long series of successful, widely used, textbooks in natural philosophy. But considered in light of those later works, the epitome is only an early essay in Musschenbroek's developing craft of exposition and explanation. The epitome is notable for establishing Musschenbroek's style: the material is not presented in the common oracular fashion, rather, all principal ideas and facts are accompanied, in a quite modern fashion, by footnotes. Their number and extent are some of the most remarkable aspects of Musschenbroek's Epitome, making it something of a summary and guide to the then-contemporary literature on natural philosophy.
","A summary of a course of lectures in natural philosophy based on Newtonian ideas and theories. The material covered includes: history and progress of physics; space, bodies, and their nature; motion; Newtonian laws of motion; gravity; mechanics; material properties; motion under attractive power; fluids and their motion; fire; optics. The optics material (56 pages) includes: nature and propagation of light; reflection and refraction; colors; the eye and eye-function; vision; catoptrics; and dioptrics. The optical material is essentially Newtonian, though reference is made to a wide range of optical works: Descartes, Huygens, Gregory, Wolff,  's Gravesande, Hauksbee, Molyneux, Mariotte, Desaguliers, Dechales, Gassendi, Briggs, Malebranche, Rohault, Traber, Cherubin d'Orleans, and numerous references to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Memoires of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and the Journal de Scanvans. The presentation is extremely concise and entirely descriptive; no mathematics is involved and no figures are provided.

Giovanni Rizzetti,"Rizzetti, Giovanni",,1675-1751," ","De luminis affectionibus ","A thoroughgoing attack on Newton's theory of colors and white light homogeneity.
","The origins of Rizzetti's book is his paper <i>De Systemate Opticae Newtonianae et de Aberratione in Humore Chrystallino<i> that he submitted to the Royal Society in London in 1722 and to the <i>Acta Eruditorum<i> in 1724. The paper claimed to have found Newton's experiments either faulty or inconclusive and--in Rizzetti's view--failing to support Newton theory of heterochromatic white light and the immutability of monochromatic light. He reported his failure to reproduce Newton's experiment involving black thread on blue and red-colored cards and claimed that prismatic colors were the result of aberrations in the lens of the eye. In London, John Theophilus Desaguliers responded with an article in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society reporting the public demonstration of Newton's experiment and calling on Rizzetti to admit his errors. In Germany, the mathematician Friedrich Richter answered Rizzetti with a severely critical article that appeared in the same issue of the Acta Eruditorum as Rizzetti's. All this seems to have simply spurred Rizzetti: five years after his first paper, he published <i>De Luminis Affectionibus<i>, a book containing a large number of additional experiments and a long diatribe against Newton. Desaguliers responded with a 35-page paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society reporting the repetition of experiments before the Royal Society and several foreign visitors, including four Italian Abb√©s. Unlike his response to Rizzetti's paper of 1722, in 1728 Desaguliers is sharp, critical, and aggressively defensive of Newton. The response to Rizzetti's book in Italy was embarrassment and uniformly negative. It prompted Fracensco Algarotti to consider a public response which would take the form of his famous <i>Newtonianismo  per  le  Dame<i>. Rizzetti's book is important in that the swift, thorough, and unanimous negative response shows the extent and completeness with which Newtonian optical ideas had taken hold in Europe by the time of Newton's death.
","Rizzetti's work contains two Books. Book One contains four chapters and a summary: The refraction of light; Refrangibility of colors; The dispersion of light; The reflection of light; The nature of light. Book two contains a prologue, four chapters, and a summary: Colors in general; Natural colors; Apparent colors; Celestial phenomena; Imaginary colors; The nature of colors||The work attempts to be a thoroughgoing attack on Newton's theory of colors and white light homogeneity. Rizzett's preface contains a long diatribe against Newton and sets the polemic nature of the entire work. A few of Newton's experiments are presented as either failing or false and so Rizzetti rejects all of Newton's optical theories. The nature of light and color that is presented is a throwback to Scholastic teaching and there are many polemically-presented experiments with results that were claimed to contradict the ideas of Newton. Remarkably, the idea of color dispersion is rejected entirely and the old theory that color is a modification or mixing of white and black in invoked. Prismatic colors are dismissed as the result of aberrations within the eye.","‚ÅÇ The Reception of Newtonian Optics in Italy|Casini, P.|In: <i>Renaissance and Revolution: Humanists, Scholars, Craftsmen and Natural Philosophers<i>|Cambridge University Press, 1993, 308 pp, NB pp 215-228.||Optical Experiments Made in the beginning of August 1728, before the President and Several member of the Royal Society, and other Gentlemen of Several Nations, upon Occasion of Signior Rizzetti's Opticks, with an Account of the Said Book|Desaguliers, J.T.|<i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 25, 1727, pp 596-629.",De luminis affectionibus specimen physico mathematicum Johannis Rizzetti in duos libros divisum.

","Second, posthumous impression of the first teaching compendium of natural philosophy in Castilian. Tosca wrote for his students, and the style and clarity of the books benefited from his long practice in teaching. The nine volumes are meant to cover all of mathematics and philosophy: I Arithmetic and Geometry, II Algebra and music, III Trigonometry and conics, IV Statics and Hydrostatics, V Civil and Military Architecture, VI Optics and Meteorics, VII Astronomy, VIII Geography and Navigation, IX Gnomics and Astrology. Tosca's textbooks were widely used and responsible, in part, for the introduction of modern science in Spain. The volumes of the first edition appeared at Valentia between 1707 and 1715. The entire set was reprinted in Madrid in 1727 and 1757.","The first teaching compendium of natural philosophy in Castilian. Volume six contains five sections on optics and meteorics, treatises XVIII - XXII. Section I Optics: general considerations and definitions; nature and propagation of light; nature of colors; transparent and opaque bodies; view and vision; eye-function; perception of size and shape; binocular vision. Section II Perspective: principles, iconographic and orthographic projection; methods for representing objects in various orientations; linear perspective; perspective of light, shadow, and reflected bodies; perspective of curved surfaces. Section III Catoptrics: general considerations an definitions; plane mirrors and their properties; convex and concave mirrors; cylindrical mirrors; spherical mirrors, caustics. Section IV Dioptrics:  refraction and its effects; cause and properties of refraction; location of refracted images; refractive glasses and their properties; combining refracting bodies; convex lenses, concave lenses; refraction and the generation of colors. Section V Meteorics: the sea and the wind; atmosphere and clouds, all type of precipitation; lighting; lights generated in the air; the rainbow; other forms of light; comets. Though the basis is essentially Cartesian, also cited are Grimaldi, Kircher, Scheiner, Zahn, Dechales, Rheyta, Zucchi, but not Huygens (1690) or Newton (1704). The wave and corpuscular theories of the nature of light are presented, but each is considered unproven. Color theory follows Pardies and is a hybrid of Aristotelian and Cartesian. The material is detailed, descriptive, and presented with little mathematics.","El 'Compendio Mathem√°tico' del padre Tosca y la introducci√≥n de la ciencia moderna en Espa√±a|Cu√©llar, M.R.|In: <i>Actas del Segundo Congreso Espa√±ol de Historia de la Medicina<i>, Vol 1|Salamanca, 1965, pp 325-359.||La introducci√≥n de la ciencia moderna en Espa√±a|L√≥pez Pi√±ero, J.

In his preface to this volume, ¬¥s Gravesande mentions the volumes published in 1724 and notes that they did not contain Latin renderings of Huygens' only published work on optics, his <i>De La Lumiere<i>. 
","This part includes a printing of Latin versions of <i>Traite de la lumiere<i> (<i>De Lumine<i>), <i>Discours de la cause de la pesanteur<i> (<i>De Causa Gravitatis Dissertatio<i>), and <i>Geometria Dissertatio<i>. The <i>De Lumine<i> is a Latin rendering of Huygens' principal printed work on optics. The <i>Traite De La Lumiere<i> is in six chapters. Chapter 1: On Rays Propagated  in Straight Lines. Chapter 2: On Reflection. Chapter 3: On Refraction. Chapter 4: On Refraction of the Air. Chapter 5: On the Strange Refraction of Iceland Crystal. Chapter 6: On the Figures of Transparent Bodies Which Serve for Refraction and Reflection.||Chapter 1 reviews the classic phenomena of optics and how their nature and properties comprise required outcomes for any theory of light. These include rectilinear propagation of rays, equal angle reflection, and the sine law of refraction. The chapter then sets out Huygens' theory of wave propagation: A wave front produces wavelets with all but motion locally perpendicular to the original wave cancel, the cumulative effect leaves a new, advancing wave front. Spherical wave fronts generated in this way radiate from each point on a luminous surface. Rays of light are taken as the perpendiculars to wave fronts. Chapter 2 applies this principle to explain the equal angle law of specular reflection. By invoking the finite speed of light wave travel, the perpendiculars to the series of reflected wave fronts (reflected rays) are are show to make angles with the surface perpendicular that are equal to those of the rays of the incoming waves. Chapter 3 applies the same analysis, based on finite light wave speed to explain the sine law of refraction. Wave front speed is slower in denser media; the denser, the slower. Wave fronts travel more slowly once in the denser medium and a geometric construction shows their perpendiculars (the refracted rays) form an angle with the refracting surface perpendicular whose sine in ratio to that of incident rays is the ratio of the media densities. That is, the sine law of refraction. Chapter 4 applies wave front refraction to atmospheric refraction, showing how it produces curved rays. Chapter 5 explains the double refraction observed in Icelandic spar. In this case, Huygens proposes that refracted waves propagate in two directions in the crystal.   The wavelets for waves propagating in the 'extraordinary' direction are not spherical but elliptical and the resulting non-spherical wave fronts have perpendiculars that are the extraordinary rays of double refraction. Chapter 6 uses wave front analysis to determine ideal figures for reflecting and refracting surfaces. It is here that the cause of spherical aberration is derived. Huygens was a practiced oculist and though he shows the theoretical benefits of elliptical and hyperbolic figures for lenses, he is aware that as a practical matter, they were essentially impossible to produce.","<i>Lenses and Waves<i>|Dijksterhuis, F.J.|Kluwer, 2004, pp 213-253.","Chrisitani Hugenii Zulichemi, Dum viveret Zelhemi Toparcae, Opera Reliqua Tomus Primus.","Remaining Works of Christian Huygens of Zuilichem, Govenor of Zelhem while alive.",,1728,1725-1750,"Dutch mathematician, natural philosopher, oculist.

Isaac Newton,"Newton, Isaac",,1642-1727,Translated by Henry Pemberton?,Optical Lectures,"An English translation of the first part of the Newton's Optical Lectures of 1670-1672, covering the refraction of light and it mathematical and geometric analysis.
","An English translation of the Part 1 of the second revised version of the <i>Lectiones Opticae<i>, titled <i>Optica<i>; corresponding to parts of Book I of the <i>Opticks<i> of 1704. The <i>Optica<i> is the longer, revised version of Newton's optical lectures and rearranges and separates the original material in the <i>Lectiones Opticae<i> into two sections. The first deals with refraction and its analysis. The second section deals with Newton's theory of color. In the thrity years that had elapsed since the notes were written and when the <i>Opticks<i> of 1704 appeared, Newton had considerably developed and refined his color theory. As the translator states in the Preface, it is for this reason, and that much of the mathematics in Part 1 of the <i>Optica<i> does not appear in the <i>Opticks<i> of 1704, that the translation was limited to Part 1 of the <i>Optica<i>. The translator apparently worked from an imperfect copy of the Latin text held by David Gregory which he received from Newton in 1701--the notes being nearly 30 years old by that time. The differences between a good copy of the original Latin text and that used by the translator is apparent when it is compared to the editio princeps that appeared in 1729, with the translator/editor having to patch and fill in a few places. The result was rushed into print after Newton's death and, as is clear from the preface, the publication of the translation was as much an act of tribute as of scholarship.||Though the intent was to make public the mathematical and geometric detail of that part of the optical lectures dealing with refraction, in the half-century since the notes were written, much of the material was, if not obsolete, then developed more extensively in later works.
","An English translation of the Latin, Part 1 of the second revised version of the Optical Lectures, including: Part I Description of prismatic experiments, analysis of the results, and conclusions regarding the inhomogeneity of white light; Part II Theory, instruments, and practice of measuring refraction; Part III Refraction at plane surfaces and the consequences of heterogeneous light; Part IV Refraction at curved surfaces and the consequences of heterogeneous light. The translation presents that part of the optical lectures that are deeply mathematical and cover geometrical optics. He finds image points in a form equivalent to and preceding that of Gauss, and uses his own mathematical developments--series expansions and finding maxima and minima--to find spherical aberration and what is now called the circle of least confusion. In Part IV, Newton shows how large chromatic aberration is compared to spherical aberration--1500 times--emphasizing the importance of his discovery of heterogeneous light's varying refrangibility.","‚ÅÇ  <i>The Optical Papers of Isaac Newton, Volume I: The Optical Lectures 1670-1672<i>|Shapiro, A.E., editor|Cambridge University Press, 1984, 624 p.","Optical Lectures Read in the Publick Schools of the University of Cambridge, Anno Domini, 1669.

The distances of two sources that illuminated a split visual field were changed until the field was equally bright; the ratio of the square of the distances gave the relative luminous power of the two sources.,"Bouguer's interest in the measurement of light began with articles by Dortous Mairan in 1719 and 1721 regarding the power of the sun to light and heat differently in summer and winter. Bouguer apparently borrows the visual comparator first shown in Aguilon's <i>Opticorum<i> of 1613, and Dechales's law of diminishing luminous power derived from the geometry of the sphere, to devise a reliable method of relative photometry based on equality of visual perception. The Essai formed the basis for the first part of Bouger's posthumously published TraiteÃÅ d'Optique of 1760. A modern reprinting of the Essai appeared at Paris in 1921.

Benjamin Worster,"Worster, Benjamin",,fl 1730," ",A Compendious and Methodical Account of the Principles of Natural Philosophy,"An introductory text of natural philosophy covering Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, and Optics. ","An introductory text of natural philosophy covering Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, and Optics. Benjamin Worster and Thomas Watts had been engaged by Richard Steele to deliver a course in natural philosophy at Steele's Censorium--his presentation theater. This course was design to offer the English equivalent to Desagulier's course given in French at the Censorium. Worster and Watt's course of lectures began in 1719. Watts later engaged Worster at his own Academy in Little Tower Street to teach experimental and natural philosophy, and this text was written expressly to accompany this course of lectures delivered by Worster. The first edition appeared in 1772 and the second edition produced from corrections and additions in Worster's hand. The long introduction, 'To The Reader,' is by the publisher and bookseller Stephen Austen and sets out the reason for the second edition and recounts some of Worster's ideas from the edition of 1722.||Worster's intent is clear from the introduction quoted by Austen: not to describe or recount experiments or their apparatus, but to show how philosophical principles are deduced from experimental results. In this regard, Worster is and adherent and admirer of Bacon. Austen also recounts Worster's summary of gravity and central attractive forces.","An introductory text of natural philosophy covering Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, and Optics, meant to accompany Worster's series of experimental lectures. There are six sections. 1: Of Natural Philosophy in General. 2: Mechanics. 3: Laws of Motion. 4: Hydrostatics. 5: Pneumatics. 6: Optics. The optics section is the longest and most detailed. Rays of light are considered 'streams of Aether' but treated in a purely geometric fashion. Reflection and refraction as plane and spherical surfaces are considered. Interestingly, Worster's text contains one of the earliest image of a light ray path encountering a surface repulsive force, thus producing reflection. To account for refraction, Worster employes an elaborate version of Newton's 'Fits'. Simple convex and concave lenses are considered with analysis limited to determining focal points. Simple ocular anatomy is presented, together with a summary of the visual process. Mirrors, prismatic colors, natural colors of bodies, and the rainbow are also discussed. It is shown on lenses can be combined to produce the telescope and the microscope. The treatment of geometric optics is descriptive, with only elementary geometry being invoked. Physical optics - the reason for reflection and refraction - is expressed in terms of attractive forces and their action on light rays. The last sections list brief descriptions the experiments in Worster's lecture course. Twenty-four experiments are listed for Optics.","The Selling of Newton: Science and Technology in Early Eighteenth-Century England'|Stewart, L.|<i>Journal of British Studies<i>, Vol 25, No 2, April 1986, pp. 178-192.||'Richard Steele's Censorium'|Loftis, J.|<i>Huntington Library Quarterly<i> , Vol 14, No 1, Nov. 1950, pp. 43-66.||The Problem of Reflection in Eighteenth-Century Projectile Theories of Light|Breno Arsioli Moura|<i>Physics in Perspective<i>, Vol 22, 2020, pp 191-214.","A Compendious and Methodical Account of the Principles of Natural Philosophy.

Willem Jacob ¬¥s Gravesande,"¬¥s Gravesande, Willem Jacob",,1688-1742,"Translated by John Theophilus Desaguliers (1683-1744) British natural philosopher, engineer, Anglican priest. Popular lecturer on Newtonian physics, demonstrator at the Royal Society, prolific author.",Mathematical elements of natural philosophy,"Fourth edition of the English translation of 's Gravesande's <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> of 1720.
","Desaguliers was a friend of 's Gravesande and knew his work well. That it was thought likely that an English translation of 's Gravesande's book would sell well is clear from the fact that the booksellers Senes and Taylor asked Desaguliers to produce a translation. It was commercially successful, widely read and used and became one of the most important English textbooks on Newtonian natural philosophy. Six editions appeared: 1720, 1721, 1726, 1731, 1737, and the posthumous edition of 1747. The second edition followed the first rapidly, containing corrections to printing errors and mistakes in the plates. This, the fourth edition of Desaguliers's translation, was based on what was at the time the latest text of 's Gravesande. The Latin text would be greatly expanded by 's Gravesande in 1742 and Desaguliers would produce a greatly expanded translation.
","Fourth edition of the English translation of 's Gravesande's <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> of 1720. 's Gravesande had produced a handbook of physics covering: statics; dynamics; gravity; fluids; fire, heat, light, and electro-luminescence; optics; system of the world; and celestial motion. The optics section (90 pages or about 15% of the text) includes: the nature and propagation of light; refraction; Newtonian spectral refraction; spherical lenses; eye and vision; spectacles for vision correction; microscopes, telescopes, and their use; reflection and catoptrics; the magic lantern; color, chromatic heterogeneity of white light, spectra, the rainbow, colors of thin plates, colors in nature. The main points are demonstrated by experiments, their presentation detailed and geometry-based. Numerous detailed figures, descriptions of demonstration apparatus and their use, and elaborate cross-referencing are notable.||The physical optics that 's Gravesande's text presents has fire and light as manifestations of an 'elemental fire', with both sharing many of the same properties. The fundamental aspect of propagation is emission--as opposed to traveling waves--and the interaction of light with materials in reflection, refraction, and diffraction is ascribed to the effect of forces operating over very small distances. 's Gravesande's emission theory is a kind of filtered and simplified version of Newton's ideas; it avoids any mention of the aether that Newton mentioned in the later Queries of the <i>Optice<i> of 1706, does not deal with double refraction, and does not mention Newton's fits of easy transmission and reflection or his suggestion regarding 'sides' or 'poles' of the light particles. Also notable is the absence of consideration of any other theory of the the nature of light and its propagation.","John Theophilus Desaguliers: A Natural Philosopher, Engineer and Freemason in Newtonian England|Carpenter, A.T.|<i>Continuum<i>, 2011, pp 115-125.","Mathematical elements of natural philosophy, Confirmed by experiments; Or, an introduction to Sir Isaac Newton's philosophy.

","A theory purporting to show how the distance, size, and orientation of an object are perceived through vision; providing a general criticism of vision theories based on geometry. The argument is made that, because all sensible objects are things we perceive by sense, and because nothing is perceived besides our own ideas, it follows that all sensible objects are ideas. Berkeley held that there were only four direct, immediate objects of visual sensation: shape, color, degree of faintness or clearness, and degree of confusion or distinctness. No others; all perceptions were held to arise from only these four--augmented perhaps by the sense of touch--and therefore perceptions involve learning and judgement. Additionally, the objects of sight and touch (or any two of the senses) are distinct and share no standard of measurement. These herald the later famed immatialism of Berkeley and his consideration of 'Molyneux's Question.'","‚ÅÇ Berkeley's Theory of Vision and its Reception|Atherton, M.|In: <i>The Cambridge Companion to Berkeley<i>|Winkler, K.P., editor|Cambridge University Press, 2005, pp 94-124.||<i>Berkeley‚Äôs theory of vision: A critical examination of bishop Berkeley‚Äôs Essay towards a new theory of vision<i>|Armstrong, D.

DuFay is interested in the process of gathering light at one place and sending it to another, possibly distant place, via a non-diverging parallel beam--a very early example of what would now be called energy transport. DuFay's earlier work in translating treatises on craft, lead to his work and experience with gold leaf.

","Musschenbroek reworked his <i>Epitome Elementorum Physico-Mathematicorum<i> of 1726, notes for a student course in physics, into this textbook. The topics and structure are same as those in the Epitome, but the treatment has been greatly expanded by including the experiments, demonstrations, and equipment Musschenbroek used in his lectures, as well as figures, geometry, and trigonometry to make the presentation clearer and more detailed. Given the inclusion of experiments and demonstrations, the textbook contains many fewer citations to other works than did the Epitome. Compared to other writers, and in particular to his fellow countryman Willem Jacob 's Gravesande, Musschenbroek was more daring with hypotheses, relying heavily on experiment and collected data rather than on formulating general laws. He was cautious not to introduce unverifiable hypotheses and expressed an honest acknowledgement of what was not known. He was also willing to tackle magnetism, electricity, heat, and other similar phenomena which were difficult to quantify or to cast into general laws, and which were, for that reason, often not considered by other textbook writers.||Editions of Musschenbroek's textbook appeared at Leiden in 1734,  1741 and expanded form  in 1748, at Venice in 1745, 1752, 1761, 1781, and 1794, at Naples in 1745, 1751, 1761, and 1771, at Madrid in 1807.  It was translated into English in 1774, German in 1747, and Swedish in 1747.

By the time Ferrari wrote this, his thinking had evolved away from Scholastic Aristotelianism and had aligned with the natural philosophy of Gassendi, parts of Descartes and Malebranche, and the optics (but not the gravity) of Newton. In many sections, particularly those on optics and the physics of light, a summary history is given ranging from the ideas of Epicurus and Aristotle, through Descartes and Malebranche, to Huygens and Newton. The textbook shows that though Ferrari had moved away from most of the physics of Descartes and presents that of Newton, he continued to assume a fundamental mechanistic basis of physics and was unwilling to grant that (merely) the predictive accuracy of Newton's equation was evidence of the reality that was hypothesized to underlie them. In this sense, Ferrari's text is an example of the bridging that was taking place between Cartesian and Newtonian ideas. Widely used throughout Europe, the textbook was, for example, recommended as the physics text for use at the University of Seville in 1768. Editions appeared at Brexia in 1735, 1745, and 1751, posthumously at Venice in 1756, 1761, and in the Opera Omnia of 1792.

","English translation of Gregory's Latin lecture notes on optics printed as <i>Catoptric√¶ et dioptric√¶ sph√¶ric√¶ elementa<i> in 1695, together with an extensive addendum. Browne's long introduction recounts the very basics of optics regarding lenses and cites the great utility of their use in telescopes and microscopes, and the discoveries made with those instruments. Browne was a physician but, though competent in optics and mathematics, was not a specialist and so had John Desaguliers review his translation. Desaguliers encouraged its publication. The first edition appeared in 1715 at London. This edition of 1735 was brought out by Desaguliers since the first edition was out of print and there was sufficient demand for another. Desaguliers added a long appendix, an introduction and a history of the reflecting telescope. See Entry 262.

","By the time John Clarke produced this English translation of Rohault's <i>Trait√© de Physique<i> of 1671, his brother Samuel Clarke's notes has been developing for nearly 25 years in the Latin form that accompanied Clarke's 1697 Latin translation of Rohault's text, having been thoroughly revised twice. The notes had become elaborate, themselves notated, and nearly 1/3 as long as Rohault's text. Three editions of this translation with notes appeared (1723, 1728/9, 1735) and were prompted, perhaps, by the rapidly fading Latin skills of English students, and the continuing need for textbook of natural philosophy in English Universities. The text was also used extensively in America. The book was presented as Cartesian physics with Newtonian refutation and was used widely until the middle of the 18th century.

The result is linear ray propagation.

Jean Picard,"Picard, Jean",,1620-1682," ",Fragmens de dioptrique,"Collected papers on dioptrics presented by Picard to the French Academy of Sciences.","A collection that contains a reprinting of the Fragmens Dioptrique of 1693. Between 1677 and 1679, Jean Picard presented a series of lectures on dioptrics to the French academy. In 1679 Pierre de Carcavi, mathematician and secretary of the National Library of France, proposed that Edm√© Mariotte, astronomer Philippe de La Hire and Picard produce a full treatise on optics for the Academy. Though the collaboration never took place, it was this project that apparent prompted Picard to begin a set of notes which he worked on until his death.||As the Preface makes clear, the volume collects works from several prominent authors in many areas, and in most cases is based on presentations made to the French Academy of Sciences. The editor was Philippe de la Hire, who had received several manuscripts from Jean Picard, who, in turn, had been entrusted with manuscripts of Bernard Fr√©nicle de Bessy, Christiaan Huygens, and Gilles Personne de Roberval for printing. Eventually, de la Hire would add the other works the volume contains, including works by Jean Picard. The Preface also states that at the time of Picard's death, Picard's collection of notes on dioptrics 'was in great confusion' and that the French mathematician and academician Laurent Pothenot oversaw their ordering and editing. This is likely the reason for their title: Les Fragmens de Dioptrique. Picard's extensive work with optical instruments in gnomics, astronomy, and surveying lead naturally to a keen interest in optics. The 77-page manuscript Pothernot worked on was a draft of Picard's text on dioptrics. It contained 49 propositions covering: refraction at spherical surfaces, focal characteristics of various types of lenses, and refraction at water, air, and glass interfaces. The text was based on presentations Picard had made to the French Academy in 1680.||Picard had carefully studies the optics of Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Barrow and wrote a summary of dioptrics expressly for applications to optical instruments.||This work on dioptrics by Picard would be printed again in 1730, pages 550-626 of volume 6, of the Memoires published by the French Academy that collected material from 1666 to its reorganization in 1699. It would appear again in 1736 in <i>Ouvrages de Mathematique de M. Picard<i>, a collection of astronomical and physical works of Picard.
","Collected papers on dioptrics presented by Picard to the French Academy of Sciences. The <i>Fragmens Dioptrique<i> presents 49 propositions and proofs on the geometrical optics of lenses; of convex and concave figure, of single and multiple arrangement, and in oculars. The text deals with the essential aspects of the geometrical optical aspects of dioptrics. Propositions 1-3 cover the fundamentals of refraction as curved interfaces. Propositions 4-16 establish the basic properties of lenses, giving the relationship between figure, curvature, focal distance, and image position and size for many types of spherically-figured lenses, for rays that are parallel and oblique to the optical axis. It is here that Picard gives his expression for spherical aberration. Propositions 17-24 solve various problems that relate curvature radii and conjugate focal points for various types of lenses. Picard obtains essentially the same result as Edmond Halley regarding thin lenses. Propositions 25-35 consider similar problems, but with lenses fully or partially immersed in water.  Propositions 36-44 consider oculars and their interaction with objective lenses. Propositions 45-49 consider the effects of refracted rays that reflect off the interior surfaces of a lens, and how this effects lens use, particularly in surveying.||The 49 propositions are proved or demonstrated with detailed geometric analysis. They are often accompanied by corollaries that extend the utility of the proposition, and in some cases 'rules' are given that summarize characteristics or can be used to guide the construction of a lens. The material is entirely mathematical; though Picard was very much a practitioner, no practical aspects regarding lens making are presented. A serious and careful student of Huygens, these papers mainly derived from Huygens' theories.

Francesco Algarotti,"Algarotti, Francesco",,1712-1764," ",Il Newtonianismo per le dame,"Six lively dialogues between Francesco Algarotti and a Marchioness on Newton's theories of light and color.","Finished after his trip to Paris and his stay with √âmilie du Ch√¢telet and Voltaire in 1735, Algarotti produced these six conversations with a fictional marchioness in which Newton's ideas and experiments on light and color are explained, questioned, and accepted. The complete embrace of Newtonianism was radical for the time, but the clarity, style, non-technical language, and form with which it was presented made the book important in the popularization of Newtonianism in Europe. This first edition--published without the usual permissions and with a forged title page--is interesting because its more radical aspects become more subdued in subsequent editions and translations; due, in part, to pressure from religious authorities. Algarotti began sketching the dialogues in the late 1720's and worked on them until the final edition of 1752. Algarotti write, in part, as a  response to Fontenelle's <i>Entretiens sur la pluralit√® des mondes<i> of 1686, which promoted Cartesian ideas using the format of a dialogue. Editions appeared in 1737, at Paris in 1738 and 1739, at London in 1739 and 1742, at Milan in 1739, at Amsterdam in 1741, at Naples in 1739 and 1752. A French translation appeared in 1738 and an English translation in 1739. The fame of the book was immediate and likely stoked by being placed on the Index of Forbidden Books for its radial promotion of socio-political change.
","Six lively dialogues between Francesco Algarotti (the narrator) and a Marchioness on Newton's theories of light and color. These include: A general idea of physics and hypotheses concerning light and color; Light and color as qualities, general principles of optics; vision and discoveries in optics and their use in refuting Descartes; experimental philosophy and Newton's system of optics; further exposition of Newton's optics; Newton's principle of attraction and its application in optics. At the conclusion, the Marchioness abandons Cartesianism for Newtonian ideas.","Science and Society: The Case of Acceptance of Newtonian Optics in the Eighteenth Century|Silva, C.C. and Moura, B.A.|<i>Science and Education<i>, Vol 21, No 9, 2012, pp 1317-1335.||Newton for ladies: gentility, gender and radical culture|Mazzotti, M.|<i>British Journal for the History of Science<i>, Vol 37, No 2, 2004, pp 119-146.||<i>Translating Italy for the Eighteenth Century: British Women, Translation and Travel Writing (1739-1797)<i>|Agorni, M.|Routlage, 2002, pp 71-79.||The Triumphal March of a Paradigm: A Case Study of the Popularization of Newtonian Science|Feh√©r, M.|<i>Tractrix<i>, Vol 2, 1990, pp 93-110.

The treatment is entirely Newtonian but, despite the title, is generally descriptive and geometric, not mathematical.

Rowning plumps for Newton, but states that he finds none of these ideas satisfying or plausible. Indeed, in his Preface, Rowning states he is unable to present a theory based on existing principles of natural philosophy that explain reflection of light and the basic luminous power of radiant surfaces. Regarding refraction, Rowning invokes attractive cohesion force to account for the bending of light rays.","The Problem of Reflection in Eighteenth-Century Projectile Theories of Light|Breno Arsioli Moura|<i>Physics in Perspective<i>, Vol 22, 2020, pp 191-214.","A compendious system of natural philosophy : With notes, containing the mathematical demonstrations, and some occasional remarks.

Appealing to the general development of natural philosophy in which one idea develops into and is superseded by another, and calling for a general amnesty regarding nationalism, he points out the value of Algarotti's work and its value to French readers. Nevertheless, the preface ends with the translator posing two objections to Newton's law of gravitational attraction that is the topic the last of Algarotti's dialogues. In the second edition of the <i>Il Newtonianismo per le Dame<i> published in Milan in 1739, Algarotti commented on this French translation, disapproving of the translator's counter-claim regarding the differing ends of philosophy and religion, and the translation's reduced role of sensory perception.

Voltaire had  contracted for publication in Amsterdam and tried for simultaneous publication in Paris. But French authorities denied approbation and so the Dutch publisher was left with three hundred printed pages of an unfinished book.  An anonymous mathematician was commissioned to complete one chapter and write two more and the book was published without Voltaire‚Äôs knowledge. Importantly, this first edition contained none of the metaphysics that underpinned Newtonian natural philosophy; that would be added by Voltaire in later editions. Voltaire had an edition published in Paris soon after the Amsterdam edition appeared, having wrangled a <i>permission tacite<i> from the authorities. It was, essentially, a reproduction of the Amsterdam edition. Subsequent editions appeared in London and Paris, but it was not until 1741 that an edition fully under Voltaire's control was published in Paris. It differed dramatically from the first. Among other changes, Voltaire added an entire introductory part, La metaphysique de Newton, eliminated some chapters, and added others. In subsequent editions Voltaire continued to make substantial alterations. Editions appears at Amsterdam in 1738; at Paris in 1738, 1741, 1744, 1745, 1751, and 1757; at Dresden in 1748; at Rouen in 1751; at Geneva in 1756, 1757, 1764, 1770, 1773, 1775. A few republications appeared after 1775, but these had not been revised by Voltaire. Translations in English appeared in 1738, in Germain in 1741, and in Italian in 1741. This copy contains both a portrait of Voltaire and an allegorical one of Newton.

Girolamo Fabrizio,"Fabrizio, Girolamo",Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente,1537-1619," ",Opera omnia anatomica & physiologica,"The collected works of Fabrizio, including <i>De Visione, Voce, Auditu<i> of 1600.
","Girolamo Fabrizio's  <i>De Visione, Voce, Auditu<i> of 1600 is one of the last significant perspectivist works, resting as it does on medieval theories of vision. Within 5 years Platter and Kepler would clarify the function of the components of the eye and in 20 years Scheiner would establish modern ocular anatomy. The collected works of Fabrizio were first edited by Johann Bohn and appeared in Leipzig in 1687. This later edition of 1738 was edited by Bernad Albin, and includes a biographical sketch of Fabrizio. It had been nearly 150 years since Frabrizio's work and its first appearance; only scholarly, not practical, interest can explain the re-editing and re-issuing.
","The collected works of Fabrizio, including <i>De Visione, Voce, Auditu<i> of 1600. Fabrizio held that one should describe Ô¨Årst the dissection and anatomy of a structure, then its independent action, and Ô¨Ånally its interdependent function in the body. That is, he aimed to discuss not just anatomy but physiology too. Thus the title: vision, voice, and hearing, rather than eye, larynx, and ear. The discussion of the eye and vision is entirely and completely medieval perspectivist. This involves: an upright image onto the crystalline lens, it being the seat of vision; perception based on geometric ideas originating at the beginning of perspectivism by Bacon, Alhacen, Witelo, and Peckham; the mechanisms of vision (lumen and lux) based on the Aristotelian idea of actualized potential qualities of materials. Only the anatomy presented is forward-looking and it presents a considerable advance, documented with exceptional plates of figures of the external anatomy of the eye. Some of these are reused by Platter and again by Kepler.","‚ÅÇ Hieronymus Fabricius d'Aquapendente : De visione, Ending of the Perspectivistic Tradition|De Nil, E. ,De Mey, M.|In: <i>Optics and Astronomy: Proceedings of the XXth International Congress of History of Science<i>|Brepols Publishers, 2001, pp 51-81.||Hieronymous Fabricius Ab Acquapendente (1533‚Äì1619)|Smith, S.B., Macchi, V., Parenti, A., DeCaro, R.|<i>Clinical Anatomy<i>, Vol 17, No 4, 2004, pp 540-543.","Hieronymi Fabricii ab Aquapendente, Philosophi ac Medici, inque Florenttissimo Gymnasio Patavino Anatomes ac Chirurgiae Professoris Publici, singularis & supraordinarii, Opera omnia anatomica & physiologica, Hactenus variis locis ac formis edita : nunc vero certo ordine digesta, & in unum Volumen redacta.

Benjamin Martin,"Martin, Benjamin",,1704-1782," ",The philosophical grammar,"The second, expanded edition of an epitome of natural philosophy, principally from the physical sciences, written for students and self-study.
","Martin's first published book, written while he was running a boarding school and teaching everything from Writing to Astronomy. As with most of his work, he wrote books not meant to be texts, ancillary to and used in a formal course, rather he wrote for the autodidact: 'for those whose lot it is to pursue these studies without a master.' The <i>Philosophical Grammar<i> was his most successful book. The English original appeared in 1735, the second in 1738 with expanded text and additional plates. Eight editions appeared up to 1778, all printed essentially unchanged from the second. It was popular not only in England but in continental Europe. It was translated into Dutch with three editions, French with editions in 1749, 1764, and 1769, German in 1779, and Italian with editions at Venice and Naples in 1750, 1753, 1760, 1769, 1771, 1778, and 1807. Posthumous editions appeared in Greek and Russian. The text is interesting in that it is structured in two levels: the main dialogue in which the material is briefly presented, and copious notes that give detail, add mathematics, and explain the figures. In this way the book can be read at two levels; reading only the dialogue gives the overview, while the notes give the details and more advanced material.
","The second, expanded edition of an epitome of knowledge, principally from the physical sciences, written for students and self-study. The wide range of topics were meant to provide a survey of most of natural philosophy. The material is prefaced with a general introduction to experimentation, natural philosophy, and a list of instruments and their uses. Part I: Nature and properties of matter, Newtonian physics and mechanics. Part II: Cosmology, including the planets, the moon, the stars, and comets. Part III: 'Aerology', including the atmosphere and meteorics. Part IV: Geology, plants, insects, birds, and animals. Part I contains chapters on light and color (25 pages), including: nature of light, reflection, refraction, simple mirrors and lenses, the microscope, telescope, camera obscura, the magic lantern, prismatic and thin-plate colors, heterogeneous white light. The presentation is elementary, with no mathematics, in the form of a dialogue of short questions and answers. Accompanying the dialogue is an elaborate and copious set of notes that give examples, clarify, cite authorities, and explain the figures. The details and more advanced material is in the notes.

Only later did it become generally know that he had produced the book. A pirated edition, again without Passemant's name, appeared in Amsterdam in 1741 and is the version which circulated more widely and was the most influential, triggering as it did the development of reflecting telescope making in the Netherlands. The book was specifically written for those 'who want to construct a telescope of their own.' The plate of figures was drawn and etched by J.B. Scotin.||Though Newton had demonstrated his reflecting telescope in 1668, metal mirrors were difficult to make, figure, polish, and keep from tarnishing. It was only in the 1720s and 1730s that this craft advanced enough for the construction of practical instruments. Passemant's book appeared the same year as Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i>. Though both texts detail the development of telescope optics, Passemant's book contains details regarding the making of telescope mirrors that only a practitioner could present.

Robert Smith,"Smith, Robert",,1689-1768," ",A compleat system of opticks,"A thorough treatment of the science of optics in the form of a textbook. Among the greatest in the 18th century.
","Smith's text is clearly designed for teaching; it's content, scope, clarity, style, and concision reflect his ideas of what optics was and how it should be presented in full. Smith held optics to be a mathematical science and presented what he felt to be its core: light's behavior, optical materials, mirrors and lenses, and optical instruments. Next in importance was perception, hence the emphasis on images and the inclusion of Jurin's essay on vision. To help produce a coherent whole, sections of Newton's <i>Opticks<i> were extracted and refashioned, anchoring many of the sections in Books I and II, together with Smith's original material on geometrical optics. Coherence and clarity also demanded that details, mathematics, notes, sidelines, and alternatives ideas not interrupt the general presentation; thus their gathering in the section 'Author's Remarks' at the conclusion of the work. Smith's work became the principal textbook of optics in the 18th century and was read and used into the 19th. It was the greatest among the few English texts in the 18th century devoted solely to optics, the list of such texts is short: Smith in 1738, Benjamin Martin in 1740 and 1758, William Emerson in 1768, Harris posthumously in 1775, Higgins in 1776, and Woods in 1799.Montucla, Helmholtz, Mach, and Schmidt all cited Smith's <i>System<i>. Dutch editions appeared in 1753 and 1764, German in 1755 and 1775, and expanded French editions in 1767 and 1783. An English precis was produced in 1778 for use at Cambridge. 
","A thorough treatment of the science and mathematics of optics in the form of a textbook. Four treatises and additional remarks. Book I, A Popular Treatise, sets out Newton's natural philosophy of optics, including: nature of light, lenses and spectacles, vision, colors and differing refraction, the cause of reflection, refraction, and diffraction, color and optical properties of materials. Book II, A Mathematical Treatise, contains geometrical optics, including: foci and images from mirrors, the foci and images from lenses, analysis of multiple lenses, lens aberrations, the reflecting telescope, images from telescopes and microscopes. Book III, A Mechanical Treatise, is on optical instruments, including: lens grinding (Huygens' method reported by Molyneux), telescope sights, meridian sectors, mural arcs, image projectors, binoculars, telescope mirrors, mechanics of microscopes. Book IV, A Philosophical Treatise, give a history of discoveries made with the telescope. The fifth part, Author's Remarks, adds experimental details, elaborations, alternative ideas, and mathematical proofs to sections of the four Books. Jurin's essay on vision appears at the end. Book I is meant for a general audience and so demonstrations are not mathematical but rather experimental. In the other books the presentation is detailed, mathematical, and accompanied by hundreds of detailed figures. The text is the first in English on optical design and includes the first statement of the 'optical invariant' for lenses (product of image size and ray angle), first illustrations of spherical aberrations and caustics, and the introduction of marginal rays in lens analysis.","‚ÅÇ  Reading up on the Optics.

Christian Wolff,"Wolff, Christian",Christian Freiherr von Wolff,1679-1753,Translated by Johann Christoffel von Sprogel (1686-?) German phycian living in Amsterdam.,Grond-beginzelen van alle de mathematische weetenschappen,"First Dutch translation of Wolff's <i>Der Anfangs-GruÃànde<i> of 1710. It was the first introductory teaching compendium in German on Mixed Mathematics.
","Wolff and his writings were unknow in the Netherlands before the appearance of this translation. The translator, Christoffel von Spr√∂gel, was a German physician who moved to Amsterdam in 1736 and announced a series of lectures on Wolffian philosophy. Apparently, the response was sufficient to warrant a large translation project and working with another translator, Adolf Fredrick Marci, of Wolff's German (not Latin) works were translated into Dutch. The <i>Der Anfangs-GruÃànde<i> of 1710 was the first in this project. von Spr√∂gel states that he had studied mathematics since his youth and had come to hold that Wolff had written the best textbook on the subject and wanted the Dutch public to have access to his works. A second printing of this translation appeared in 1758.
","First Dutch translation of Wolff's <i>Der Anfangs-GruÃànde<i> of 1710. It was the first introductory teaching compendium in German on Mixed Mathematics. Four volumes containing: I arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry and architecture; II artillery, fortification, mechanics, hydrostatics, aerometry, and Hydraulics; III optics, spherical trigonometry, astronomy, chronology, geography, and horology; IV rudiments of algebra and the differential and integral calculus. The optics section (118 pages) includes: optics, with a euclidean-geometrical explanation of perception; making and figuring glass and metal mirrors; burning mirrors and images from mirrors; mirrors for anamorphosis; refraction, lenses and their focal and imagining properties; making and use of microscopes and telescopes; magic lanterns. The treatment is practical and geometric, with the dioptrics receiving a more extensive and mathematical treatment.  The presentation is formal and very concise, with axioms, theorems and their demonstration, and comments in scholia introducing most material. Examples by way of problems are presented and solved. The optics material draws heavily from Dechales, Huygens, and Zahn. Newton's color theory is described, though Wolff freighted it with a mediumistic/mechanical basis.","Leibniz and Wolff in the Netherlands.

Francesco Algarotti,"Algarotti, Francesco",,1712-1764,Translated by Elizabeth Carter (1717-1806) Friend of Samuel Johnson and member of the Bluestocking Society,Newton's Philosophy for the Ladies,"Elizabeth Carter's English translation of the <i>Il Newtonianismo per le dame<i> of 1737.
","Elizabeth Carter's translation of Algarotti's <i>Il Newtonianismo per le Dame<i> gives evidence of her interest in and understanding of mathematics and astronomy. Her translation shows specialist knowledge of Newtonian ideas and is remarkable for footnotes that quote extensively from literary and scientific sources, including Pierre Bayle's General Dictionary. Carter's translation is not a rote one; she adopted strategies for altering Algarotti's text to make it more narrowly focused on the science it contained. She either smoothed over or eliminated the erotic or misogynistic portions of Algarotti's text and also eliminated many of the specific references to socio-political change in what was then known as 'Italy'. In these way, the English version of Algarotti was considerably different than the Italian. In the second edition of the <i>Il Newtonianismo per le Dame<i> published in Milan in 1739, Algarotti commented on this English translation, wishing it had been more faithful to the original--likely an objection to Carter's strategic changes. Editions of the translation appeared in London in 1739, 1742, 1772 and Glasgow in 1765. 
","English translation of the <i>Il Newtonianismo per le Dame<i> of 1737. Six lively dialogues between Francesco Algarotti (the narrator) and a Marchioness on Newton's theories of light and color. These include: A general idea of physics and hypotheses concerning light and color; Light and color as qualities, general principles of optics; vision and discoveries in optics and their use in refuting Descartes; experimental philosophy and Newton's system of optics; further exposition of Newton's optics; Newton's principle of attraction and its application in optics. At the conclusion, the Marchioness abandons Cartesianism for Newtonian ideas.","<i>Translating Italy for the Eighteenth Century: British Women, Translation and Travel Writing (1739-1797)<i>|Agorni, M.|Routlage, 2002, pp 56-89.||Science and Society: The Case of Acceptance of Newtonian Optics in the Eighteenth Century|Silva, C.C. and Moura, B.A.|<i>Science and Education<i>, Vol 21, No 9, 2012, pp 1317-1335.||Newton for ladies: gentility, gender and radical culture|Mazzotti, M.|<i>British Journal for the History of Science<i>, Vol 37, No 2, 2004, pp 119-146.",Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy Explain'd for the use of the Ladies In six Diaglgoues on Light and Colours.

","Banieres' <i>Examen et reÃÅfutation<i> is as much an attack on Newtonians as it is Voltaire. Banieres was an ardent Cartesian and had published his <i>Trait√© physique, de la lumiere et des couleurs<i> in 1738 and drew heavily from it for the  <i>Examen et reÃÅfutation<i>. By the 1740s, Cartesian ideas involving vortices and the plenum had been abandoned by many, so Banieres'  <i>Examen et reÃÅfutation<i> had little influence, other than to be the hallmark of the end of Cartesianism. The <i>Examen et reÃÅfutation<i> received a blistering review in the History of the Works of the Learned of February 1740.
","A chapter-by-chapter refutation of the first 14 chapters of Voltaire's <i>Elemens<i> of 1738; that is, that portion dealing with Newton's optics. Banieres opens with a preface of 96 pages on the causes and laws of the reflection and refraction of light. He cites works of Hobbes, Mairan, John Bernoulli, and Descartes to show alternatives to Newton's ideas, to refute was Voltaire presented, to show the fallacies regarding forces of attraction, to champion the fundamentally mechanistic ideas of Descartes, and to show that Cartesian ideas regarding reflection and refraction are uppermost. Subject include: light's nature and propagation; reflection; visual perception; refraction; chromatic refraction; cause of refraction; light particles and their colors; the rainbow; the analogy between colors and musical tones.","Eighteenth century optics: the Cartesian-Newtonian Conflict|Pav, P.A.|<i>Applied Optics<i>, Vol 14, No 12, 1975, pp 3102-3108.","Examen et reÃÅfutation des EÃÅleÃÅmens de la philosophie de Neuton de M. de Voltaire , avec une dissertation sur la reÃÅflexion et la reÃÅfraction de la lumieÃÄre.

","From 1711 until his death in 1738, Richard Helsham taught natural philosophy at the new medical school at Trinity College Dublin. Helsham's pupil, Bryan Robinson, was also a medical doctor, had attended Helsham's lectures, and used the lecture notes to produce a teaching textbook for natural philosophy. Robinson's editorial work included adding a Preface that quotes Newton's method for natural philosophy which is taken from the <i>Opticks<i> of 1704, and adding an Appendix that brought mathematical detail to some of Helsham's articles. Helsham adheres closely to Newtonian science, specifically mechanics and its applications, and optics. The text does not cover heat, electricity, or magnetism--topics not found in Newton's Principia or Opticks.||The text became widely used and was in print for nearly a century, with the content remaining unchanged until the late editions. Editions appeared London in 1739, 1743, 1755, 1767, 1767, and 1777, at Dublin in 1739, 1778, 1793, and 1822, and at Philadelphia in 1802. A Latin translation appeared at Vienna in 1769. Several excerpts were also produced in the 19th century.
","Helsham's textbook is in 23 Lectures. Lectures 1-11 cover forces, motion, and mechanics. Lectures 12-14 cover hydrostatics. Lectures 15-18 cover pneumatics and sound. Lectures 19-23 cover optics. The optics material (70 pages) Lecture 19 includes physical optics, the nature of light, reflection and refraction, and refractive properties of solids and liquids. Lecture 20 cover colors and relies heavily on Newton Opticks. Prismatic colors and colors produced by selected liquids is covered. Lecture 21 covers dioptrics including lenses and basic geometric optics. Lecture 22 covers the eye, eye function, vision, spectacles, and perception. Lecture 23 covers catoptrics including plane and both convex and concave spherical mirrors, and the calculation, size, and place of images.||Helsham's treatments are thorough, essentially descriptive, and particularly clear. The mathematics uses the geometry of ratios integrated into the text and never rises above that--though it is made to serve remarkably well in many cases. Robinson's Appendix adds considerable algebraic mathematics to many subjects, particularly enhancing and expanding the material of geometric optics. The concision and descriptive nature of the text makes the plates of figures an essential part of material.","‚ÅÇ A Course of Lectures in Natural Philosophy|Roche, J.|<i>European Journal of Physics<i>, Vol 21, No 3, 2000, pp 275-277.","A course of lectures in natural philosophy.

"Louis-Bertrand  Castel, SJ","Castel, Louis-Bertrand  SJ",,1688-1757," ",L'optique des couleurs,"A general development of color theory applied to painting, perception, and sound.","The most famous work of Louis Bertrand Castel, presenting his theories of color; their nature, origin, and relationships to sound, brought together in his description of the 'ocular harpsichord.' In 1735 Castel wrote a series of articles for the Journal de Trevoux on new experiments in optics and acoustics. The <i>L‚ÄôOptique des couleurs<i> is an elaboration and explanation of those ideas. A firm Anti-Newtonian, Castel opposed virtually all of the new natural philosophy and his though can be considered the result of  grafting Cartesianism onto scholasticism. Widely read, the book received blistering reviews in the scientific press but the idea of an instrument that simultaneously presented sounds and their 'matching' colors appealed to many outside of such circles. Popularizing the idea of such an instrument was the only influence the book had; its color theory far too antiquarian to be considered seriously.
","A general development of color theory applied to painting, perception, and sound. It presents: general consideration of color, separating artificial prismatic colors from the real colors of pigments and objects; white and black as the origin of colors; chromatic harmony and its basis in the 'primitive colors' of nature; specific shades of blue, red, and yellow as primitive colors; color circles, their application in art, and their relationship to musical scales; derivation of 144 true, real colors and their relation to the musical scale; previous letters giving several negative assessments of Newton's theory of colors; and the ocular harpsichord. The development is descriptive, no mathematics is involved, and the basis is a hybrid of scholasticism and Cartesianism.","‚ÅÇ  <i>Louis-Bertrand Castel, Anti-Newtonian Scientist<i>|Schier, D.S.|Torch Press, 1941.","L'optique des couleurs, FondeÃÅe sur les simples observations, & tourneÃÅe sur-tout aÃÄ la pratique de la peinture, de la teinture & des autres arts coloristes.

Benjamin Martin,"Martin, Benjamin",,1704-1782," ",A new and compendious system of optics,"A compendium of practical optics, in three parts: Catoptrics, Dioptrics, and Optical Instruments.","This is Martin's first original contribution to natural philosophy. Though Martin was widely read and drew on other works, this is largely based on his own experience. He justifies the need for his optics text book by noting that Molyneux's book 'was too large, and too much perplexed with algebraic solutions', while in Gregory's <i>Elements<i>, 'the geometrical demonstrations of every proposition deter the reader,' and Browne's Supplement to Gregory's book was 'a labyrinth of analytical investigations and solutions,' and Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> too expensive. Martin was both a teacher and instrument maker, and his optics compendium bears the stamp of experience in each. The book is written with the very practical outcome of optical instruments in mind, and the concision, clarity of presentation, and use of detailed figures shows it to be specifically written for self-study. It was one of the few English texts in the 18th century devoted solely to optics; the list of such texts being short: Smith in 1738, Benjamin Martin in 1740 and 1758, William Emerson in 1768, Harris posthumously in 1775, Higgins in 1776, and Woods in 1799.
","A compendium of practical optics, in three parts: Catoptrics, Dioptrics, and Optical Instruments. Catoptrics (56 pages) includes: definitions, rays and pencils of rays, reflection, plane and spherical convex and concave mirrors, the analysis of mirror foci and images, 'rules' for catoptrics derived from the analysis. Dioptrics (84 pages) includes: refraction at plane and curved interfaces, foci and images from lenses, analysis of lens images, 'rules' for the analysis of lenses. Optical Instruments (155 pages) describes mainly dioptric apparatus and includes: ocular anatomy, eye-function, and vision; spectacles and vision correction; camera obscura; microscopes, simple and compound; telescopes; colors and differing refraction, chromatic aberration; reflecting telescopes; micrometers; optical goniometer; magic lantern and binoculars. The presentation is practical with no laboring over theory, very detailed, and with an emphasis on experiments leading to 'rules', and those leading to practical optical instruments. Just enough mathematics is introduced to provide for practical computations. Much of Martin's material came from practical experience--he was a successful oculist and his instruments were commercially successful.","‚ÅÇ <i>Benjamin Martin: Author, Instrument-Maker, and ‚ÄòCountry Showman‚Äô<i>|Millburn, J.R.|Nordhoff Publishing, Lyden, 1976, pp 28-30.||Benjamin Martin (1704-1782) and his Writings on the Eye and Eyeglasses|Goss, D.A.|<i>Hindsight, Journal of Optometry History<i>, Vol 41, No 2, pp 41-55.","A new and compendious system of optics.

Isaac Newton,"Newton, Isaac",,1642-1727,"Translated by Samuel Clarke (1675-1729) English philosopher and cleric, correspondent, translator.",Optice,"The Third edition of the <i>Optice<i> of 1706. This edition contains all the queries of the final English edition
","This is part of a hybrid set of, in all, 8 volumes of the first collected works of Isaac Newton. Published between 1739-1761 it consists of 'Geneva Principia' , 3 vols. (1739-42), Optice (1740), and <i>Arithmatica Universalis<i> (1761). This edition of the <i>Optice<i> contains a portrait of Newton made in 1728 when he was 84. The allegorical title vignette was drawn by Delamoncien and engraved by Jean-Louis Daud√©t. The Latin of Samuel Clarke was edited by Marcus-Michael Bousquet who dedicated it to Johannes Bernoulli.
","The third edition of the <i>Optice<i> of 1706. This edition contains all the queries of the final English edition. Like the <i>Opticks<i>, the <i>Optice<i> is in three Books. Book I is in two parts. Part I deals with prism experiments and the spectral heterogeneity of white light. It begins with definitions and axioms that review the basic aspects of geometric optics of reflection and refraction. This is followed by 8 propositions based on 16 experiments dealing with chromatic inhomogeneity and its consequences. Propositions 7 and 8 deal specifically with the limitations imposed on telescope objectives by what is now called chromatic aberration. Part II presents 11 propositions based on 17 experiments investigating the nature of color and the application of the theory of chromatic heterogeneity, particularly to the rainbow. It is here that Newton's 'experimentum crucis' of his letter of 1672 is presented in refined form and great detail.||Book II is in four parts. Part I presents 24 observations of the colored fringes produced by light passing through glass plates and thin lenses in contact in air and water. Part II presents a mathematical analysis of these observations, including Newton's method for determining small separating distances. Part III presents 20 propositions dealing with colors of natural bodies and their relationship to prismatic colors and color production in thin plates. it is here that Newton proposes that light has 'Fits of easy reflection and fits of easy transmission.' Part IV presents 13 observations of colors produced by thick plates.||Book III presents 11 descriptive observations of the color and placement of diffraction fringes produced by various objects. Queries--rhetorical questions--were Newton's means of proposing ideas about natural philosophy in general and the nature of light and color in particular. It is here that Newton dismisses wave theories of light as incapable of explaining its observed properties.  The <i>Optice<i> ends with the original 16 Queries of the <i>Opticks<i>, adds 7 new ones, and adds extensively to Queries 10 and 11. The <i>Optice<i> also provides an addendum describing luminescent light sources. Queries  17-23 are new in the <i>Optice<i> and deal with the nature of space, the plenum, the aether, and luminous corpuscles. Newton makes reference to Hauksbee's mercurial light and, ever-skeptical of Huygens' wave theory of light, adds an explanation for double refraction of certain crystals; an explanation based the corpuscular assumption of the nature of light. Query 23 is the longest and most important of all, by far, pondering the existence gravitational, magnetic, and electrical forces by which bodies can produce action-at-a-distance. He argues why these cannot be dismissed as 'occult forces' and suggest that other, more powerful forces may exist that are responsible for the interaction of light and matter. It ends with Newton's remarkable paragraph linking the development of natural and moral philosophy.","Les Queries de l'Optique|Koyre, A.|<i>Archieves Internationales d'Histoire des Sciences<i>, Vol 13, 1960, pp 15-29.||The methodological origins of Newton‚Äôs queries|Anstey, P.R.|<i>Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science<i>, Vol 35, 2004, pp 247-269.||Sir Isaac and the ingenious Mr. Hauksbee|Guerlac, H.|In: <i>M√©langes Alexandre Koyr√©: L'aventure de la science<i>|Hermann, Paris, 1964, pp 228-253, NB 250-253.","Optice: sive de reflexionibus, refractionibus, inflexionibus et coloribus lucis, libri tres.

"Louis-Bertrand Castel, SJ","Castel, Louis-Bertrand SJ",,1688-1757," ",Le vrai systeÃÄme de physique,"An analysis and general refutation of Newtonianism ","Ten years before the appearance of <i>Le Vrais System de Physique<i>, Castel announced in the Journal de Trevoux his plans to publish a work on Newtonian physics. Having read the <i>Principia<i> and the <i>Optice<i>, Castel admired Newton's mathematical ability but rejects his experimental method and resulting physics in favor of Descartes‚Äôs. The essential problem was Newton's attractive force, operating at a distance: it was without mechanism. Thus, Castel rejected Newton's conception of gravity and all those aspects of the optics which seemed to depend on this; that is, reflection, refraction, and prismatic color. Though the title implies a comparison between the ideas of Newton and Descartes, after the first of the nine analyses, Castel provides only refutations of Newton. The reception of the book was tepid, most reviewers feeling that Castel's Newtonian refutations were unconvincing and the system he offered in its place was too dependent on extending and rationalizing simple direct observations, and insufficiently grounded in experiment.
","An analysis and general refutation of Newtonianism in nine analyses. These involve: comparison of Descartes's and Newton's mechanics; preparatory explanation and discussion of geometry, mechanics, and physics; Descartes's theory of vortices; refutation of Newton's analysis of vortices; criticism of Newton's experimental method of natural philosophy; Castel's method of observation, comparison, and analogy; and the superiority of a rationalistic method of investigation over the experimental. The optics section (100 pages) includes: nature of light according to Descartes and Newton; propagation of light; emission and mediumistic theories; the strength of Descartes's rational system and the weakness of Newton's experimental and inferential system; color according to Newton; problems both conceptual and experimental with the use of prisms; Grimaldi's diffraction opposing the emission theory; Castel's theory of color. Castel's objections to Newton's theory of color rest the mistrust of instruments (such as the prism) in experiments, and the use of abstraction and mathematics to build a theoretical system from the results.","‚ÅÇ  <i>Louis-Bertrand Castel, Anti-Newtonian Scientist<i>|Schier, D.S.|Torch Press, 1941.","Le vrai systeÃÄme de physique geÃÅneÃÅrale de M.

Alexis Claude Clairaut,"Clairaut, Alexis Claude",,1713-1765," ",Histoire de L'Academie Royal des Sciences,"A comparison of de Mairan's neo-Cartesian explanation of refraction and a Newtonian one based on light particles and attractive force.","In 1739 Alexis Claude Clairaut read a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences comparing Cartesian and Newtonian explanations of refraction. The paper appeared in 1743 when the annual memoires of the academy were printed. This was the first of several investigations by French Newtonians (d'Alembert, Courtivron, and Maupertuis) that invoked Newton's light corpuscles and the force of attraction to explain refraction and show alignment with the sine law refraction. It is likely that this paper was to refute one presented a year earlier by Jean-Jacques Dortous de Mairan that presented a so-called neo-Cartesian explanation of refraction. Clairaut‚Äôs paper marked the beginning of the end of French adherence to Cartesian optics.","An examination and comparison of de Mairan's neo-Cartesian explanation of refraction, and a Newtonian one based on light particles and attractive force. The fundamentally mechanical nature of the neo-Cartesian explanation, based on a medium's resistance to light propagation, is rejected. James Bradley's discovery of stellar aberration is presented a proof of light's corpuscular nature. Particles and attractive force is then used not only to explain reflection and refraction, but also to present a simplified derivation of the sine law of refraction. Clairaut uses Leibniz's reformulation of Newton's mechanics and his calculus.","<i>A History of Optics from Greek Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century<i>|Darrigol, O.|Oxford, 2012, pp 124-125.","Clairaut ""Sur les Explications Cartesienne et Newtonienne de la Refraction de la lumiere""  In: Suite Des Memoires De Mathematique et de Physique; Tires des Registres de L'Academie Royale des Sciences. 1739. p 350-373.",On Cartesian and Newtonian Explanations of the Refraction of Light,,1743,1725-1750,"French mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher.

Regnault, an adherent of Descartes, held that the core of 'modern physics' (that is, Cartesianism) arose from the Greeks. Though familiar with Newton's work, Regnault mentions it only to refute it. The material describing and dismissing Newtonian ideas is unchanged from the editions of 1729. The text reflects the idea that physics was the study of nature and that investigators discovered new marvels and mysteries and did not construct systems of explanation. This is in alignment with the refusal to invoke any mathematics, it being held that even geometry gets in the way of understanding. The entire impression is a work left behind by the advance of Newtonianism in France, one that is both marker and evidence of fading Cartesianism. Editions appeared at Paris in 1729, 1729, 1732, 1733, 1737, 1743, 1745, and 1755, at Amsterdam in 1732, an English translation appeared in 1731, an Italian translation at Venice in 1736, 1740, and 1749, and an Italian abridgement at Venice in 1751.

","In Book three of the <i>Opticks<i>, Newton suggested the existence of an active, springy, non-material aether that is the cause of optical refraction. Robinson proports to prove that the presumed infinite, universal aether accounts for the attractive, repulsive, cohesive forces observed in nature (reflection, refraction, gravity, etc.). The treatment is haphazard, if not sophistical, with carefully extracted quotations and plausible mathematics used to in an attempt to prove the points.","<i>Mechanism and Materialism: British Natural Philosophy in An Age of Reason<i>|Schofield, R.E.|Princeton University Press, 1970, pp 89-115.||<i>Conceptions of Ether.

Working with others he discovered a large number of common substances that were luminescent. The results of experiments to determine their properties appeared in a series of papers appearing in the Commentarii de Bononensi, the journal of the Bologna Institute of the Sciences and Arts between 1731 and 1747. These formed the basis for two book-length essays appearing in 1744 and 1747. This is the first. They were translated into English in 1776.
","The work begins with a conspectus of all types of luminescence, including bioluminescence and luminescence caused by putrefaction. The a description of the many types of luminescent materials that emit light by excitation. Excitation by attrition, heat, admission of air ('barometric light'), and exposure to external light. This is essentially the modern classification of luminescence by excitation. Most of the work deals with the last type of excitation: what is now called photoluminescence. Experiments and equipment are described to determine the color, intensity, and duration of luminescence based the length and intensity of the excitation.

Regnault, an adherent of Descartes, held that the core of 'modern physics' (that is, Cartesianism) arose from the Greeks. Though familiar with Newton's work, Regnault mentions it only to refute it. This edition was prompted by the appearance of Voltaire's <i>Elemens<i> and Regnault specifically mentions it for what he considers its absurdity. The material describing and dismissing Newtonian ideas is unchanged from the editions of 1729. The text reflects the idea that physics was the study of nature and that investigators discovered new marvels and mysteries and did not construct systems of explanation. This is in alignment with the refusal to invoke any mathematics, it being held that even geometry gets in the way of understanding. The entire impression is a work left behind by the advance of Newtonianism in France, one that is both marker and evidence of fading Cartesianism. Editions appeared at Paris in 1729, 1729, 1732, 1733, 1737, 1743, 1745, and 1755, at Amsterdam in 1732, an English translation appeared in 1731, an Italian translation at Venice in 1736, 1740, and 1749, and an Italian abridgement at Venice in 1751.
","Much of volume three is devoted to optics (179 pages). The dialogues are usually accompanied by propositions and their proofs. The material includes: the nature and propagation of light; transparent materials; phosphors; vision; example optical problems and their solution; mirrors, lenses, and burning glasses; Color, Descartes's and Newton's theory; other color theories (Malebranche); changing colors. The presentation is elementary and descriptive, no mathematics is used.","Le Cartesianisme Chez les Jesuites Francais: au XVIIth et au XVIIIth Siecle|Sortais, G.|<i>Archives de Philosophie<i>, Vol 6, No 3, 1929, pp 1-10.","Les Entretiens physiques d'Ariste et d'Eudoxe, ou, Physique nouvelle en dialogues : qui renferme preÃÅciseÃÅment ce qui s'est deÃÅcouvert de plus curieux & de plus utile dans la nature.

","Elie de Joncourt produced this French translation from the 1742 edition of the <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i>. It marks the considerable advance of Newtonianism over Cartesianism in France and the market for Newtonian texts. The latest editions of Voltaire's <i>Elemens de la philosophie de Neuton<i> had appeared in 1742, but it was an introduction; neither written for nor appropriate as a textbook. The preface to the first edition of the <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> dated 1719 and the unfinished preface to the 1742 edition are included in the translation. The engravings of the 1742 Latin edition were used to print the plates for this translated edition. Editions of the French translation appeared at Leiden in 1745 and 1746, and at Paris in 1747. Elie de Joncourt also produced a French translation of Pemberton's <i>A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy<i> in 1755.
","A handbook of physics covering: statics; dynamics; gravity; fluids; fire, heat, light, and electro-luminescence; optics; system of the world; and celestial motion.

Abb√© Jean-Antoine Nollet,"Nollet, Abb√© Jean-Antoine",,1700-1770," ",Le√ßons de Physique,"Explanatory text to accompany a course of lectures in physics.","Nollet was the leading experimental physicist for thirty years in mid-eighteenth-century France. His course of lectures, aimed at upper-class Parisian society, was accompanied by elaborate, if not spectacular, demonstrations of physical principles and the use of experimental apparatus. This was the source for the <i>Le√ßons de Physique<i>, which became as famous as the course itself and was the first step in establishing experimental physics in France. Nollet's work expressed in the <i>Le√ßons de Physique<i> led to a reorientation of physics teaching in French universities and was the model for a new generation of French physics textbooks, replacing those of Poliniere and Rohault. Though Nollet's physics was experimental, it was not, inherently, mathematical. He considered algebra and geometry helpful, but not essential.  The <i>Le√ßons de Physique<i> also had considerable influence outside France: in Italy, Spain, and Germany. Editions appeared at Paris 1743, 1745, 1749, 1754, 1759, 1764, 1767, 1771, 1775, 1783; at Amsterdam 1745, 1754,  and 1765;  in an Italian translation at Venice in 1746, 1751, and 1759; in a German translation at Erfurt in 1749; and in a Spanish translation at Madrid in 1757.
","Explanatory text to accompany a course of lectures in physics. The material covered includes: material bodies and their properties; simple and compound motion under central forces; gravity; hydrostatics; mechanics; nature and properties of air; nature and properties of water; nature and properties of fire; light and optics; stars and their movement; magnetism; electricity. All of tome five is devoted to optics (579 pages).  It includes: the nature, properties, and propagation of light; catoptrics, plane and spherical mirrors and their images; dioptrics, refraction, lenses and their images; color and differing refraction; vision, the eye, eye-function; spectacles, microscopes, telescopes, and the magic lantern. Nollet used large sections of Newton's Optice dealing with prismatic colors, the heterogeneity of white light, and differing refrangibility. Nollet did not accept the corpuscular theory of light proposed in Newton's Queries, presenting instead a modified form of Descartes' ideas. Forty-one experiments are described in the text, demonstrating each principal idea. The presentation is detailed, geometric, and accompanied by detailed figures.

Leonhard Euler,"Euler, Leonhard",,1707-1783," ",Nova Theoria Lucis et Colorum,"A theory of light based on propagating pulses in an aethereal medium. Considered the only complete wave theory of light until Fresnel's in the 19th century.
","Leonhard Euler's theory of light and color was the first complete wave theory of light that accounted for propagation, reflection, refraction, dispersion, and color. Based on the analogy between light and sound, light was presented as a series of pulses in an aethereal medium, with different spaces between pulses (different frequencies) associated with different colors. Unlike the earlier theories of Descartes, Huygens, Malebranche, Bernoulli, and Mairan, that of Euler is complete and attempts to explain most, if not all, optical phenomena. As such, it was the first full alternative to the various emission theories of light and color, and initiated the 18th century debate on the nature of light. Lambert, for example, in his <i>Photometria<i> of 1760, compares Newton's theory and Euler's theory. Euler's <i>Nova Theoria<i> introduced the idea of frequency as fundamental aspect of light and which would be a permanent contribution to the ongoing development of the mediumistic theory of light.
","A theory of light presented in five chapters. Chapter 1: an extensive consideration, comparison, and evaluation of the emission and mediumistic theories of light's nature. Only mechanical theories (emitted particles or disturbances in a medium) are considered; action-at-a-distance is dismissed entirely. The analogy between sound and light is considered and three objections to the emission theory are considered: loss of mass, non-interference of intersecting light rays, and the problem of explaining transparency. The result is a rejection of emission theories. Chapter 2: the mathematics of the formation and propagation of pulses in an aetherial medium. Chapter 3: the succession of pulses and rays of light and the transition to a wave theory.  As with sound where high and low tones are caused by differing pulse frequencies, light of differing pulse frequencies gives rise to differing colors. Chapter 4: reflection and refraction of rays, dispersion, and the composition of white light. Chapter 5: luminous, reflecting, refracting, and opaque bodies.","‚ÅÇ <i>Optics in the Age of Euler: Conceptions of the Nature of Light, 1700-1795<i>|Hakfoot, C.|Cambridge University Press, 1995, 243 pp.||Leonhard Euler's Wave Theory of Light|Pdeersen, K.M.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 16, No 4, 2008, pp 392-416.",Nova Theoria Lucis et Colorum.

"Girolamo Ferrari, OFM","Ferrari, Girolamo OFM",Forutnato da Brescia,1701-1754," ",Philosophia Sensuum Mechanica,"An expanded teaching manual covering General and Particular Physics.","Second, expanded edition of the work of 1735. The first edition was in two volumes, this edition is in four volumes. A textbook describing 'those things which are observed by the senses.' By the time Ferrari wrote this, his thinking had evolved away from Scholastic Aristotelianism and had aligned with the natural philosophy of Gassendi, parts of Descartes and Malebranche, and the optics (but not the gravity) of Newton. In many sections, particularly those on optics and the physics of light, a summary history is given ranging from the ideas of Epicurus and Aristotle, through Descartes and Malebranche, to Huygens and Newton. The textbook shows that though Ferrari had moved away from most of the physics of Descartes and presents that of Newton, he continued to assume a fundamental mechanistic basis of physics and was unwilling to grant that (merely) the predictive accuracy of Newton's equation was evidence of the reality that was hypothesized to underlie them. In this sense, Ferrari's text is an example of the bridging that was taking place between Cartesian and Newtonian ideas. Widely used throughout Europe, the textbook was, for example, recommended as the physics text for use at the University of Seville in 1768. Editions appeared at Brexia in 1735, 1745, and 1751, posthumously at Venice in 1756, 1761, and in the Opera Omnia of 1792.
","A teaching manual covering General and Particular Physics. General Physics includes: nature of bodies; motion; light and color; sound; touch; smell; motion of fluids and solids under gravity. Particular Physics includes: the heavens and the earth; meteorics; living organisms; the senses; human anatomy. The optics section of volume 1 (98 pages, the physics of light) includes: the aether and the wave nature of light; propagation of light; opaque and transparent materials; reflection of light and mirrors; refraction of light and lenses; dispersion; color. The optics section of volume 4 (57 pages, vision) includes: vision; ocular anatomy; direct vision; principles of reflected vision and catoptrics; principles of refracted vision and dioptrics including spectacles, the microscope, and the telescope. Done in the Scholastic style, with definitions, propositions, proofs, discussions, and corollaries. The presentation is detailed, geometric, and supported with many figures. The optics material in the second edition is more concise than in the first; there are fewer digressions, considerably less space devoted to history, and fewer references to authorities. There is more emphasis on and space devoted to experiments and discussion of their results.

","Desaguliers was a friend of 's Gravesande and knew his work well. That it was thought likely that an English translation of 's Gravesande's book would sell well is clear from the fact that the booksellers Senes and Taylor asked Desaguliers to produce a translation. It was commercially successful, widely read and used. Editions of Desagulier's translation of 's Gravesande appeared in 1720, 1726, 1731, 1737, 1741, and posthumously in 1747. The editions of the translation of 1731, 1737, and 1741 exhibit little change, reflecting the same states of the original Latin. But this, the sixth and last edition of the translation, is by far the most extravagant, detailed, and extensive. It is based on the third edition of 's Gravesande's <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i> of 1742, which was double the size of previous Latin editions. Consequently, the translation's format and content are considerably expanded. Now quarto rather than octavo, there is considerable added detail regarding experimental apparatus and discussion of the results obtained from their use. Consequently, this edition uses newly engraved plates with many new figures. There are 39 quarto-sized folding plates in this edition of the translation, compared to 15 octavo-sized plates in the fifth edition.

Contains the translations of 's Gravesande's prefaces to the first, second, and third editions of the <i>Physices Elementa Mathematica<i>. The optics section reflects the greatly expanded treatment in the third Latin edition. It is extensive (229 pages) and includes: The nature, propagation, and speed of light; sunlight and heliostats; refraction, a goniometer for its measurement; refractions at surfaces, lenses; ocular anatomy and vision; spectacles, microscopes and telescopes; reflection, spherical convex and concave mirrors; catoptric telescopes; magic lantern; colors and differing refraction; colors by reflection and refraction; the rainbow; colors in nature.

","Carlo Noceti and Rudjer Bo≈°koviƒá both belonged to the Assembly of the Arcadians, an academy founded in Rome in 1690 and patterned after meetings held by Queen Christian of Sweden of scientists, poets, and litterati. The academy had as its purpose 'to cultivate more the study of sciences and to awaken throughout Italy the good taste in humanistic letters, particularly in vulgar Poetry.' Noceti's poems are an example of works both scientifically didactic and poetic. Noceti's <i>De Iride<i> was first written in 1729 and took its inspiration from Newton's <i>Optice<i> of 1706. The sources for Noceti's <i>Aurora Boreali<i> are the <i>Trait√© Physique et Historique de l‚ÄôAurore Boreale<i> by de Mairan  of 1731 and 1733, and the <i>De Aurora Boreali Dissertatio<i> by Bo≈°koviƒá of 1738. A new edition of <i>De Iride<i> was prepared for this appearance in 1747. The extensive and thorough commentary and annotations by Bo≈°koviƒá were prepared early in 1747 expressly for this publication. The poems and their reception (praised by de Mairan and Abb√© Nollet) evidence a time when interest and talent in both natural philosophy and literature was common, even expected.||The Latin text was translated into Toscano by Antonio Abrogi, the Tuscan and Latin text appearing side-by-side in the publication of 1755.","Noceti's <i>De Iride<i> presents and rejects the hypotheses of Pliny, Seneca and other ancient authors on the origin of rainbow. He give an explanation of the phenomenon using the laws of refraction and the Newtonian theory of multichromatic white light and its dispersion by prism--in this case by drops of rain. Bo≈°koviƒá's notes are part history, part exposition and he demonstrates a wide knowledge of authors and works dealing with the rainbow; from Seneca and Pliny to De Dominis, from Descartes to Newton and Halley, Bo≈°koviƒá presents most theories of the rainbow. He finally presents a theory based on Descartes and Newton to explain how the rainbow is formed. Particularly important is the clear understanding and presentation of the multiple refractions responsible for multiple rainbows. Bo≈°koviƒá's notes are accompanied by a plate of figures that are essential since the notes become mathematically detailed when presenting Descartes's and Newton's ideas. The notes on the aurora borealis follow de Mairan closely.","‚ÅÇ Boscovich: scientist and man of letters|Proverbio, E.|<i>Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana Supplementi<i>, Vol 23, 2013, pp 34-54.||<i>The Rainbow: From Myth to Mathematics<i>|Boyer, C.

Johann Baptist Planck,"Planck, Johann Baptist",,1696-1765," ",Universae Matheseos Brevis Institutio,"A collection of short, summative teaching essays on parts of mixed mathematics. 
","Johann Baptist Planck is not credited as the collector and editor of the material in the <i>Universae Matheseos Brevis Institutio<i> until his name appeared on the title page of the third edition of 1760. In his Preface, Planck cites the extensive history that Jesuits had in presenting condensations, summaries, and compendia of what came to be called Mixed Mathematics, written specifically for teaching. He cites the earlier works of Pierre Gaultruche (the <i>Philosophi√¶ ac mathematic√¶ Totius Institutio<i> appeared between 1656 and 1695) and Claude Francois Milliet Dechales, (the <i>Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus<i> appeared in 1674 and 1690). He also notes that Gaultruche's work had been translated and used in Austria, France, and England.  Planck states that many developments have occurred and other Jesuit works appeared, and he has collected, summarized and cast them into a teaching text in the present compendium. Strangely, perhaps, he defends the very small images in the figures of plates--but suggests that they are simply provided as an aid and guide.||The text was expressly written for teaching, and (as Planck states) follows the format of definitions, postulates, axioms, hypotheses, theorems and proofs, following by problems giving examples. It is a mix of the up-to-date and the Peripatetic, giving insight into Jesuit teaching in eastern Europe at the time. Other authors are sometimes associated with this work: Johann Ivansics, SJ (1722-??) and Antal Reviczky (1723-1781). The text was popular enough that editions appeared in 1747, 1752, and 1760.","The works has two parts, each with separate title page and pagination, usually bound together. Part 1: Arithmetic, Geometry, Trigonometry, Mechanics, Statics, Hydrostatics, Hydraulics, Aereometry, Civil and Military Architecture. Part 2: Optics, Catoptrics, Dioptrics, Spherical Trigonometry, Astronomy and Geography, Chronology, Horography.||The optics material (33 pages) is in three parts, devoted to direct, reflected, and refracted vision. Each has several paragraph-long chapters. Part One deals with the eye and vision. Several aspects of perception are described: size, shape, location, distance, and motion. This part ends with the presentation of a few example problems, the application to perspective, and light and shadow. In this last section, elementary physical optics is considered. Even at the late date of its publication, color theory is Aristotelian: being the result of the mixing of white and black. Part Two briefly considers reflection and the properties of plane and curved mirrors. Part Three deals with refraction, applied specifically to spherical lenses. Tables of lens sizes and curvatures are presented for several sizes of telescopes. The microscope and magic lantern are briefly mentioned in this context.||The material is elementary with no mathematics beyond ratios being used, and is a mix of the up-to-date and the Peripatetic. The figures, though small, are essential to the understanding of the tightly-concise text.","The reception of classical literature in the literary production of the Universitas Tyrnaviensis|Karabov√°‚Äì≈†otkovsk√°, K.|In:  Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Congress of Neo-Latin Studies (Uppsala 2009), Brill, 2012, 1228 pp, NB: pp 613-623.","Universae matheseos brevis institutio theorico-practica ex operibus P.

Pierre Sigorgne,"Sigorgne, Pierre",,1719-1809," ",Institutions Newtoniennes,Textbook for the earliest Newtonian course in natural philosophy at the University of Paris.,"Few of the French clergy were well disposed to Newton‚Äôs physics, but Pierre Sigorgne was an exception. The first course in experimental physics to be taught at the University of Paris with a more empirical Newtonian orientation was Pierre Sigorgne‚Äôs, which was first delivered at the Coll√©ge Duplessis around 1740. The course and its notes were the basis for the <i>Institutions Newtoniennes<i>. Sigorgne was an ardent and vociferous experimental Newtonian who railed against the prevailing dependence on Descartes' physics; in particular, the reliance on Cartesian vortices to explain planetary motion. Sigorgne advocated Newton's notion of action-at-distance and embraced the elaborate mathematics Newton devised to describe central forces. Sigorgne applied this physics of attraction to most aspects of mechanics, statics, and importantly to optics. Gravity and its characterization was at the center of the growing dispute between Cartesians and Newtonians in France. In 1740 Sigornge had written a tract 'A Physico-Mathematical Demonstration of the Impossibility and Insufficiency of Vortices' that was translated into English and appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. He would famously tangle with Privat de Moli√®res on this same subject after the appearance of the <i>Examen et r√©futation des le√ßons de physique expliqu√©es pat M. de Moli√©res au coll√®ge royal de France<i> in 1741. Sigornge's career at the Coll√©ge du Plessis came to an abrupt end two years after the publication of this book, when he was dismissed after being implicated along with 14 others, and eventually imprisoned, for writing satirical verses about Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour.||Editions of the  <i>Institutions Newtoniennes<i> appeared at Paris in 1747 and 1769, and an Italian translation appeared at Lucca in 1757.","After his Preface, Sigorgne has a 25-page review of conic sections including their properties and geometric analysis. This is, no doubt, provided in anticipation of a consideration of Newton's exposition method in the Principia. This introduction is followed by 15 chapters. 1: The resistance of the plenum and the existence of the Vacuum; 2: Attraction, its mechanism and existence; 3: Law of Attraction at Great Distances; 4: Attraction and movement; 5: Circular Movement; 6: Movement in Conic Sections; 7: Metaphysical Exposition of the Preceding Chapter; 8: Movement of the Principal Planets; 9: The Figure of the Stars and the Earth; 10: Movement of the Moon and other Satellites; 11: Cause of the Procession of the Equinoxes; 12: Move of the Sea; 13: Attraction at very small distances, inverse-cube relationship, chemical effects; 14: Capillaries and Attraction; 15: On Light and Colors, the place of Attraction.||Regarding optics, Sigorgne uses attraction at very small distances to explain prismatic dispersion, equal-angle reflection, refraction, and diffraction. The use of attractive force to explain these phenomena had been suggested by Newton in the important Query on forces acting a distance that first appeared in the <i>Optice<i> of 1706.","Eighteenth-Century Conceptions of Gravitation|van Lunteren F.|In: International Archives of the History of Ideas, Petry M.J., editor, vol 136.

","In 1702, John Lowthorp, fellow of the Royal Society, devised a plan to collect, abridge, and publish papers that had appeared in the Philosophical Transactions up to 1700. He sought and received permission of the Society's Council to create and published abridgements of the accumulated back-run of the Transactions up to and including 1700. Interestingly, the Society did not expect or require and financial renumeration--considering acknowledgement and attribution sufficient, since it was primarily interested in the spread of knowledge. Lowthorp's project was a success, finding a wide audience, especially on the continent, among those interested in access to the papers in the back issues of the Transactions. The three-volume work first appeared in 1703-1708 and went through 5 editions. Commercial success and interest prompted a continued series of abridgements up to 1750. The Volume numbering started by Lorthorp was continued.  Vols. 4-5 have the title: <i>The Philosophical Transactions from the Year 1700 to the year 1720<i> and were edited by Henry Jones. Vols. 6-7 have the title: <i>The Philosophical Transactions from the Year 1719 to the year 1733<i> and were edited by James Eames and John Martyn. Vols. 8-9 have the title: <i>The Philosophical Transactions from the Year 1732 to the year 1744<i> and were edited by John Martyn. Vol. 10 has the title: <i>The Philosophical Transactions from the Year 1743 to the year 1750. Abridged and Disposed under General Heads. The Latin papers being translated into English<i> and was edited by John Martyn.||In 1721, Benjamin Motte published an unsanctioned abridgement of papers from the Philosophical Transactions for the years 1700-1720. This prompted the third, 1722 edition of Lowthorp's work to appear with an advertisement making clear that Lowthorp's edition had been approved by the Royal Society.||Lowthorp's and the subsequent series of collections, translations, and abridgements prompted a large project proposed to the Royal Society in 1803 by the mathematician and Society Fellow Charles Hutton: to select, abridge, and index the contents of the Transactions of the previous 135 years. Eventually the Society approved the project and in 1809 18 Volumes appeared, edited by Charles Hutton, George Shaw, and Richard Pearson.

","The work begins with a review of the algebra necessary for working with conic sections: powers and extraction of roots and working with radicals. Then the following curves are treated: parabola; ellipse; hyperbola; cissoid; conchoid; the quadratrix; spiral; and the cycloid. In each case, the history of the curve is given, method of generation, properties (tangents, directrix, focus), rotation into three dimensions, and applications. The applications of the parabola include cannon trajectory and a sound amplifier (porte-voix or megaphone). Most applications are in optics, and the various curves are applied to both mirrors and to lens surfaces for the construction of focusing and burning mirrors, lenses for spectacles and magnification. The section on the ellipse contains a dissertation of the sine law of refraction, its discovery, and the priority argument regarding Descartes and Snell. The section on the hyperbola contains a dissertation on the practicality of its use in lenses mirrors.

","Prince Sigismondo Chigi was a student of the Collegio Tolomei in Siena and student of Nicol√≤ Arrighetti. As was the custom, Chigi was listed as the defender of the thesis, but it was written by Arrighetti.

This thesis is derived from an earlier work of Arrighetti: his <i>Ignis Theoria<i> published at Siena in 1750.
","The theory defended is that light is a tendency of movement in a supremely tenuous luminous fluid or aether. This fluid or aether is the 'fire' referred to by earlier authors, filling the plenum of infinite space. It permeates all space and bodies. Impulses in this fluid cause light's effects, and  unless they encounter the surface of a body, travel in straight lines at a great and uniform speed.

Part Three includes: ocular anatomy, vision and eye-function; photometry; magnification and apparent size; lens and mirror analysis; lenses for aiding vision; reflecting and refracting telescopes; constructing telescopes. The material is detailed and mathematical, including the use of the calculus, with examples and solved problems. Newtonian forces are used to explain reflection and refraction, though Courtivron offers his own ideas regarding the cause for prismatic dispersion, relying on and extending the Alexis-Claude Clairut's explanation of refraction.","The Velocity of Light and the color Changes of Jupiter‚Äôs Satellites|Pedersen, K.M.|<i>Research Publications on Science Studies<i>, 2017, pp 1-44, NB pp 23-26.|http://css.au.dk/fileadmin/reposs/reposs-040.pdf","Traite d'Optique, Ou l'on donne la theorie de la lumiere dans le systeme Newtonien, avec de nouvelles solutions des principaux problemes de dioptrique & de catoptrique.

Mangold began teaching at Ingolstadt in 1748, assuming the task of developing and teaching a course on 'rational and experimental philosophy,' after the German Jesuit finally began to adopt Cartesian natural philosophy. This is the dissertation Mangold presented to the faulty, for which he was granted his DD.","A dissertation on the nature of light and color with an additional consideration of sound and a theory of refraction. The dissertation presents and discusses three investigations. On Sound: definitions, properties of sound, collection and reflection of sound, the echo; nature of harmony, music, and voice. On Light: definitions and observations; various opinions regarding light's nature and their refutation; Euler's proposed theory of light based on pulses and it accounting for reflection and refraction; arguments for the correctness of Euler's theory. On Color: definitions and observations; colors distinguished from the modification of light; famous authorities on color; prismatic refraction and color; the rainbow; refuting Newton's color theory. The entire treatment is Eulerian and based on his <i>Nova Theoria Lucis et Colorum<i> of 1746. The treatment is descriptive with no mathematics involved.

The prospectus listed Sav√©rien as the author and stated that the new dictionary would be 'drawn from the mathematical dictionaries of Ozanam, Wolf, Stone, and a large number of other works.' The large project took an additional three years: Though Sav√©rien lists nearly 800 authors and works he consulted in gathering material for his dictionary, Wolff's <i>Vollst√§ndiges Mathematisches Lexicon<i> of 1734. Sav√©rien divides the mathematical sciences in three branches: pure mathematics, physics and mixed mathematics. To Sav√©rien, Physics is  all 'the properties discovered by vision, touch, hearing, smell, and taste.' Thus, in Sav√©rien's schema, practically all fields of knowledge are related to physics and mathematics. But as it turned out, the dictionary is limited to Mixed Mathematics; the physics entries (mechanics, electricity, etc.) are limited in number and not extensively developed. A Spanish translation appeared at Madrid in 1775.

It covers: basic mathematics, geometry, integral and differential calculus, astronomy, mechanics, hydrodynamics, optics, aerometry, acoustics, pyrotechnics, civil and military architecture. The entries are of both word and subject type, generally concise, but varying in length from a sentence to several pages. More than 100 plates containing more than 400 figures accompany the entries. The optics entries include: colors, catoptrics, catadioptrics, dioptrics, light, lenses, mirrors, optics, vision, the eye, view, perspective, reflection, refraction (the longest, by far), microscopes, telescopes. The longer entries are detailed, filled with examples, and contain considerable mathematics; amounting to small essays on their subject.","‚ÅÇ  <i>The Forgotten Encyclopedia: The Maurists‚Äô Dictionary of Arts, Crafts, and Sciences, the Unrealized Rival of the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and d‚ÄôAlembert<i>|Holmberg, L.|Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies, Ume√• University, Ume√• 2014, pp 136-144.|http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:715277/FULLTEXT02.pdf","Dictionnaire universel de matheÃÅmatique et de physique, OuÃÄ l'on traite de l'origine, du progreÃÄs de ces deux sciences & des arts qui en deÃÅpendent, & ses diverses reÃÅvolutions qui leur sont arriveÃÅes jusqu'aÃÄ notre tems; avec l'exposition de leurs principes, & l'analyse des sentimens des plus ceÃÅleÃÄbres auteurs sur chaque matiere.

","By 1746 the Amsterdam publisher Isaac Tirion had produced a Dutch translation of John Desagulier's compendium of experimental natural philosophy. As it lacked any significant optics, the Dutch translator (never identified, but Jacobus Krighout (1703-1770) has been suggested), proposed a third volume: a Dutch translation of part of Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738: the 'Popular Treatise.' Tirion's and the translator's plans eventually expanded to include publication of a translation of Smith's  entire work. The list of 176 subscribers in the front matter is evidence of the keen interest of the Dutch in Smith's detailed optical treatise. Dutch interest in optical matters in general and telescopes in particular was responsible, in part, for the popularity, success, and influence of the book. The Dutch translation appeared at Amsterdam in 1753 and reissued with a new title page at The Hague in 1764.

By 1754 he had written <i>Sectionnum Conicarum Elementa<i> and <i>De transformatione locorum geometricorum<i>. These last two works were added as a third volume to the entire work that appeared in 1754. In the 1740's, while teaching at the Collegio Romano, Boscovich became interested in the principle of continuity and the notion of a single, point-based force that attracted or repelled depending the distance over which it acted. These ideas took an form in an attempt to explain the nature of light and optical reflection and refraction.||The material in volume three contains the first thorough, detailed presentation of the principle of continuity and is Boscovich's attempt to establish continuity as a law, to be applied generally to all of natural philosophy. It, and the notion of a single continuous force, would become the beginning point for hs <i>Theoria philosophiae naturalis<i> of 1758.||This first edition of the three-volume work appeared at Rome in 1754 and was reissued at Venice in 1757.","In the first part of volume 3, the elements of conic sections, Boscovich picks up Johannes Kepler's idea of the continuous transformation of one conic section to another: from the straight line one passes through an infinity of hyperbolas to the parabola, and then through an infinity of ellipses and then to the circle. And vice versa. At the heart of this process is continuous transformation which Boscovich attempts to establish as a 'law of continuity' that can used as a foundation for a theory of forces. Transformations, bound by continuity, are formalized by a series of eleven rules. To support his law and to make clear the process of using it, Boscovich provides many geometric examples.||Though based in mathematics (geometry), Boscovich asserts that the law of continuity can be applied outside a purely geometric setting to those phenomena in natural philosophy that can be modeled with mathematics.","Boscovich‚Äôs geometrical principle of continuity, and the 'mysteries of the infinity'|Del Centina, A., Fiocca, A.|In: <i> Historia Mathematica<i>, Vol 45, 2018, pp 131-175.","Elementorum Universae Mathesos Auctore P.

","French translation of the second edition of Hauksbee‚Äôs <i>Physico-mechanical Experiments<i> of 1719. The manuscript of the translation was found in Francois De Bremond's papers after his death. Desmarest reorganized the material, added a considerable number of notes, and saw the work through the press. Desmarest's extensive notes are particularly interesting for their explanation of Hauksbee's experiments and what can be interpreted from their results. The work received a 9-page very favorable review and summary in the Journal des Scavans of April 1756. The reviewer remarks: 'The notes and additions of M. Desmarest are printed in characters so minute and so tight that they could be used in another form to fill a considerable volume.' 
","Francois De Bremond's text is a translation of the posthumous second edition of the <i>Physico-Mechanical Experiments<i> of 1709. Hauksbee's book presents experiments and resulting propositions regarding electricity and the generation of 'barometric light', sometimes referred to as 'mercurial light.'  These experiments involved partial vacuum, static electricity, and what is now recognized as electro-luminescence of low-pressure discharges. The experiments and apparatus are described in great detail, with elaborate engraved figures. Taken together, the discussions present a theory of electricity and established a source of light that challenged current theories about the nature of light. Hauksbee used an air pump of his own design and construction to evacuate rotatable glass globes and cylinders, creating 'a fine purple light' inside them by rubbing the outside surface. The light would disappear gradually when air was let into the vessels, but at atmospheric pressure, rubbing (and so electrifying) the glass would enable it to attract woolen threads, etc. Hauksbee reports a series of experiments in optics, some of them concerning the refraction indices for a variety of substances, as measured by Snell‚Äôs law. In one such experiment he determined the indices for common air, vacuum and compressed air, using a hollow prism as well as an air pump and a condensing engine. He also developed a special instrument, made up of the prism, a stopcock, a gauge and a telescope. The supplement (100 pages) contained in this edition adds experiments to measure the refractive power of liquids, attempts to generate mercurial light with sulfur and metals, and other experiments involving specific gravity, electrostatics, and capillarity. The extensive added in the form of notes by Desmarest make this essentially a new work.","‚ÅÇ Francis Hauksbee and his air pump|Brundtland, T.|<i>Notes and Records of The Royal Society of London<i>, Vol 66, 2012, pp 253-272.||Early Electricity between Chemistry and Physics: The Simultaneous Itineraries of Francis Hauksbee, Samuel Wall, and Pierre Polini√®re|Freudenthal, G.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 2, 1981, pp 203-229.||Francis Hauksbee's theory of electricity|Home, R.W.|<i>Archive for History of Exact Sciences<i>, Vol 4, No 3, 1967, pp 203‚Äì217.","Experiences physico-mechaniques sur diffeÃÅrens sujets, et principalement sur la lumiere et l'electriciteÃÅ, produites par le frottement des corps.

","Samuel Klingenstierna's remarkable paper disproving Newton's assertion that chromatic dispersion and refraction were linked such that no series of refractions could bring light of 'different colors' to the same point of focus. That is, an image produced by lenses will always exhibit chromatic aberration. Newton's assertion arose from experiment 8 of Book I, Part II of the Opticks of 1704 and carried such authority that until Klingenstierna's paper was widely known, it was believed that no achromatic lensed instrument was possible. John Dollond and Leonhard Euler had a famous exchange regarding the correctness of Newton's experiment and after Klingenstierna reading this, he produced a Latin translation of his paper and, via his student Fredrik Mallet, sent it to John Dollond. Dollond wrote back to Klingenstierna: 'As soon therefore as I saw Reason to doubt of Sr. Isaac, I thought it high time to begin to think for my sled, and endeavor to find out the truth by Experiment.' A German translation of Klingenstierna's paper appeared in 1756 in the ongoing German translation of the proceedings of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences produced by Abraham Kastner. It by Kastner's translation that Klingenstierna's startling result became widely known. 
","Samuel Klingenstierna's analysis of Newton's assertion of the proportionality of refractive indices involved in refraction-dispersion rests on a simplified experiment considered by Klingenstierna: a wedge of glass with air above and water below. The sine law of refraction, the refractive indices, and the angle of the glass wedge, give the angles that describe a light rays air-prism-water path. All these are used to construct an ingenious geometric analog involving triangles within circular arcs. Klingenstierna used this to give a simple demonstration that Newton's statement regarding the proportionality of refractive indices could not be true in general, and applied only for prisms of small angle, and then only approximately.","‚ÅÇ  Samuel Klingenstierna and the Acchromatic Lens|Beckman, O.|<i>Journal of the Antique Telescope Society<i>, Vol 22, 2002, pp 9-16.||Skating on the Edge: Newton's Investigation of Chromatic Dispersion and Achromatic Prisms and Lenses|Shapiro, A.E.|In: <i>Wrong for the right Reasons<i>, Buchwald, J.Z., and Franklin, A., editors|Springer, 2005, pp 99-125.","Anm√§rkning vid Brytnings-Lagen af s√§rskilta slags Ljus-str√•lar, da de g√• ur ett genomskinande medel in i √•tskilliga andra.

Unlike the furor caused by Giovanni Rizzetti's attack on Newton's optics, the <i>De Luminis Affectionibus<i> of 1727, Cominale's attack appears to have been ignored. To be expected, perhaps; by the middle of the 18th century, Newtonian optics was widely accepted in Italy. A century later in <i>A Budget of Paradoxes<i> the mathematician Augustus De Morgan would quip regarding Cominale's work: 'The first volume upsets the theory of light; the second vacuum, <i>vis inertiae<i>, gravitation, and attraction. I confess I never attempted these big Latin volumes, numbering 450 closely-printed quarto pages. The man who slays Newton in a pamphlet is the man for me. But I will lend them to anybody who will give security, himself in ¬£500, and two sureties in ¬£250 each, that he will read them through, and give a full abstract; and I will not exact security for their return. I have never seen any mention of this book: it has a printer, but not a publisher, as happens with so many unrecorded books.' The third volume, included here, is exceedingly rare and dated 1769.

Chapter 14: The rainbow. Chapter 15: Permanent colors. The first four chapters are an elementary presentation of light and its properties. The remaining chapters attempt to refute the idea that white light or sunlight is an inhomogeneous compound of diverse colors. The new theory of color that is offered is a modification of Malenbranche's Cartesian idea of modified size and vibration of light particles. Following Giovanni Rizzetti, Cominale reported experiments and described results that refuted Newton's experiments with prismatic refraction and dispersion. These experiments are either difficult to understand or have results that have clearly been misinterpreted.","The Reception of Newtonian Optics in Italy|Casini, P.|In: <i>Renaissance and Revolution: Humanists, Scholars, Craftsmen and Natural Philosophers<i>|Cambridge University Press, 1993, pp 215-228.","Anti-Newtonianismi Pars Prima, In qua Newtoni de coloribus systema ex propriis principiis geometrice evertitur, et nova de coloribus theoria luculentissimis experimentis demonstratur.

It is likely that at the time, Boscovich did not know of Klingenstierna's demonstration that contrary to Newton's assertion, achromatic lens systems were theoretically possible. Thus, this dissertation describes the state of the art of telescope lens analysis and design immediately before the development of the achromatic telescope objective. It is in this work that the importance of knowing the index of refraction of materials emerges for Boscovich; something that will be central to his remaining work in optics. This dissertation is important in that it is among the first works to quantify the effects of aberrations and uncertainty on astronomical observations.
","A complete analysis of lenses used primarily as objectives for telescopes. Material includes: refraction at spherical glass surfaces; real and virtual images; equations relating lens curvature and foci for convex and concave figures; equations applied to lens design, examples; spherical and chromatic aberrations and their quantification; optics of the eye and eye-function; ocular images and lenses; ocular images, lenses, and the uses of telescopes; consequences of lens aberrations; aberrations and their effect on astronomical observations. Boscovich mentions Euler's 1747 claim regarding the achromatic nature of water-separated glass menisci modeled after the apparent achromatic optics of the eye, but given British and French work, considered this a vain hope.","R.

","Nollet was the leading experimental physicist for thirty years in mid-eighteenth-century France. His course of lectures, aimed at upper-class Parisian society, was accompanied by elaborate, if not spectacular, demonstrations of physical principles and the use of experimental apparatus. This was the source for the <i>Le√ßons de Physique<i>, which became as famous as the course itself and was the first step in establishing experimental physics in France. Nollet's work expressed in the <i>Le√ßons de Physique<i> led to a reorientation of physics teaching in French universities and was the model for a new generation of French physics textbooks, replacing those of Poliniere and Rohault. Though Nollet's physics was experimental, it was not, inherently, mathematical. He considered algebra and geometry helpful, but not essential.  The <i>Le√ßons de Physique<i> also had considerable influence outside France: in Italy, Spain, and Germany. Editions appeared at Paris 1743, 1745, 1749, 1754, 1759, 1764, 1767, 1771, 1775, 1783; at Amsterdam 1745, 1754,  and 1765;  in an Italian translation at Venice in 1746, 1751, and 1759; in a German translation at Erfurt in 1749; and in a Spanish translation at Madrid in 1757.
","Explanatory text to accompany a course of lectures in physics. The material covered includes: material bodies and their properties; simple and compound motion under central forces; gravity; hydrostatics; mechanics; nature and properties of air; nature and properties of water; nature and properties of fire; light and optics; stars and their movement; magnetism; electricity. All of tome five is devoted to optics (579 pages).  It includes: the nature, properties, and propagation of light; catoptrics, plane and spherical mirrors and their images; dioptrics, refraction, lenses and their images; color and differing refraction; vision, the eye, eye-function; spectacles, microscopes, telescopes, and the magic lantern. Nollet used large sections of Newton's Optice dealing with prismatic colors, the heterogeneity of white light, and differing refrangibility. Nollet did not accept the corpuscular theory of light proposed in Newton's Queries, presenting instead a modified form of Descartes' ideas. Forty-one experiments are described in the text, demonstrating each principal idea. The presentation is detailed, geometric, and accompanied by detailed figures.

Deneke, based solely on a listing of new books in volume 84 of the <i>Neue Genealogisch-Historische Nachrichten<i>, 'New Genealogical Historical News', of 1757 from publisher Johann Samuel Heinius. It lists the book as being available at the Leipzig 'Jubilate-Messe"" (Spring trade fair) that year in Heinius' bookshop.||The title page shows only 'C.L.D.' as the author. The book was reviewed anonymously in the Gottingische Anzeigen of June 1757 and very negatively by Abraham K√§stner in the Hamburgisches Magazin for 1757. Deneke's book is an elaborate compilation of material on many topics in optics from many sources--often quoted at length, without comment or assessment. Fifty-five authors and works are cited as references. The central interest is the utility and application of optics; the work presents almost no theory, but an abundance of detail is supplied regarding some aspects of optical instruments. As the list of contents shows, the structure is scattered and appears driven by the source Deneke accessed, rather than any specific plan. A strange book without any apparent influence.
","An attempt at a comprehensive compendium of optics. The book is in three parts. Part I Optics: the eye and eye function, optical experiments, optical instruments, anamorphosis, anamorphic adjustment of images in a plane, in a cone, and in a pyramid.

Part III Dioptrics: refraction, figuring and polishing lenses and prisms and menisci, experiments with images and foci, the microscope and objective lenses, compound microscope, telescopes, helioscopes, periscopes, micrometers, camera obscura, experiments, the magic lantern.

Tosca wrote for his students, and the style and clarity of the books benefited from his long practice in teaching. The nine volumes are meant to cover all of mathematics and philosophy: I Arithmetic and Geometry, II Algebra and music, III Trigonometry and conics, IV Statics and Hydrostatics, V Civil and Military Architecture, VI Optics and Meteorics, VII Astronomy, VIII Geography and Navigation, IX Gnomics and Astrology. Tosca's textbooks were widely used and responsible, in part, for the introduction of modern science in Spain. The volumes of the first edition appeared at Valentia between 1707 and 1715. It was reprinted in Madrid in 1727 and 1757.
","The first teaching compendium of natural philosophy in Castilian. Volume six contains five sections on optics and meteorics, treatises XVIII - XXII. Section I Optics: general considerations and definitions; nature and propagation of light; nature of colors; transparent and opaque bodies; view and vision; eye-function; perception of size and shape; binocular vision. Section II Perspective: principles, iconographic and orthographic projection; methods for representing objects in various orientations; linear perspective; perspective of light, shadow, and reflected bodies; perspective of curved surfaces. Section III Catoptrics: general considerations an definitions; plane mirrors and their properties; convex and concave mirrors; cylindrical mirrors; spherical mirrors, caustics. Section IV Dioptrics:  refraction and its effects; cause and properties of refraction; location of refracted images; refractive glasses and their properties; combining refracting bodies; convex lenses, concave lenses; refraction and the generation of colors. Section V Meteorics: the sea and the wind; atmosphere and clouds, all type of precipitation; lighting; lights generated in the air; the rainbow; other forms of light; comets. Though the basis is essentially Cartesian, also cited are Grimaldi, Kircher, Scheiner, Zahn, Dechales, Rheyta, Zucchi, but not Huygens (1690) or Newton (1704).

Damianus of Larrisa,Damianus of Larrisa,Heliodorus of Larissa,? 500-600 BC,"Translated by Antonio Matani (1730 - 1779)  Italian scholar, natural philosopher.",Heliodori Lariss√¶i Capita opticorum,"A redaction of Euclid's optics, meant as a brief introduction, produced by Damianus of Larrisa who edited the early Greek text of Heliodorus.","Damianus of Larrisa was (perhaps) the son or pupil of Heliodorus of Larrisa and edited the earlier Greek text of Heliodorus. All this is inferred from the title of the most complete title of extant manuscripts: Chapters of the Optical Hypotheses of Damianus of Heliodorus of Larissa. It is a redaction of Euclid's Optica, tinctured with a bit of optics from late antiquity, and apparently meant only as a brief introduction to optics. Its outline form and nature suggests that is was a prelude to a larger work. The Greek text is followed by Antonio Matani's slightly edited Latin translation of Egnatius Danti of 1573 and some notes added by Matani.
","A redaction of Euclid's optics, meant as a brief introduction. The central premise is the identity of sight and light. There are 15 chapters.  1: Sight is something emitted from the eye. 2: What the eye emits is light or visual rays. 3: Sight moves in straight lines. 4-5: Visual rays comprise a right-angled cone. 6: The cone of vision is a discrete set of rays. 7: A viewed object is seen under an acute or right angle. 8: What is seen from a larger angle seems larger. 9: We see best along the axis of the cone. 10: Visual power is greatest in front of us. 11: The vertex of the visual cone is inside the pupil. 12: We see either directly or by rays broken by reflection or refraction. 13: Visual and solar rays behave similarly. 14: Our visual rays are reflected at equal angles. 15: Similarly for solar rays. The Greek and Latin text is followed by notes in which Matani discusses the history of Euclid's idea of visual rays emitted by the eye and how it was treated by subsequent authors. This is followed by a letter to the Archbishop of Turin discussing Heliodorus and a few others.","‚ÅÇ Damianus (Heliodorus Larissaeus)|Todd, R.B.|In: <i>Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum: Medieval and Renaissance Latin Translations and Commentaries, Annotated Lists and Guides Vol 8<i>|Brown, V., editor|Catholic University Press, 2003, pp 1-6.",Heliodori larissaei Capita opticorum latine vertit et inlustravit Antonius Matani Pistoriensis Philsoph.

Johann Heinrich Lambert,"Lambert, Johann Heinrich",,1728-1777," ",Les propri√©t√©s remarquables de la route de la lumi√®re,Mathematical analysis of refraction through spherically concentric layered media with applications to atmospheric refraction.,"It is know from Lambert's Monatsbuch (monthly diary) that he began working on aspects of refraction through the atmosphere in 1752, and from 1754 this work was carried out in parallel with his work on photometry. On the general subject of atmospheric refraction, Lambert cites the work of Bouguer, Smith, K√§stner, and in particular, Giovanni Domenico Cassini. He also cites a memoir by Euler on a related subject. Unlike previous work and unlike other optical work at the time, Lambert does not find it necessary to posit a theory of the nature of light to produce practical work in optics. His approach is what is now called phenomenological. He adopted the same stance in his <i>Photometria<i> of 1760. Optical phenomena can be measured, studied, and mathematicized without having to know their underlying physical nature or cause. In his Review of Optics, which serves as a preface, Lamber mentions the studies of authors listed above and the many phenomena that need examining. He notes that: 'The only case, which seemed even less examined, is the one where the light passes successively through several spherical and concentric media. I have tried in this treatise to make up for this defect'.||Lambert wrote to produce solutions to practical problems in astronomy and geodesy, specifically to provide equations that could be used to correct observations and measurements for atmospheric refraction. Consequently, his approach to optics is purely mathematical, and in the present work invokes physical experiment infrequently, and then only to gather phenomenological data. Following Euclid and to some extent Newton, Lambert proceeds by 'experiments', 'theorems', 'proofs', 'corollaries', 'lemmas', 'propositions', 'problems' and 'solutions'. Though the work is based on geometry, Lambert invokes the calculus with an off-handedness uncommon at the time. Editions appeared in 1758 and 1759.","The book is divided into three parts: 1 'The general properties of the route which light takes, passing through refractive, spherical and concentric media'; 2 'Astronomical refractions, how to approximate them as exactly as desired, and how they relate to various other problems'; and 3 'Circular refractions, their use in determining terrestrial refractions, and various other problems depending on both astronomical and terrestrial refractions.' Beginning with Snell's law, the first part establishes a differential equation that defines a light path through layered refractive concentric spheres, showing that the total effect of multiple layers can be modeled with a single layer of appropriate refractive power.  Importantly, Lambert does not invoke any theory regarding refraction related to atmospheric density. The path is defined to be the arc of a circle and the analytic problem is that of determining its center and radius.  The second and third parts are applications of this theory to practical problems. In each situation, approximate integration of the governing differential equation gives the desired result, making effective use of infinite series for these tasks. These problems include correcting observed astronomical positions, estimating the effect of atmospheric refraction on near-horizon positions from measurements at higher elevations, determining the true height of large objects from optical measurements, and other geodesic problems. Lambert compares predictions from his equations with data when they are available.","<i>Les Propri√©t√©s Remarquables de la Route de la Lumi√®re, par les Airs et en G√©n√©ral par Plusieurs Milieux R√©fringens Sph√©riques et Concentrigues.<i>|Radelet, P., Speiser, D., Bossy, L., editor and commentators|Facsimile Editions Alain Brieux, Paris, 1977.||Johann Heinrich Lamberts Monatsbuch|Bopp, K.|Abhandlungen der K√∂niglich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenshaften, Mathematisch-physikalische Klasse, XXVII.

Rudjer Josip Bo≈°koviƒá,"Bo≈°koviƒá, Rudjer Josip","Boscovich, Ruggero",1711-1787," ",Philosophiae Naturalis Theoria (a),Second edition of Boscovich's theory of everything: point entities interacting and agglomerating by why of a single attractive-repulsive force.,"Boscovich's <i>Theoria<i> has it's origins 15 years prior to its publication when Boscovich was at the Collegio Romano. His investigations into optics, particularly refraction, posed  long-standing explanatory problems of cause and origin that had had no solution. The earliest version of Boscovich's force law appears in the <i>Dissertatio de Lumine<i> of 1748 and an early version of the famous oscillating plot of repulsive and attractive force appears here. These optical problems, others of a more general nature, and the ideas of force of Newton and monads of Leibniz, motivated his work on the <i>Theoria<i>. Its success was immediate and widespread and remains one of the most important books in science history. It was highly influential on British physicists: Priestley, Robinson, Faraday, Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, J. J. Thompson, and Niels Bohr. All acknowledged its importance. In 1898 Lord Kelvin said 'My present assumption is Boscovichianism pure and simple.' The importance of this theory was widely recognized; in Britain, the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica<i> devoted fourteen pages to it in 1801. Boscovich had been the first supporter in Italy of Isaac Newton's theory of gravitation, and the <i>Theoria<i> was looked upon in Britain as an interesting speculative extension of the Newtonian system. Editions appeared at Vienna in 1758 and 1759 and revised edition at Venice in 1763.","Boscovich theory has two fundamental components: extentless indivisible points (his 'puncta') that constitute matter, and a single continuous force that is attractive or repulsive depending on distance. This force law is such that repulsion and attraction alternate as distance from the point increases; the oscillating plot of this force is perhaps the most famous figure from text and was often reproduced in subsequent works. As point separation becomes negligible, the repulsive force become infinitely large and so points cannot touch. As point separation grows, the repulsive diminishes until at greater distance it becomes attractive, and then farther out the force again becomes repulsive and so on alternatively, until it becomes permanently attractive at large separations. Boscovich conceived of this force has a 'single species' but with positive or negative effect.||At a definite set of distances from a points, the force is neither attractive or repulsive and so mutual positions of 'cohesion' can be established between points and so can remain at a fixed distance from each other, even though they are moving. This allows Boscovich's points to have definite fixed orbits around one another. So, for example, two points can have a third orbiting around them in an elliptical orbit, with the two points at the foci of the ellipse. This allowed Boscovich to posit the existence of higher-order structures (molecules) consisting of nothing put his extentless indivisible points and his force law.||There were many consequences to Boscovich's theory, which provided a complete mechanical explanation for all of natural philosophy. One was that it allowed Boscovich to offer the image of a super-powerful calculating intelligence  that if it knew the precise location and momentum of every particle in the universe, it could in principle calculate the history and future of every particle.  Boscovich's  formulation of this principle of determinism is in the <i>Theoria<i> and is rooted in and elaborated by physical terms--rather than metaphysical arguments--like position, velocity, direction and center of mass. He also showed that the continuity of force is a necessary assumption for determinism, which he presented it in strict mathematical form. Another consequence of the theory were natural or innate distances (for such things as orbits) which scale-free Newtonian force law does not provide. More speculatively, the theory allowed permeability and penetrability of 'solid' objects, the existence of hyperdense matter, and an explanation (as was Boscovich's original inspiration) for the phenomenon of optical refraction.","<i>Roger Joseph Boscovich, S.J., F.R.S., 1711‚Äì1787: Studies of His Life and Work on the 250th Anniversary of His Birth <i>|Whyte, L.L., editor|Fordham University Press, New York, 1961, 230 pp.||<i>Roger Boscovich: The Founder of Modern Science<i>|Stoiljkovich, D.|Anderton, R., translator and editor|Pentnica Science Center, Valjevo, 2014, 92 pp.","Philosophiae Naturalis Theoria Redacta ad Unicam Legera Virium In Natura Existentium.

The <i>Anfangsgr√ºnde der angewandten Mathematik<i> is Part Two, consisting itself of two parts: aspects of mechanics and optics, and astronomy, geography, chronology and gnomics. K√§stner's text not only filled the need for a technical book in the vernacular in German universities, but also furthered his program to demonstrate the importance and utility of applied mathematics. The initial preliminary material meant that beginning students could start their study with mathematics, while advanced students could begin with its applications. Editions of the the <i>Anfangsgr√ºnde der angewandten Mathematik<i> appeared in 1759, 1765, 1780/1781, and 1792. Each edition has a new preface and contains revisions by K√§stner, clarifying proofs, updating or adding material. The widespread and continuing use of these texts was due, in part, to K√§stner's interest in making sure they were up to date. Thus, each edition gives an accurate idea of what was thought to be important to teach regarding natural philosophy.

II Catoptrics: mirrors, law of reflection, plane mirrors, spherical mirrors, higher-order mirrors. III Dioptrics: refraction, refraction at air and glass, finding the refracted beam from the incident, total internal reflection, types of lenses, foci, image of a point, image of an object, color, the eye, eye-function and spectacles, the telescope, the microscope, diffraction of light.

Benjamin Martin,"Martin, Benjamin",,1704-1782," ",New Elements of Optics,"A supplement to Martin's previous optics book of 1740, incorporating important developments in optics theory and instruments and his own work in microscopes.","Benjamin Martin intended this to be a supplement to his previous optics book of 1740. Important developments in theory and instruments had occurred in twenty years since the previous book, and his own work in microscopes had also advanced considerably, so a new book was desirable. Apparently, the new book was written in two stages, Parts I, II, and II appearing in 1759, and Parts IV, V, and VI written later. The last three parts appeared with their own, undated title page, but all six parts are usually found bound together with the original title page of 1759 and the second title page separating the two sections. As with the earlier text of 1740, the material is detailed and focused on the practical aspects of optics, particularly regarding the design, construction, and use of optical instruments. The basis for Martin's involvement in the controversy over John Dollond's patent of the crown-flint glass achromatic lens appears in the later chapters of Part III on chromatic aberration. The material is highly detailed, analytic, and clearly evidences Martin's significant practical experience with telescopes and microscopes. This is one of the few English texts in the 18th century devoted solely to optics; the list of such texts being short: Smith in 1738, Benjamin Martin in 1740 and 1758, William Emerson in 1768, Harris posthumously in 1775, Higgins in 1776, and Woods in 1799.

Part II: Theory of spherical aberrations in lenses, correcting and improving spherical aberration. Part III: Chromatic aberration and achromatic lenses; designing achromatic lenses; prismatic refraction; telescopes with achromatic lens combinations; catadioptric telescopes; imperfect images from lensed telescopes; superiority of reflecting telescopes, general equations for the design of mirrors and lenses; lenses of figures of conic sections. Part IV: General theory of dioptrics, Newton's dioptric experiments. Part V: The eye and vision; spectacles; theory of the telescope; simple and compound microscopes; spherical and chromatic aberrations in microscopes.

William Porterfield,"Porterfield, William",,1696-1771," ",A treatise on the eye,"An account of the anatomy and physiology of the eye, light, and optics as related to vision.","An account of the anatomy and physiology of the eye, and extensive material on light and optics as related to vision and perception. Porterfield has extensive knowledge of ophthalmological history, quoting widely from previous authors and correcting several errors then lingering in ophthalmological books. He is also aware of then-current and latest information; this is particularly the case regarding the nature of light and colors. Porterfield reports many of his original experiments and results on visual physiology, which advanced that field considerably. Importantly, he argued against the too-extensive use of the analogy of the eye as a camera obscura: the Mind does not see the images on the retina. Porterfield also did important work in accommodation, eye movement, visual pathways and binocular vision. He utilized an experiment of Scheiner to create the optometer, an instrument used to determine the eye's focal distance. These were the many reasons why Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz would later cite the great usefulness of Porterfield's book. 
","A general treatise on the eye, vision, light, and visual perception. Two Volumes in five books. Book I Subservient Eye Parts: eye brows, eye lashes, lachrymal glands and ducts. Book II Body of the Eye: placement, connection, and motion of the eyes; fabric and structure; tunics; cornea; choroid; pupil, retina and optic nerve; humors; crystalline lens. Book III Vision: nature and properties of light; ocular optics; adaptation; pupil motion; function of the retina and optic nerve. Book IV Animal eyes: differing placements and structures. Book V Visual Perception: two eyes resulting in a single perception; erect appearance of objects; color of objects; size of objects; distance of objects; orientation of objects; shape of objects; motion of objects. Many sections begin with a general review and consideration of past works and their authors; Porterfield is clearly knowledgeable of the history of ophthalmology, theories of light and color, and geometric optics. The material on light and color is entirely Newtonian, though many previous works and authors are cited.

This is essentially a reproduction of the earlier <i>Essai D'Optique<i> of 1729, showing how the inverse square law and brightness comparisons could be used to obtain the relative luminous power of different sources, determine the reflective power of surfaces, and the transmittance of transparent objects. Book II: Research on the reflection of light from polished and rough surfaces. This is an attempt to relate the amount and distribution of reflected light to the physical and optical properties of surfaces. Book III: Research on transparent and opaque bodies. Presents the law of exponential decay of light in absorbing transparent bodies of constant and varying densities. Book II is filled with lacunae which De La Caille left unfilled. Generally they are places Bouguer intended to fill with experimental results; making Book little more than a description of Bouguer's plan to gather data about reflectance of polished and rough surfaces and how it might be used to build a computational model of such reflections.

His standard course consisted of 12 lectures and though the book's contents lists 12 lectures, the course content on astronomy was displaced in the book by material on globes. Lecture attendees who wished for full written coverage also had to purchase Ferguson's earlier work, Astronomy Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton's Principles of 1756. Both books reflect the interest in experimental natural philosophy by the middle-class in mid 18th century England, as well has the subjects and depth of coverage that were popular and possible. Forty years after the first edition, David Brewster would recount in his updated edition how successful and widely used Ferguson's book was: 'Mr. Ferguson ... may be regarded as the first elementary writer on natural philosophy, and to his labours we must attribute that general diffusion of scientific knowledge among the practical mechanics of this country...'

These concepts, quantities, and principles are still in use today. It established what is now called illuminating engineering by showing how to photometrically compare light sources, measure the optical properties of materials, quantify aspects of vision, and calculate illumination. The book is fundamentally experimental and mathematical. One of the first to make extensive application of the calculus, Lambert's mathematical work was considered strange at the time; critics wondering of what possible use his results could have. Many of Lambert's equations found application early in the 20th century in illuminating engineering.
","<i>Photometria<i> is in seven parts. Part I: First principles of photometry, visual photometry, illuminating power. Part II: Measurement of transmittance of plane glass and lenses, calculations of luminous power from lenses. Part III: Measurement of reflectance, calculation of light reflected from polished mirrors and rough surfaces, diffusely reflecting surfaces, calculations involving diffuse surfaces. Part IV: Luminous power, visual brightness defined. Part V: Dispersion in transparent media, calculation of path and luminous power in the atmosphere, calculation of twilight. Part VI: Illumination and brightness of the planets. Part VII: Brightness of colors, calculation of daylight. Forty experiments are described and their data analyzed.

Rampinelli lectured on optics between 1747 and 1753 at the University of Pavia and produced these notes for the benefit of other professors in his university. The <i>Lectiones Optic√¶<i> was edited and seen through the press after Rampinelli‚Äôs death by his student Caesareus Sommariva. The front matter contains a letter from Sommariva to the Senate of Milan about the work and a biography of Rampinelli by Francesco Torriceni. Clearly the work of a mathematician, the <i>Lectiones Optic√¶<i> are inspired by, and to some extent based on, the geometrical optics lectures of Isaac Barrow.  Rampinelli lectures present an elaborate demonstration of the principal aspects of geometric optics applied to mirrors and lenses. Though little new material is presented, the lectures are remarkable for their detail and the use of geometry in the elaborate proofs of theorems regarding the behavior of mirrors and lenses.
","A compendium of geometrical optics consisting of fifteen lectures. I: Introduction; nature of light and light rays; angles of reflection and refraction; point sources; divergence and convergence; luminous bodies; the speed of light; theorems on illumination. II: Rectilinear propagation of rays; rays and angles of reflection; rays and angles of refraction. III: Reflection from conic sections; optic densities and angles of refraction. IV: Problems in reflected geometric optics of plane surfaces; near and distant sources. V: Problems in refracted geometric optics of plane surfaces. VI: Refraction at curved surfaces, foci and images. VII: Reflection from spherical surfaces; foci and images. VIII: Convex and concave mirrors and lenses; rays from point sources. IX: Other aspect of catoptrics. X: Lenses; geometric analysis; foci and images; distant point sources. XI: Problems in refracted geometric optics of lenses. XII: Law of refraction applied. XIII: Refraction at multiple surfaces and lenses; spectacles. XIV: Magnification by mirrors and lenses. XV: The telescope. The material is entirely geometrical optics; physical optics is touched on only briefly in the introduction.

Jean le Rond D'Alembert wrote extensively on optics between 1760 and 1770 and much that is collected in the <i>Opuscules MatheÃÅmatiques<i> and virtually all of it was devoted to the theory of lenses, their various aberrations, and an analysis of various dispersion laws. Like Clairaut before him, D'Alembert was convinced that a useful theory of achromatic lenses could be developed if sufficient mathematical power was brought to bear on the problem. He and others recognized that the dispersion laws proposed by Newton could not be correct and that other mathematical statements expressing dispersion were required. He developed an elaborate mathematical apparatus of lens analysis and design, but it had little practical effect on telescope maters. Herschel groused in the Philosophical Transactions of 1821: '. . . from all the abstruse researches of Clairaut, Euler, D'Alembert, and other celebrated geometers, nothing hitherto has resulted beyond a mass of complicated formulae, which, though confessedly exact in theory, have never yet been made the basis of construction for a single good instrument, and remain therefore totally inapplicable, or at lease unapplied in practice.' In fact, it would not be until the more accurate determination of refractive index as a function of wavelength was possible that Clairaut's and D'Alembert's work could be used. This would happen only after the Fraunhofer's discovery of lines in the solar spectrum and the development of spectroscopy.

Three years later it was expanded into the <i>Dictionnnaire de Physique<i>; a textbook masquerading as a subject dictionary meant for the autodidact and the student. Paulian drew from many sources and the Preface of first edition of the <i>Dictionnnaire<i> gives 3 and one-half, two-column pages of works and authors. Paulian's natural philosophy was not purely Newtonian, and unlike Desaguliers who presented Newtonian ideas without ornament or interference, Paulian was in an ongoing process of developing his own amalgam of Cartesian and Newtonian natural philosophy, and the <i>Dictionnnaire<i> reflects this free blending and extrapolation. The material in the <i>Dictionnnaire<i> is wide-ranging, with 'Physics' given a very wide compass--the first entry is 'Abdomen.' As new developments appeared Paulian augmented and revised the <i>Dictionnnaire<i>, and so each edition was significantly expanded. Starting as three volumes, it grew to four and eventually to five. An example is an article on achromatic telescopes added to the second edition of 1773. Editions appeared in 1761, 1773, 1781, and 1789. An Italian translation appeared at Venice in 1770, 1779, 1790, and 1794.
","The optics entries in the <i>Dictionnaire<i> are among its most extensive and include the following Catoptrique: laws of reflection, reflected images, convex and concave mirrors. Coulerus: Newton's prismatic colors, object colors, Newton's explanation of color, Descartes's unsustainable system, the rainbow. Diffraction: definition, cause. Dioptrique: convex and concave lenses, convergent and divergent rays, burning lenses, analogies with mirrors, lens foci. Lumiere: nature and propagation of light; light as corpuscles traveling nearly infinitely fast; various atmospheric luminous phenomena. Microscope: simple and compound microscope, solar microscope, brief history. Ombre: shadows cast by large sources, shadows of the earth and moon, astronomical distances determined from shadows. Optique: direct light, visual perception, persistence, binocular vision, vision and spectacles. Reflexion: cause of reflection, elasticity. Refraction: atmospheric refraction, refraction in solids, law of refraction, cause of refraction. Telescope: dioptric and catoptric telescopes, the Newtonian and Gregorian telescope. Most of these entries are concise explications containing propositions and demonstrations accompanied by figures. The material is descriptive, invoking no mathematics above geometry.","‚ÅÇ <i>Aim√©-Henri Paulian (1722-1802) et sa physique ¬´Newto-Cart√©sienne¬ª: l‚Äôoptique newtonienne revisit√©e<i>|Mulard, P.|Thesis, University of Lille, 2015, 359 pp, NB  pp 253-307.|http://ori-nuxeo.univ-lille1.fr/nuxeo/site/esupversions/1d61fb2c-cd98-4768-b91e-295d252d31f0","Dictionnaire De Physique : DeÃÅdieÃÅ A Monseigneur Le Duc De Berry.

The first discourse gives a general treatment of the eye, its optics and function, the nature of lenses, the correction of myopic, hyperopic, and presbyopic vision by spectacles, and the magnification of images by lenses in general. The second discourse, first part, is on spyglasses and telescopes, including: lensed telescopes, optical levels, catadioptric telescopes, catoptric telescope. The second discourse, second part, is on microscopes, including: simple microscopes, compound microscopes, solar microscopes, catadioptric microscopes, catoptric microscopes, the 'universal' microscope. The second discourse, second part, is on various lenses, burning mirrors, cameras obscura, and magic lanterns. The instruments are described in considerable detail, but without any elaborate theory or mathematics. Importantly, Selva describes his implementation of various instruments to measure refractive index and dispersion, based on the work of Boscovich. Selva was one of the earliest builders of a version of Boscovich's Vitrometer. His ties with Boscovich provided access to knowledge of the development of achromatic lenses in England. This, the technology of dispersion measurement, and access to Venice's Murano glass works and  high-quality flint glass, helped Selva produce some of the best achromatic telescopes in Europe.","‚ÅÇ La Famiglis Selva, Ottici del '700 Veneziano|Lualdi, A.|<i>Nuncius<i>, Vol 16, No 2, 2001, pp 531 ‚Äì 546.","Esposizione delle comuni, e nuove spezie di cannocchiali, telescopi, microscopi, ed altri istrumenti diottrici, catottrici, e catodiottrici perfezionati ed inventati da Domenico Selva ottico in calle large a S.

Leonhard Euler,"Euler, Leonhard",,1707-1783," ",Constructio lentium obiectivarum ex duplici vitro,"Euler addresses the problem of simultaneously minimizing chromatic and spherical aberration in telescope lenses.","Euler provoked Newtonians with his paper 'Sur la Perfection des Verres Objectifs des Lunettes,' published by the Royal Academy at Berlin in 1747. It stated that, contrary to Newton's claim, telescope lenses could be constructed that did not exhibit chromatic aberration. This was the basis for Euler's later and more extensive work on lenses that minimized chromatic and spherical aberration, and was first submitted by Jacobi to the Berlin Academy in 1761 but it was never published in its memoirs. Euler submitted the work to the St. Petersburg Academy for its prize question regarding the perfection of telescopes. By the time this paper was submitted, John Dollond had published his paper on his prism experiments and the making of his achromatic telescope lens. But reducing both spherical and chromatic aberration remained a difficult problem and it was that which Euler addressed in his submission to the St. Petersburg Academy.","Euler addresses the problem of simultaneously minimizing chromatic and spherical aberration in telescope lenses. Two lenses with differing indices of refraction could produce an achromatic telescope objective, but the great curvatures required increased spherical aberration. Euler derives equations that, given glass refractive indices, yield the size, curvature, and focal length of a two-lens telescope objective. The paper ends with four examples, worked out in detail, considering four different pairs of refractive indices, the last involving water and glass. An appendix gives the resulting simplifications if some of the constraints are relaxed or removed.","New Light on an Old Question: Who Invented the Achromatic Telescope?|Rudd, M.E., Jaecks, D.H., Willach, R., Sorrenson, R., and Abrahams, P.|<i>Journal of the Antique Telescope Society<i>, Vol 19, 2000, pp 3-12.","Constructio lentium obiectivarum ex duplici vitro quae neque confusionem a figura sphaerica oriundam, neque dispersionem colorum pariant, Auctore Leonhardo Eulero.

Reset from a direct reading of the edition of 1712, the last produced by Malebranche before his death, in order to (From the Avis des Libraires) 'rectify the prodigious quantity of errors which had slipped into the editions that appeared since his death'.
","By the time of the third edition of Malebranche's <i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i>, his ideas concerning light and color had under gone considerable development. In 1687 his writing reflected an idea he had introduced into Descartes' concept of light being a percussively transmitted pressure in the plenum: the pressure or 'tendency to motion' was not static but consisted of periodic variations, which he called 'pressure vibrations.' In 1699 Malebranche was elected an honorary academician of the French Academy of Science to which he read his memoire 'Reflection Light and Colors and the Generation of Fire.' By the time of this memoire he had significantly modified Descartes' ideas of regarding the nature of light in part because of Romer's discovery of light's finite travel speed Huygens ideas concerning wave propagation. Malebranche developed his idea of pressure vibrations to explain color: vibrations of different 'promptitude' (what would now be described as frequency) produced different colors, and different amplitudes produced different intensities. But however changed from Descartes' original ideas, it was fundamentally a mechanical philosophy.||This memoire would eventually become the 16th Elucidation Malebranche added to the 1700 edition of <i>De la Recherche de la Verit√©<i>.

","A brief dissertation on the theory, function, and design of a telescope objective made from two lenses of differing indices of refraction. This was the first continental description of Dollond's two-lens telescope objective. Dollond's article <i>An Account of Some Experiments concerning the Different Refrangibility of Light<i> had appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1757. In it, Dollond describes repeating Newton's experiment regarding the inseparability of refraction and dispersion, and obtaining a different result than that reported by Newton in his Opticks of 1704. Taking this new result as a basis for correcting chromatic aberration, Dollond built a two-lens telescope objective with water between the lenses. Dollond's objective significantly reduced chromatic aberration. It is this work that Sherffer summarizes, adds to, and explains. This Latin text was the basis for Scherffer's <i>Neue Verbesserung dioptrischer Fernr√∂hren<i> that appeared at Leipzig in 1764.
","The dissertation describes the Dollond two-glass telescope objective of convex and concave lenses of differing indices of refraction. An analysis is provided of the displacement of focal lengths for limiting red and violet rays, which in turn provides an estimate of the residual chromatic blur. Examples using typical lens sizes, curvatures, and indices of refraction are worked out in detail. References are made to the work of Boscovich and Clairaut on the problem of designing achromatic objectives.","Dollond & Son's Pursuit of Achromaticity, 1758‚Äì1789|Sorrenson, R.|<i>History of Science<i>,Vol 39, No 1, 2001, pp 31-55.","De emendatione telescopiorum dioptricorum per vitrum objectivum compositum recens a Dollondo in Anglia inventa, dissertatio conscripta a P.

","Between 1755 and 1763 Benjamin Martin wrote 'The General Magazine of Arts and Sciences', published monthly by W. Owen. The original plan was for the Magazine to present material in four areas: A General Survey of Nature and Art; An Entire System of Natural History including Geography and Geology; A Compleat Body of Arts and Sciences not Mathematical; A Series of Mathematical and Mechanical Institutions of Geometrical Science. Generally, each issue contained material for all four areas, printed in such a way that each issue could be separated into sections dealing with each of the four parts and later collected into a more-or-less complete book. The volume titled <i>A New and Comprehensive System of Mathematical Institutions<i> appeared in two volumes; 1759 and 1764, containing all the material that had appeared related to part four of the general plan.
","Martin's  <i>Mathematical Institutions<i> is in two volumes. The first (1759) contains all the preliminary mathematical material: Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, conics, and fluxions. Volume 2 (1764) contains: Phyico-mechanical mathesis, universal optics, universal perspective, loxodromics or navigation, ballistics or gunnery, horology of clockwork. The optics section (42 pages) is in three sections: catoptrics, dioptrics, and perspective. Each begins with a theoretical section, followed by applications. Catoptrics covers: reflection, foci and images from mirrors, burning mirrors. Dioptrics covers: refraction, refraction at plane and curved surfaces, convex and concave lenses, caustics, foci and images from lenses, geometric optics of lenses, the eye and eye-function, visual perception, color, prismatic colors, object color, chromatic aberration in lenses, the Dollond achromatic lens. The theoretical material is very concise, detailed, and mathematical; the application material is descriptive.

Ten propositions are presented and argued. 1. Light rays are not emitted from luminous bodies; 2. Rays are not themselves differently colored and heterogeneous; 3. They are not equally refractable and reflectable; 4. When mixed, they do not give white light; 5. Prismatic colors are not primitive; 6.

","A reprinting at Prague of Rudjer Bo≈°koviƒá's <i>De Lumine<i> of 1748, written while he was at the Collegio Romano. The text appeared is more than one form. The <i>Pars Prima<i> first appeared as a dissertation written by Bo≈°koviƒá but defended by (future Cardinal) Andrea Archetti in the Collegio Romano and printed in August 1748. That is the text in the present volume. The <i>Pars Secunda<i> was defended in the Collegio Romano and published anonymously in September of 1748. It also appeared at Prague in 1765. The work is a vigorous proposal and defense of the idea that light is corpuscular and subject to local, point-source attractive and repulsive forces which result in reflection, refraction, and diffraction. The <i>Dissertatio de Lumine<i> shows the earliest development and expression of Bo≈°koviƒá's ideas regarding point-source forces on (in the present case) light. These ideas would eventually be refined and developed and appear in his <i>Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis<i> of 1763. The edition of 1766 of the <i>Dissertatio De Lumine<i> is the first time both parts appeared together under  Bo≈°koviƒá's name. The volume also contains brief summaries of propositions defended at the Jesuit Seminary at Prague.","The Dissertatio de Lumine presents a view of physical optics, that is, the nature of light, which for Bo≈°koviƒá  means light as particles, moving with finite speed, subject to forces from the matter with which it interacts, and with all changes in speed and direction of propagation obeying the law of continuity. Bradley's 1727 discovery and explanation of stellar aberration supported the ideas that light is an emitted stream of particles and that is travels with a finite speed.  Using then-available data, Bo≈°koviƒá calculates the speed of light to be something close to the modern accepted value--though his calculation benefited from compensating inaccuracies of astronomical distances and times. It is here that Bo≈°koviƒá proposes extending Bradley's experiment by using a telescope filled with water and thus allowing the determine of the speed of light in water. In Pars Secunda, reflection, refraction, diffraction, and chromatic dispersion are explained in terms of light particles, traveling at finite speeds, reacting to the attractive and repulsive forces from point-sources that comprise the matter with which they interact.","The Reception of a Theory: A Provisional Syllabus of Boscovich Literature, 1746-1800|Baldini, U.|In: <i>The Jesuits II: Cultures, Sciences, and the Arts, 1540-1773<i>|O'Malley SJ, J.W., Bailey, G.A., Harris, S.J., and Kennedy SJ, T.F., editors|University of Toronto Press, 2006, pp 408-508.",Dissertationis de Lumine Part Prima Publice Propugnata in Seminario Romano Societatis Jesu.

In the 10 years since the appearance of the Latin text, achromatic telescope objects made with multiple lenses had become a practical reality. To  Bo≈°koviƒá's geometric optics and analysis of aberrations, Scherffer added work that Bo≈°koviƒá had subsequently done on achromatic lenses; most importantly, the need to accurately measure indices of refraction and chromatic dispersion.

","The most significant material added by Karl Scherffer to this German rendering was work on the achromatic telescope objective and the requirement for accurate knowledge of indices of refraction and the chromatic dispersion of different glasses. Bo≈°koviƒá was among the earlies to recognize the importance of this information and to devise instruments to make such measurements. Additional text and figures describe these developments.

The fundamental Newtonian notions of light as emitted particles and the chromatic heterogeneity of white light is adopted, but Rudjer Bo≈°koviƒá's notion of local attractive and repulsive forces acting over exceedingly small distances between atoms is used to explain the colors produced by thin and thick plates and from the surfaces of objects.

","Esprit P√©zenas's translation and augmentation of Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738. This is one of several French translations of major British works in mathematics and optics that P√©zenas produced, contributing significantly to the diffusion of English science in France. At the end of the second volume, P√©zenas added considerable material that described developments in optics made since Smith's original was published. Two French translations of Smith's work appeared in 1767: Esprit P√©zenas' being more concerned with the theoretical aspects while Duval-le-Roy's had a heavy emphasis on the practical, lens and instrument aspects. P√©zenas' translation was reviewed very positively in the Journal des S√ßavans for July, September, and December of 1767, with the December number focusing on the new material provided by P√©zenas. This translation was published at Avignon and at Paris.
","P√©zenas keeps the structure and content of Smith's original text of 1738, and though not a slavishly literal translation, it does keep closely to Smith sense and style. In addition to comments and clarifications of Smith's text throughout the translation, P√©zenas appended 'Additions du Traducteur' at the end of the second volume, totaling 127 pages and six additional plates of figures. The additions cover: 1: Experiments conducted to determine the limits of distinct and indistinct vision. 2: Why the field of view of two eyes is greater than that of one; 3: Achromatic lenses. 4: Catadioptric Sector. 5: Solar Microscope. 6: Euler's method for perfecting magic lanterns and solar microscopes. 7: A new method to very easily measure star positions. 8: Nutation of the earth's axis of rotation. 9: Movement of the sun around its axis. 10: Angle determination with a micrometer. 11: Determining the vertical diameters of the sun and planets. 12: An astronomical quadrant. Most of the additions are translations from brief articles that had appeared in journals outside France. The exception is the third on achromatic lenses, which is the longest by far and a very detailed, highly mathematical consideration of then-recent developments regarding achromatic lenses, multiple glass telescope objectives, the work done to determine their design. The work of Newton, Zucchi, Klingenstierna, Mallet, Dollond, Euler, and Clairaut are quoted or summarized.

","Nicolas Claude Duval-le-Roy's translation and augmentation of Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i> of 1738. The author and the printer desired a single-volume work, so many of Smith's historical notes were removed and the entire last section, 'Author's Remarks Upon the Whole Work' were dispersed to the various sections they addressed and set in very small type. Two French translations of Smith's work appeared in 1767: Esprit P√©zenas' being more concerned with the theoretical aspects while Duval-le-Roy's had a heavy emphasis on the practical, lens and instrument aspects.||A pre-publication review of the translation appeared in the Journal des S√ßavans for June 1766. The review is coy about the quality of the translation; spending time describing the beautiful type, the quality of the paper, and the inexpensiveness of the book. It mentions at the end that another translation by Pezenas is about to appear, but Duval-le-Roy's will be the first. There is the whiff of faint praise about the entire review.

","Duval-le-Roy's translation is, in part, a condensation of Smith's original text of 1738; preserving the essentials but not preproducing Smith's style of presentation. Duval-le-Roy updates the original is several places, the most important by far is the section on lenses, were Duval-le-Roy added material on achromatic lenses. The final result is not so much a translation of Smith's Opticks as it is an up-to-date optics text that uses Smith's original as a guide and framework.","Reading up on the Optics.

The optics material (91 pages) is in three chapters. 1 Optics: nature of light; direct, reflected, and refracted light rays; the eye, its anatomy, and eye-function; basic illumination; atmospheric refraction; practical problems using optics. 2 Catoptrics: foci and images from mirrors; plane and spherical mirrors; burning mirrors; practical problems with mirrors. 3 Dioptrics: refraction; refractive index; sine law of refraction; convex and concave lenses; foci and images from lenses; the telescope; construction and use of telescopes; the microscope; the magic lantern. The optics is that of Christian Wolff and though chromatic aberration in telescopes is mentioned, Newton's theory of light and color is not presented.

Clemm notes in his introduction that though Wolff's famed textbooks had long been in use, they had become outdated and so new texts were required that included new knowledge, however briefly (but clearly) presented. Clemm considered mathematics as the proper foundation and training for studying the other sciences--and thus the entire first volume is devoted to mathematics. Applications are found in the second volume. Interestingly, each topic is introduced with a consideration of its history. Editions appeared in 1769 and 1777.
","The first volume is devoted to mathematical fundamentals, arithmetic and geometry. The second volume covers: statics, mechanics, hydrostatics, aerometry, hydraulics, optics, catoptrics, dioptrics, perspective, theoretical and practical astronomy, geography, chronology and gnomics, civil and military architecture, and natural history. The optics material (72 pages) includes the following. Optics: history, light rays, propagation, the eye, visual perception, prismatic colors, object colors. Catoptrics: history, reflection, plane mirrors, spherical and parabolic mirrors, foci. Dioptrics: history, refraction, lenses, calculating focal length, the telescope, the microscope, other optical instruments. Each section is very brief, and though only the most elementary concepts are presented, some descriptions are accompanied by geometric demonstrations; particularly those relying on a figure for clarification.","<i>Teaching the Mathematical Sciences at French and German Universities during the 18th Century<i>|Confalonieri, S. and Kr√∂ger, D.|Cuvillier Verlag, 2016, pp 31-62.","D.

Dilettante interest in science by polite society at this time was widespread in Europe. Lectures and books that presented aspects of physics and mathematics by demonstrations, games, tricks, and instruments as entertainments were very popular. Guyot wrote directly to this audience, stating in his Discours Pr√©liminaire that he 'preferred to compose recreations that were as easy in execution as they were surprising in effect, so that those who only want recreation and have difficulty studying, can increase their understand while relaxing.' In this Guyot's Recreations are different from Ozanam's which through their many editions never lost their serious didactic purpose. Guyot's <i>Recreations<i> are simpler, more accessible, more fun. The plates of figures were hand colored. The first edition appeared in 1769-1770 in four volumes, and this second edition, enlarged from the first, appeared in four volumes in 1772, 1773, 1774, 1775. A third edition appeared at Paris in 1786, which was reprinted in  1799. Translations appeared in Dutch at Rotterdam in 1771-1775, in German at Augsburg in 1772-1775, and English at London in 1774.
","Guyot presents 'Recreations'--that is, demonstrations, phenomena, games, and instruments based on aspects of physics and mathematics. Eight parts are grouped in four volumes. Volume 1: part 1 covers magnets and their many applications; part2 covers numerical mathematics, combinations and permutations, and anagrams. Volume 2: part 3 covers geometry, light, optics, vision and perspective; part 4 covers electricity. Volume 3: part 5 coverts magnetics and new applications; part 6 coverts catoptrics and dioptrics. Volume 4: part 7 covers mechanical games, 'occult', water and fire; part 8 covers fire, phosphorous and chemistry, electricity, magic squares. The optics material in in part 6 (190 pages). There are 44 'Recreations' covering the catoptric and dioptric phenomena, instruments, perspective, and anamorphosis. The catoptric recreations include: Images in plane, convex and concave mirrors; multiple mirrors and interreflected image; anamorphosis and deformed images by deformed mirrors; conical mirrors; images in spherical mirrors. The dioptric recreations include: camera obscura; magic lanterns; images from lenses; shadows. Each recreation is presented as an entertainment based on an optical phenomenon. The presentations are purely demonstrative, with figures accompanying some of the recreations, showing the optical effect or, in some few cases, indicating how it is accomplished. There is no theory or mathematics  presented. Generally, the reader is introduced to the most basic of optical principles of reflection and refraction by way of description and a general figures. The recreations present sometimes ingenious applications of basic principles to produce visual effects.","‚ÅÇ R√©cr√©ations et math√©matiques mondaines au XVIII·µâ si√®cle: le cas de Guyot|Belhoste, B., Hazebrouck, D.|<i>Historia Mathematica<i>, Vol 41, No 4, 2014, pp 490‚Äì505.|At: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086014000779","Nouvelles reÃÅcreÃÅations physiques et matheÃÅmatiques, contenant, Toutes celles qui on √©t√© d√©couvertes  & imagin√©es dans ces dernier temps, sur l'Aiman, les Nombres, l'Optique, las Chymie, &c. & quantit√© d'autres qui n'ont jamais √©t√© rendues publiques.

Leonhard Euler,"Euler, Leonhard",,1707-1783," ",Dioptricae,"Leonhard Euler, with the help of a student, gathered his works on geometrical optics from between 1746 and 1760 and put them into textbook form: A complete text on geometric optics, his three-volume <i>Dioptricae<i>.","Leonhard Euler had been occupied with geometrical optics questions since 1746 and had published many articles in the proceedings of the Berlin and St. Petersburg academies. Beginning in the early 1760's and with the help of one of his students, Georg Wolfgang Krafft, Euler gathered his works on geometrical optics and put them into textbook form: his Dioptricae. The manuscript was completed in 1765 and the first volume published by the St. Petersburg Academy in 1769. The intent was to produce a complete text on geometric optics. Euler's goal had always been to find the necessary mathematical apparatus that would relate image quality, as limited by spherical and chromatic aberrations in lensed optical instruments, to the parameters defining the multiple lenses involved. The result was a complete analytical-mathematical apparatus for modeling optical imaging lens systems.  Elaborately mathematical, Euler's Dioptricae considers geometric optics only from an analytic point of view, independent of many important practical issues, and so produced results that were often of only the most theoretical of interests--the analysis of high-order aberrations, for example. Significantly, Euler's work was not informed by the slightly earlier work of Clairaut and d'Alembert, who considered aberrations off the optical axis of a system of lenses, and to some extent superseded Euler's work. Sixty-five years later, George Airy would write that ' . . . after a general acquaintance with the principles of chromatic dispersion, it would be easier for any one to form a theory for himself, than to select the parts that are useful from the book of Euler.' Nevertheless, Euler's Dioptricae remained important as a theoretical compendium and nearly a decade later, Georg Simon Kl√ºgel would extract from it those things that had practical application into his <i>Analytische Dioptrik<i> of 1778.
","Euler's <i>Dioptricae<i> is in three volumes. Volume 1 contains an extensive and general consideration of spherical lenses, used singly and in multiples, and the aberrations of the images they produce. Euler analyzed the indistinctness of images caused by spherical and chromatic aberration and changes in magnification. Importantly, spherical and chromatic aberrations were defined only on the optical axis of the lens(es) and the analytic process developed by Euler corrected them only on the optical axis. The only aberration considered off-axis was change in magnification. Volume 2 applies the general principles to telescopes; that is, involving the imaging and magnification of infinitely distant objects. Three telescope types are considered: with a concave ocular giving in erect image; with a convex ocular giving an inverted image; with an objective giving an erect image. An appendix describes the construction of a catadioptric telescope. Volume 3 applies the general principles to microscopes: that is, involving the imaging and magnification of very close-by objects. Simple and compound microscopes are considered, with the objectives and oculars that minimize aberrations. The style of all three volumes is the same: mathematical propositions, proofs, and corollaries followed by examples that are worked in complete numerical detail.","Leonhard Eulers Stellung in der Geschichte der Optik|Fellmann, E.A.|In: <i>Leonhard Euler 1707‚Äì1783: Beitr√§ge zu Leben und Werk<i>, Springer, 1983, pp 303-330.||Betrachtungen zu Eulers Dioptrik|Habicht, W.|In: <i>Leonhard Euler 1707‚Äì1783: Beitr√§ge zu Leben und Werk<i>, Springer, 1983, pp 283-302.||<i>Leonhard Euler: Mathematical Genius in the Enlightenment<i>|Calinger, R.S.|Princeton University Press, 2016, 696 pp, NB: pp 469-471.","Dioptricae  Pars prima: continens librum primum, de explicatione principiorum, ex quibus constructio tam telescopiorum quam microscopiorum est petenda.

Anonymous,Anonymous,,," ",Lectio Physica,"Latin manuscript of a complete course in physics
","Latin manuscript of a complete course in physics at the University of Leuven, Belgium. Placement at Leuven is supported by the plates that were signed 'C.H. Becker, Lov' and astronomical plates and tables signed 'Louvainii apud Denique.' These appear to be notes, perhaps lecture notes, for a complete course in physics in 12 sections, including mechanics, motion, gravity, astronomy, electricity, acoustics, cosmographies, mineralogy, and hydrology. Seven sections begin with an engraving (from various sources) that acts as a half-title. Many of the same plates of figures are used here as appear in another student manuscript (T.J. Lemmens, 1771) and in the anonymous university text on optics that appeared at Leuven in 1775. Unlike the other sections which use the engraved plates of Becker, the section on astronomy includes 19 hand-drawn plates (18 folding) and some colored.||The texts and their use of commercial engravings gives insight into the nature of university study at the time.
","Most of volume 2 is devoted to light, optics, and vision. The material on optics is very similar to other manuscripts produced at the same time from students at Leuven and they all use the same plates engraved by C.H. Becker. The material covers all elementary aspects of vision, geometrical, and physical optics. Sections cover  the nature and propagation of light; principles of optics; reflection and catoptrics (with headings on plane, convex, concave, and cylindrical and conical mirrors); refraction and dioptrics; diffraction, lenses and the camera obscura; vision and sight; microscopes and telescopes; and colours, and their mixing. Although the color material is Newtonian, there are citations of Descartes' <i>La Dioptrique<i> and <i>Les Meteores<i> and some of the figures are copied from Scheiner's <i>Oculus<i> of 1752.||The material is complete but descriptive, the only mathematics invoked is geometry.","<i>Cours de l'Universit√© de Louvain<i>|Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, Archives de l'Universit√©|http://archives.uclouvain.be/atom//index.php/elementa-opticae-et-perspectivae-4",Lectio Physica,Reading in Phycis,,1770,1750-1775,,MS,1770,Bookplate of Phillippe Bragard,,Leuven,,,4 Volumes,,unsigned,Only the first 79 pages of Volume 1 and the first 110 pages of Volume 4 are numbered.,"Vol 1: Plates [11] all folding; Vol 2: Plates [12] all folding; Vol 3: Plates [19] hand-drawn, Plates [3] all folding; Vol 4: Plates [5] 4 folding.",,Contemporary Marbled Calf All Edges Red,8,185,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1770 Anonymous - Lectio Physica - Images.JPG,Title Page,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1770 Anonymous - Lectio Physica - Images 2.JPG,,,,,495,,50.8822,4.7059
Karl Scherffer,"Scherffer, Karl",,1716-1783," ",Institutionum¬† Geometricarum,"Five-volume text covering mathematics through calculus, motion and equilibrium, optics, and theoretical astronomy.","Karl Scherffer had written descriptive texts on General and Particular physics  in 1750, meant for Doctor of Divinity students who did not have or need mathematics and the understanding it brought. This is a far more extensive, detailed set of texts covering mathematics through calculus, motion and equilibrium, optics, and theoretical astronomy. The order of the material, the manner of presentation, and the worked examples show that although the text made no assumptions about student-reader background, it intended to bring about a considerable development in understanding. The mechanics, optics, and astronomy material presumes the mathematics covered in the first three volumes.||Scherffer was professor of higher mathematics at Vienna for more than 30 years--and not a practicing or experimental natural philosopher. Thus, the <i>Institutiones<i> are so mathematical that the last three volumes can be considered something like modern mathematical physics. Any applied or practical aspects are absent from the presentation. Though Scherffer had 30 years earlier been a follower and teacher of Christian Wolff's natural philosophy, he introduced Newtonianism at Vienna. Sequential volumes of the texts appeared at Vienna between 1770 and 1776. 
","Volume 1: Elementary geometry, plane trigonometry, conic sections, algebra. Volume 2: Arithmetic, finite analysis, solving equations. Volume 3: Differential and integral calculus. Volume 4: Motion and equilibrium of solid bodies, motion of fluids. Volume 5: Optics. Volume 6: Spherical geometry. theoretical astronomy. Volume 7: Plates. The optics material (262 pages) in Volume 5 is in three parts. Optics: light and its effects, luminous bodies and propagation of light, speed of light from stellar aberration, heterogeneous light and prismatic colors, reflection, refraction, diffraction, phosphorus, optical principals, ocular anatomy, image formation, perception of size, distance and motion, binocular vision, consequences of linear propagation. Dioptrics: Lens refraction from near and far points, lens images, lens analysis, finding foci, telescopes, telescopic micrometers, camera obscura, magic lantern, some dioptrical problems solved, spherical aberration, spherical and chromatic aberrations compared. Catoptrics: Spherical mirrors, foci and images, mirror analysis, other mirror shapes, metamorphosis, reflection and refraction in the rainbow, lensed and mirrored telescopes, formulae for dioptric and catoptric spherical surface foci, multiple rainbows. The optics material is theoretical, advanced, and detailed; with elaborate mathematical demonstrations and worked examples.

Rudjer Josip Bo≈°koviƒá,"Bo≈°koviƒá, Rudjer Josip","Boscovich, Ruggero",1711-1787," ",Memorie sulli cannocchiali diottrici,"A reworking and updating of Boscovich's 1756 work giving a complete analysis of lenses used primarily as objectives for telescopes. The updating includes consideration of Dollond's telescope achromatic objective lens.
","The basis of this work is Boscovich's dissertation on telescope lenses of 1756. At that time he was unaware of the developments in achromatic telescope lenes presumably  from the time of his journey to France and England he learned knew about Dollond's work published in 1758. And presumably on his return journey from Constantinopole while visiting Vienna a second time, from January to May 1763, he saw Clairaut‚Äôs dissertations on achromatic lenses that had appeared in 1761 and 1762. While in Rome, towards the end of 1763, he happened upon Klingenstierna's demonstration of 1761 that contrary to Newton's assertion, achromatic lens systems were theoretically possible.||Boscovich's subsequent work on achromatic lenses was reported in his his two dissertations <i>De recentibus compertis pertinentibus ad perficiendam Dioptricam<i> and <i>De unione colorum aliorum post alios per binas substantias, ac unione multo majore per tres<i> that appeared in the Commentarii Accademia di Bologna of 1767. Since producing those two dissertations, Boscovich had become director of the new Jesuit astronomical observatory at Brera near Milan. He wrote the current work while in Milan. Boscovich's letter to the reader makes clear is intent for this work: He wished to provide convenient design methods for producing achromatic simple telescope objectives and eye-pieces. Boscovich separated the first general overview (for 'those who had only a very subtle hint of geometry') from the second part with its more rigorous demonstrations.||This dissertation describes the state of the art of telescope lens analysis and design soon after the development of the achromatic telescope objective. It is clear from this and his earlier work, that the importance of knowing the index of refraction of materials emerges as a central issue of practical optics for Boscovich. This dissertation is important in that it offers simplified lens design procedures for achromatic telescope objects as well as other off-axis aberrations. This would be that last important optical  work produced by Boscovich before the dissolution of the Jesuits in 1773 and and his move to Paris.
","A complete analysis of lenses used primarily as objectives for telescopes. The work is in two parts. The first is titled 'Elementary Information on the Nature and Principal Properties of Dioptric Telescopes'.  gives the general properties and characteristics of telescope objective lenses, defining the requirements for distinction, clarity, magnification, and field of view. The general principals are applied to the practical problem of a simple, two element objective. The second part is titled 'Clarification, and Demonstrations of Various more Essential Points from the First Part '. It consists of three sections, each giving proofs and detailed derivations or demonstrations of the components in Part One. Boscovich points out the need for achromatic eye-pieces since even for reflecting telescopes, eye-pieces will introduce chromatic aberration.||Material includes: refraction at spherical glass surfaces; real and virtual images; equations relating lens curvature and foci for convex and concave figures; equations applied to lens design, examples; spherical and chromatic aberrations and their quantification; optics of the eye and eye-function; ocular images and lenses; ocular images, lenses, and the uses of telescopes; consequences of lens aberrations and their effect on astronomical observations. Though the theoretical work of Clairaut, Klingenstierna, and Boscovich furnished the basis for designing and producing achromatic objective lenses and eyepieces, the greatest impediment, from the practical point of view, was that of the unavailability of English flint glass.","R.

Noel Antoine Pluche,"Pluche, Noel Antoine",,1688-1761," ",Spectacle de la Nature,"A vast summary and consideration of natural science and philosophy. Immensely successful in 18th century France and throughout Europe.
","One of the great works in natural history in the 18th century. Though a work of a different type and style, Pluche's <i>Le Spectacle de la Nature<i> was as widely read as Buffon's <i>Histoire Naturelle<i>. Pluche wrote the <i>Le Spectacle<i> specifically for the young; to make them aware of the world around them, its natural and man-made wonders. It is in this sense that Pluche uses <i>Spectacle<i>. As Pluche worte: People don‚Äôt know how a windmill works or a watch . . . . but they spend a lot of time on quadrille or discussing monads of Leibniz. Particularly  important is Pluche's extensive treatment of the arts and crafts and his clear commitment to increase esteem for artisans and the mechanical arts. But Pluche's work is teleological, though in a milder, more pietistic form; unlike, say, the <i>Het Regt Gebruik der Werelt Beschouwingen<i> of Bernard Nieuwentyt. Nevertheless, the teleology of the work, and Pluche's rejection of Enlightenment thought likely account for the disaffection and his relative oblivion.  Pluche nevertheless deserves credit for reviving the study of natural history in France.||The style is that of a series of dialogues and letters  between the young knight of Breuil, the count and countess Jonval, the prior of Jonval. In his Preface, Pluche says this style of presentation is far better than '... a continuous speech, or a series of dissertations which often lead to disgust & boredom.'||The printing history of <i>Le Spectacle<i> is quite tangled. The initial volume appeared in 1732 and was reissued 3 times within 6 months. The remaining 8 volumes that define the complete work appeared between 1732 and 1751. Between 1732 and 1768, various volumes of Le Spectacle de la Nature were issued in at least 18 editions. Two abridgements and translations into English, Italian, Spanish, and German also appeared. The more than 200 plates were  engraved in intaglio by Jacques-Philippe Le Bas (1707-1783).

Pluche considered the Book of Genesis, in which light was created before the sun and starts, and so held that light was one of several elementary substances--the finest and first-created of the elements and notably distinct from fire.  Pluch held that 'the nature of light is an inconceivable marvel, a true abyss in which our spirit does not play any other part than admiring and adoring.' For Pluche, light is a fluid that fills the entire universe and without changing place it transmits the actions of the sun. Light is always around us, but it has to be 'shaken' by the sun or a lamp to activate vision.","√âcrire la nature au XVIIIe si√®cle: autour de l'abb√© Pluche|Gevrey, F.|Presses de l'Universit√© Paris-Sorbonne, 2006, 406 pp.||<i>Les sciences de la nature en France, au xviii siecle.

Horvath's texts give evidence of the final ascendency of Newtonian science in the Hungarian Kingdom.
","Early editions of Horvath's physics textbook adhered closely to the earlier books of fellow Jesuits Andreas Jaszlinszky and P√°l Mak√≥. But in later editions, Horvath wrote more independently, adopted Newtonian physics fully and completely, and addressed the reader in a clearer and direct style, though adhering to a Scholastic format. The texts became the most important and widely used in Hungarian universities and appeared in other European universities due in part to their Latin, their style and emphasis on teaching, and adoption by fellow Jesuits in other schools. Editions appeared in 1767, 1769, 1770, 1772, 1775, 1776, 1782, 1817.
","The texts cover forces, mechanics, statics, motion, gravity, hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, solids, liquids, gases ('airs'), heat, light, electricity, magnetism, and celestial mechanics. The extensive section on light includes seven chapters. I: Propagation and the nature of light. II: Reflection, refraction, and diffraction. This is entirely Newtonian. III: Thin films, chromatics rings, and Newton 'fits'. IV: Transparency and Colors including the rainbow. V: Optics, vision, eye function, and perceptions. VI: Catoptrics and dioptrics. VII: Photometry.||The physical optics material is entirely Newtonian. The geometrical optics is elementary but complete. Generally, the treatment is descriptive, with mathematics no higher than geometry being used.

Joseph Priestley,"Priestley, Joseph",,1733-1804," ","The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light, and Colours","A history of optics in six parts, from Ancient Greece to 18th century optics.","Joseph Priestley was prompted to write a history of optics after the critical and commercial success of his <i>History and Present State of Electricity<i> of 1767. The bibliography appended to his history of optics lists 265 titles of books and journals he assembled for study and consultation on the history of natural philosophy in general and optics in particular. Priestley adopted a method he described in the preface: 'I  have  adopted  the historical  method,  because  it  appears  to  me  to  have many obvious advantages over any other for my purpose; being peculiarly calculate to enlarge the attention, and to communicate knowledge with the greatest ease, certainty, and pleasure.' But Priestley's history is deeply tinctured with his assessments of past work, experiments, and theories; it is not an historiographically neutral chronology. This is implied in the remarkable fold-out chronological frontispiece ('Biographical Chart'), which lists workers who, as Priestly says: 'have most distinguished themselves by their discoveries relating to vision, light and colours'. Priestley knew little mathematics, so his ability to understand, assess, and intelligently summarize optics after Descartes was quite limited. This may account for the book's prolonged descriptions and quotations from other works--making tedious reading. From this and the figures it copied it is clear that the work is derivative, but Priestley's made no greater claim: 'Neither in this volume, nor in the history of electricity, shall I be found to have made a parade of quoting any author that I have not actually consulted.' The lack of concision and of mathematics likely contributed to the books critical and commercial failure. Nevertheless, the book was an important vehicle for knowledge of optics and vision; Priestley provided English translations of many important sections of works in other languages, and detailed many important ideas in optics and vision new in the 18th century.  A German translation appeared in 1776. There would not be another book-length general history of optics written until Giambattista Venturi's <i>Commentari Sopra la Storia e le Teorie dell'Ottica<i> of 1814.
","Priestly divides his optics history in six parts. Part 1: From Ancient Greece to 1600 (30 pages). Parts 2: The telescope, microscope, and the discoveries of Kepler and his contemporaries (70 pages). Part 3: Descartes, vision, optical instruments, 17th century optical experiments. Part 4: Between Descartes and Newton, vision, reflection, refraction, diffraction (100 pages). Part 5: Newtonian optics, theory of light and colors, colors from thin and thick plates, cause of reflection and refraction, Newton's telescope (110 pages). Part 6: 18th century optics, the nature of light, phosphors, refraction and dispersion, birefringence, vision, optical instruments (420 pages). The long quotations and extracts give Priestley's history the style and tone of a commonplace book, with entries placed chronologically. Only Priestley's abiding interest in vision and optical instruments intrudes. Mathematics is avoided entirely. The geometrical optics that is presented is quoted from Smith's Compleat System of Opticks of 1738, and physical optics centers around Boscovich's theory of point elements of matter surrounded by spheres of attractive and repulsive force which is used to explain reflection and refraction.","Joseph Priestley and The History of Optics: Historiography for Science Education|Moura, B.A.|In: <i>Proceedings of the IHPST 13th Biennial International Conference<i>|IHPST, 2015|At: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/279852019_Joseph_Priestley_and_The_History_of_Optics_Historiography_for_Science_Education||<i>The Enlightened Joseph Priestley, A Study of His Life and Work from 1773 to 1804<i>|Schofield, R.E.|The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, 1997, 196 pp, NB pp 138-143.||The Scientific Background of Joseph Priestley|Schofield, R.E.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 13, No 3, 1957, pp 148-163.||Joseph Priestleys Optik in Newtons Bahnen und die Darstellung des Regenbogens|Busch, W.|In: Verfeinertes Sehen, De Gruyter Oldenbourg, 2008, 253 pp, NB: pp 79-89.","The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light, and Colours.

Dilettante interest in science by polite society at this time was widespread in Europe. Lectures and books that presented aspects of physics and mathematics by demonstrations, games, tricks, and instruments as entertainments were very popular. Guyot wrote directly to this audience, stating in his Discours Pr√©liminaire that he 'preferred to compose recreations that were as easy in execution as they were surprising in effect, so that those who only want recreation and have difficulty studying, can increase their understand while relaxing.' In this Guyot's Recreations are different from Ozanam's which through their many editions never lost their serious didactic purpose. Guyot's <i>Recreations<i> are simpler, more accessible, more fun. The plates of figures were hand colored. The first edition appeared in 1769-1770 in four volumes, and this second edition, enlarged from the first, appeared in four volumes in 1772, 1773, 1774, 1775. A third edition appeared at Paris in 1786, which was reprinted in  1799. Translations appeared in Dutch at Rotterdam in 1771-1775, in German at Augsburg in 1772-1775, and English at London in 1774.
","Guyot presents 'Recreations'--that is, demonstrations, phenomena, games, and instruments based on aspects of physics and mathematics. Eight parts are grouped in four volumes. Volume 1: part 1 covers magnets and their many applications; part2 covers numerical mathematics, combinations and permutations, and anagrams. Volume 2: part 3 covers geometry, light, optics, vision and perspective; part 4 covers electricity. Volume 3: part 5 coverts magnetics and new applications; part 6 coverts catoptrics and dioptrics. Volume 4: part 7 covers mechanical games, 'occult', water and fire; part 8 covers fire, phosphorous and chemistry, electricity, magic squares. The optics material in in part 6 (190 pages). There are 44 'Recreations' covering the catoptric and dioptric phenomena, instruments, perspective, and anamorphosis. The catoptric recreations include: Images in plane, convex and concave mirrors; multiple mirrors and interreflected image; anamorphosis and deformed images by deformed mirrors; conical mirrors; images in spherical mirrors. The dioptric recreations include: camera obscura; magic lanterns; images from lenses; shadows. Each recreation is presented as an entertainment based on an optical phenomenon. The presentations are purely demonstrative, with figures accompanying some of the recreations, showing the optical effect or, in some few cases, indicating how it is accomplished. There is no theory or mathematics  presented. Generally, the reader is introduced to the most basic of optical principles of reflection and refraction by way of description and a general figures. The recreations present sometimes ingenious applications of basic principles to produce visual effects.","‚ÅÇ R√©cr√©ations et math√©matiques mondaines au XVIII·µâ si√®cle: le cas de Guyot|Belhoste, B., Hazebrouck, D.|<i>Historia Mathematica<i>, Vol 41, No 4, 2014, pp 490‚Äì505.|At: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086014000779","Nouvelles reÃÅcreÃÅations physiques et matheÃÅmatiques, contenant ce qui a eÃÅteÃÅ imagineÃÅ de plus curieux dans ce genre et ce qui se deÃÅcouvre journellement; Auxquelles on a joint les causes, leurs effets, la manieÃÄre de les construire et l'amusement qu'on en peut tirer pour eÃÅtonner et surprendre agreÃÅablement.

Johann Friedrich Hennert,"Hennert, Johann Friedrich",,1733-1813," ",Les Moyens de Donner la plus Grande Perfection Possible aux Lunettes,A mathematical analysis of the achromatic doublet lens as advanced by Dollond.,"In response to the Berlin Academy's announcement of an essay prize, Hennert planed a work to present the development of practical mathematical procedures to design achromatic doublet objective lenses that also minimized spherical aberration. He wrote that most craftsman and oculists were 'copying as blind workmen what once was prescribed' because they lacked the methods to make improvements.","The text begins with a summary of then-recent work in the analysis of chromatic aberration, the researchers involved, and the mathematics that had been developed as a basis for lens design. Hennert believes there is still a lack of practical mathematical tools. Following this are five articles devoted to the development of lens design tools. 1: The four qualities of good lenses, 2: The aberrations that affect lenses, particularly chromatic and spherical aberration, 3: The aberration of objects placed off-axis of the lens, 4: Glass for lenses, and 5: Application of the preceding developments to the construction of different types of lenses. Hennert limits his analysis to the use of Crown and Flint glass--as did Dollond in his commercial lenses--but considers chromatic and geometric aberrations on and off the optical axis. He also restricts his analysis to doublets, claiming 'All opticians agree in a preference for doublet objectives.'||Hennert's work is experiment and mathematics based; striving to give the craftsman a clear idea of analyses and how they are used for designing lenses. Examples are used throughout, especially in the last article where very detailed examples are given.","The Early Development of the Achromatic Telescope Revisited|Zuidervaart, H., Cocquyt, T.|<i>Nuncius<i>, Vol 33, No 2, 2018, pp 265-344,","Dissertation sur les Moyens de Donner la plus Grande Perfection Possible aux Lunettes dont les Objectifs sont Compos√©s de Deux Matieres, qui a report√© le prix propos√© par L'Academie Royale des Sciences et Belles-Lettres for l'annee MDCCLXXI, adjug√© en MDCCLCCII.

From this he developed his theory of perspective, which he then used to describe and prove the correctness of a number of constructions. The application of the theory to constructions--that is, particular physical settings--is particularly elaborate. This included an application to sundials.

Joseph Harris,"Harris, Joseph",,1702-1764," ",Treatise of Optics,"A posthumously published work, from the manuscript collected by Harris‚Äôs friends, on optics, vision, and visual perception.","A posthumously published work on optics, vision, and visual perception. Harris‚Äôs Treatise started life as a book on microscopes in 1742, but work as assay master to the Mint likely left little time to compete it. After his death in 1764 his friends collected the manuscript and arranged for its publication 11 years later. Harris's text treats optics very briefly and concisely, and vision extensively. It is particularly important for its sections on vision and visual perception, where Harris refutes Berkeley's attack on visual perception based on geometry. Harris's is one of the few English texts in the 18th century devoted solely to optics. The list of such texts is short; in addition to that of Harris there is: Smith in 1738, Benjamin Martin in 1740 and 1758, William Emerson in 1768, Higgins in 1776, and Woods in 1799.
","The treatise is In two books. Book 1: Properties of light, reflection and refraction at plane surfaces, reflection and refraction at spherical surfaces, lenses, lens foci, lens images, chromatic dispersion. Book 2: The eye, limits of distinct vision, near and far-sightedness, images from plane and spherical mirrors, images from lenses, camera obscura. The optics material is a march or axioms, propositions, demonstrations, and corollaries--all of extreme concision. The material on the nature of light and color is Newtonian, and that on geometrical optics is detailed and mathematical with figures in the style of Smith's Compleat System of Optics of 1738. The material on the eye and vision is more extensive and detailed, particularly regarding the eye and visual perception. The sizes of the optical structures of the eye are given, as well as the size of the visual field, and reports of experiments Harris conducted on the limits of distinct vision off the visual axis. The section on visual perception defends a geometrical basis for perceptions of size, distance, and orientation, emphasizing the role of experience in perception--all contrary to Berkeley. The material on vision is also accompanied by long footnotes that amount to glosses on the main text.","Image, eye, and retina|Wade, N.J.|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i> A, Vol 24, No 5, 2007, pp 1229-1249.||Berkeley, Reid, and the Mathematization of Mid-Eighteenth-Century Optics|Cantor, G.N.|<i>Journal of the History of Ideas<i>, Vol 38, No 3, 1977, pp. 429-448.||Perception in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries|Wade, N.J.|In: <i>Perception and Illusion: Historical Perspectives<i>|Springer, 2005, pp 78-79.","Treatise of Optics: Containing Elements of the Science; in Two Books.

","While he was teaching at the University of B√ºtzow, Wenceslaus Karsten began work on what would become his eight-part textbook on mathematics and natural philosophy. From his correspondence it is known that Karsten was charged with teaching mixed mathematics under very difficult conditions; students at B√ºtzow were many different courses of study, with little interest and no background in mathematics or natural philosophy. These texts were written in German, expressly for these students, since the provincial university at B√ºtzow drew few well-prepared students and neither university nor student could afford textbooks. Beginning in 1770 Karsten was in correspondence with Johann Heinrich Lambert and as a favor to Karsten, Lambert reviewed several sections as Karsten completed them. In 1778 Karsten moved to the University of Halle where he worked on the second edition of this textbook set. The first edition appeared between 1767 and 1777, and a second edition of the first six parts appeared between 1782 and 1790.

Part 4: Mechanics of rigid bodies. Part 5: Hydraulics. Part 6: Hydraulics and Pneumatics. Part 7: Optics and Perspective. Part 8: Photometry. The optics material (109 pages of Part 7) has the general heading: General theory of light and shadow, the appearance of size, shape, and movement of objects, as perceived by the eye. Virtually all of the material is a presentation of a strictly geometric basis for visual perception. The eight sections are: Preliminary consideration of some features of light; Visual angle and appearances; Apparent form of remote objects; Apparent position of distant objects; Apparent movement; Phenomena causing the progressive propagation of light; Shadow and semi-shade; Sunlight in particular.","Wenceslaus Johann Gustav Karsten (1732‚Äì1787): Von Neubrandenburg nach Halle ‚Äì Bewerbungen, Beziehungen, Berufungen|Schmidt, W.H.|<i>Martin‚ÄìLuther‚ÄìUniversit√§t Halle‚ÄìWittenberg, Reports on Didactics and History of Mathematics<i>, No 2, 2004, 33 pp.|http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/serien/e/reports_Halle-Wittenberg_math/04-02report.pdf||German Physics Textbooks in the <i>Goethezeit<i>, Part 1 and Part 2|Clark, W.|<i>History of Science<i>, Vo.l 35, No 2, 3 1997, pp 219-239, 297-263.","Lehrbegriff der gesamten Mathematik.

The book appears to be an optics and perspective text for Leuven University students with no background. It presents the elementary aspects of optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics and demonstrates them in simple applications, instruments, and experiments. An extant student manuscript titled Tractatus de Lumine is accompanied by plates of figures etched by C.H. Becker are nearly identical to those in the printed book; the earliest of these is dated 1766. Becker was also the engraver for the plates used in the 1775 printed text. The manuscript text is similar to the printed text and are from a course given at Louvain by  Ignatius Damas of Dinant. Apparently, the course and its text were in active use at the university for at least a decade before the printed text was produced. A similar student manuscript dated 1770 is in the Smithsonian.
","The optics material (155 pages) is in five sections. Section 1: fundamental optical principles, properties of light, shadow, nature and propagation of light, vision. Section 2: Catoptric principles; plane, spherical, cylindrical, and conic mirrors. Section 3: Dioptric principles; refraction a plane and spherical surfaces. Section 4: The eye, distinct vision, myopia and hyperopia, 'artificial eye', Newtonian prismatic colors, the rainbow. Section 5: The simple and compound microscope,  the astronomical and terrestrial telescope, cata-dioptric telescope, achromatic telescope, magic lantern.

Spengler mentions visiting the great Augsburg instrument maker Georg Brander to examine his microscopes. Some of Spengler's figures are taken from Brander's literature.
","The material is in two parts: Theoretical and Practical. The Theoretical part is in four sections. I: general properties of light, reflection, refraction, focal points, light and color.  II: catoptrics, focal points from mirrors, their calculation, images from mirrors. III: dioptrics, focal points from simple refraction, focal points from double refraction, lenses, their calculation.

"Johann Baptiste Horvath, SJ","Horvath, Johann Baptiste SJ",,1732-1799," ",Physica Generalis,"The fourth and most complete edition of Johann Horvath's physics textbooks, <i>Physica Generalis et Particularis<i> and first in quarto size. Horvath's texts give evidence of the final ascendency of Newtonian science in the Hungarian Kingdom.
","Early editions of Horvath's physics textbook adhered closely to the earlier books of fellow Jesuits Andreas Jaszlinszky and P√°l Mak√≥. But in later editions, Horvath wrote more independently, adopted Newtonian physics fully and completely, and addressed the reader in a clearer and direct style, though adhering to a Scholastic format. The texts became the most important and widely used in Hungarian universities and appeared in other European universities due in part to their Latin, their style and emphasis on teaching, and adoption by fellow Jesuits in other schools. Editions appeared in 1767, 1769, 1770, 1772, 1775, 1776, 1782, 1817.
","The texts cover forces, mechanics, statics, motion, gravity, hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, solids, liquids, gases ('airs'), heat, light, electricity, magnetism, and celestial mechanics. The extensive section on light includes seven chapters. I: Propagation and the nature of light. II: Reflection, refraction, and diffraction. This is entirely Newtonian. III: Thin films, chromatics rings, and Newton 'fits'. IV: Transparency and Colors including the rainbow. V: Optics, vision, eye function, and perceptions. VI: Catoptrics and dioptrics. VII: Photometry.||The physical optics material is entirely Newtonian. The geometrical optics is elementary but complete.

Joseph Priestley,"Priestley, Joseph",,1733-1804,"Edited by Georg Simon Kl√ºgel (1739 - 1812) German mathematician, natural philosopher. Student of K√§stner, Professor at the Universities of Helmstedt and Halle",Geschichte und gegenwaÃàrtiger Zustand der Optik (a),"Georg Simon Kl√ºgel's German translation and augmentation of Joseph Priestley's history of optics in six parts, from Ancient Greece to 18th century optics.
","Joseph Priestley was prompted to write a history of optics after the critical and commercial success of his <i>History and Present State of Electricity<i> of 1767. The bibliography appended to his history of optics lists 265 titles of books and journals he assembled for study and consultation on the history of natural philosophy in general and optics in particular. Priestley adopted a method he described in the preface: 'I  have  adopted  the historical  method,  because  it  appears  to  me  to  have many obvious advantages over any other for my purpose; being peculiarly calculate to enlarge the attention, and to communicate knowledge with the greatest ease, certainty, and pleasure.' But Priestley's history is deeply tinctured with his assessments of past work, experiments, and theories; it is not an hitoriographically neutral chronology. This is implied in the remarkable fold-out chronological frontispiece ('Biographical Chart'), which lists workers who, as Priestly says: 'have most distinguished themselves by their discoveries relating to vision, light and colours'. Priestley knew little mathematics, so his ability to understand, assess, and intelligently summarize optics after Descartes was quite limited. This may account for the book's prolonged descriptions and quotations from other works--making tedious reading. From this and the figures it copied it is clear that the work is derivative, but Priestley's made no greater claim: 'Neither in this volume, nor in the history of electricity, shall I be found to have made a parade of quoting any author that I have not actually consulted.' The lack of concision and of mathematics likely contributed to the books critical and commercial failure. Nevertheless, the book was an important vehicle for knowledge of optics and vision; Priestley provided English translations of many important sections of works in other languages, and detailed many important ideas in optics and vision new in the 18th century.  A German translation appeared in 1776. There would not be another book-length general history of optics written until Giambattista Venturi's <i>Commentari Sopra la Storia e le Teorie dell'Ottica<i> of 1814.||Kl√ºgel makes clear his reasons for translating Priestley's work: It is the only generally available text that presents and optics history and, with a few exceptions, presents the most important ideas and authors. Kl√ºgel notes that Priestley is shy with his mathematics and that when it was thought necessary, it has been added or corrected. Kl√ºgel substitutes Johann Lambert's history of perspective for that of Priestley's and notes that he has reduced the number of figures in the final German text in order to make it more practical. Kl√ºgel marks his additions and corrections with an asterisk in the German text.
","Kl√ºgel translates Priestley's Preface and generally  produces a close translation, clearly marking his own changes. Priestly divides his optics history in six parts. Part 1: From Ancient Greece to 1600 (30 pages). Parts 2: The telescope, microscope, and the discoveries of Kepler and his contemporaries (70 pages). Part 3: Descartes, vision, optical instruments, 17th century optical experiments. Part 4: Between Descartes and Newton, vision, reflection, refraction, diffraction (100 pages). Part 5: Newtonian optics, theory of light and colors, colors from thin and thick plates, cause of reflection and refraction, Newton's telescope (110 pages). Part 6: 18th century optics, the nature of light, phosphors, refraction and dispersion, birefringence, vision, optical instruments (420 pages). The long quotations and extracts give Priestley's history the style and tone of a commonplace book, with entries placed chronologically. Only Priestley's abiding interest in vision and optical instruments intrudes. Mathematics is avoided entirely. The geometrical optics that is presented is quoted from Smith's Compleat System of Opticks of 1738, and physical optics centers around Boscovich's theory of point elements of matter surrounded by spheres of attractive and repulsive force which is used to explain reflection and refraction.||Kl√ºgel's work included editing, clarifying, and augmenting some of Priestley's more technical and less correct sections. These are either added notes or sections marked with an asterisk. Kl√ºgel also added a considerable section devoted to Johann Heinrich Lambert's Photometria of 1760; a book which Priestley knew of but claimed not to be able to acquire.","Joseph Priestley and The History of Optics: Historiography for Science Education|Moura, B.A.|In: <i>Proceedings of the IHPST 13th Biennial International Conference<i>|IHPST, 2015|At: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/279852019_Joseph_Priestley_and_The_History_of_Optics_Historiography_for_Science_Education||<i>The Enlightened Joseph Priestley, A Study of His Life and Work from 1773 to 1804<i>|Schofield, R.E.|The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, 1997, 196 pp, NB pp 138-143.||The Scientific Background of Joseph Priestley|Schofield, R.E.|<i>Annals of Science<i>, Vol 13, No 3, 1957, pp 148-163.||Joseph Priestleys Optik in Newtons Bahnen und die Darstellung des Regenbogens|Busch, W.|In: Verfeinertes Sehen, De Gruyter Oldenbourg, 2008, 253 pp, NB: pp 79-89.","Dr. Joseph Priestlys Mitglied der KoÃànigl.

It was notable for its complete reliance on experiment and demonstration.","Joseph-Aignan Sigaud de Lafond was a student of Abbe Jean-Antoine Nollet and after Nollet's death succeeded him at the Coll√®ge Louis-le-Grand. He had acquired a deep understanding of the pedagogy of natural philosophy suitable for general audiences. The expulsion of the Jesuit from France in 1764 created an educational vacuum and Sigaud de Lafond began public lecturing and demonstrations. He assembled a famous experimental physics cabinet and in 1775 published a description of its contents and use. All of this was brought together in his four-volume survey of experimental natural philosophy published in 1777. It was notable for its complete reliance on experiment and demonstration, responding not only to the changing philosophical approach by professionals but also increased interest on the part of the public. Editions appeared in 1777 and 1787.

Written both as a text for students and as a guide to teachers for a course in optics.","The unnamed author of this work is Thomas Kipling (1748-1822), Fellow at Trinity College Cambridge and Senior Wrangler in mathematics in 1768. In his Preface he explains the need for a text on optics suitable for tutor use in universities. Smith's <i>A Compleat System of Opticks<i>, printed only once in 1738 in a relatively small quantity, had long been unavailable. The only optics texts in English available at the time were those of Emerson and Harris. The former was judged too advanced and mathematical, the latter missing important topics. Kipling was guided by the topics in Smith's work, amended by recent developments and his own and other tutor's notes from the optics courses they taught. The result was a modest work of just over 100 pages, affordable and accessible by most students, and perhaps more importantly, serviceable as a guide to teachers for a course in optics. The 6 pages of subscribers make it clear how well the author judged the need and want for such a summary of optical principles.
","The material is presented in 14 chapters. 1: nature and propagation of light. 2: color. 3: Refraction, reflection, diffraction and emission of light, and their causes. 4: Refraction of a ray at a plane, prism, or spherical lens. 5: Calculation of the focus from a mirror. 6: Images from mirrors. 7: Calculation of the focus of parallel rays refraction incident on a plane or spherical lens. 8: Images from lenses. 9: The eye and eye-function. 10: Spectacles. 11: Calculation of spherical and chromatic aberration of lenses. 12: Examples of refracting and reflecting telescopes; construction details. 13: The rainbow. 14: Telescopic discoveries in the start. As with Smith's text, the physical optics and the theory of light and color is entirely Newtonian. The geometrical optics is as detailed as that in Smith's text; the cases and conditions are fewer, but the explanations are more extended, detailed, and more accessible.","‚ÅÇ  Reading up on the Optics.

Jean-Paul Marat,"Marat, Jean-Paul",,1743-1793," ",DeÃÅcouvertes de M. Marat,"An extended brochure summarizing Marat's experimental results involving heat, electricity, and light. Appropriate experiments are cited in support of each claim made about the nature of light and heat.","This is the first scientific work Jean-Paul Marat published after his return to France from 11-year stay in England in 1776. Marat held that fire, light, and electricity were the manifestation of an elemental fiery fluid and conducted many experiments between 1777 and 1779  involving heat, electricity, and light. A report of Marat's work was presented to the French Academie Royale des Sciences with a positive response. Encouraged by this, Marat immediately wove his experimental results into a text, with the appropriate experiment cited in support of each claim, and had it published as this extended brochure. The title states it is the second edition, but it is actually a reprinting of the first edition which appeared earlier that same year. The wording in the title page regarding the status of the experiments is changed slightly ('experiments that have just been verified' to 'experiments that have been verified') and the text has been corrected by Marat in a few places. 
","Marat hypothesized that electrical phenomena were manifestations of an electrical fluid, that heat was an igneous fluid, and light a luminous fluid. The text weaves together 116 experiments demonstrating the nature of these fluids and their interaction. The most striking was a large objective lens admitting solar light into a camera obscura. Flames and heated objects were placed in the beam and projected images onto a distant wall. The optical inhomogeneities caused in the air were seen rising from any object placed in the beam's path. The following year Marat would publish another optical work with an etching depicting this--the first representation of what is now known as Schlieren.","Public Experiments and their Analysis with the Replication Method|Herring, P.|<i>Science & Education<i>, Vol 16, No 6, 2007, pp 637-645.||Du Marat In√©dit|Gottschalk, L.R., Connes, M.G.|<i>Annales historiques de la R√©volution francaise<i>, No 15, 1926, pp 209-216.||<i>Isaac Newton, Optique, Traduit de l‚Äôanglais par Jean-Paul Marat (1787)<i>|Blay, M.|Dunod, Paris, 2015, p 375, NB pp 50-69.||Jean-Paul Marat (1743-1793), cientista e tradutor de Newton|Tosi, L.|<i>Qu√≠mica Nova<i>, Vol 22, No 6, 1999, pp 907-912.|","DeÃÅcouvertes de M.

Jean-Paul Marat,"Marat, Jean-Paul",,1743 -1793," ",DeÃÅcouvertes De M. Marat,"Marat's second work reporting experimental results involving light, on which basis he rejected Newtonian optics with its theory of the heterogeneity of white light. ","Jean-Paul Marat followed the initial success and positive reception by the French Academie Royale des Sciences of his heat, light, and electricity experiments of 1779, with a more extensive set of experiments devoted exclusively to light. As with the earlier work, he wove together his experimental results with commentary to produce this text. He interpreted the results as requiring a rejection of Newtonian optics with its theory of the heterogeneity of white light and the nature of reflection, refraction, and diffraction. In its place was a fluid undergoing attractive interaction with objects around which it moved. Marat felt he was correcting Newton's theory of light and color and submitted a report to the Academie. It was rejected and Marat appended the report along with his comments at the end of this work. A German translation appeared at Leipzig in 1783.
","Jean-Paul Marat's text describes the principle apparatus for his light experiments: a 'helioscope' that consisted of a large objective lens capable of creating large images on a distance wall in an otherwise darkened room. He interpreted the colors surrounding the weak shadows of prisms and spheres as the result of a kind of diffraction, a deflection of light's path as it passed close to the object. Marat held that this was the cause of color separation produced by prisms and thin films, not differing refraction or interference as Newton claimed.","Public Experiments and their Analysis with the Replication Method|Herring, P.|<i>Science & Education<i>, Vol 16, No 6, 2007, pp 637-645.||Du Marat In√©dit|Gottschalk, L.R., Connes, M.G.|<i>Annales historiques de la R√©volution francaise<i>, No 15, 1926, pp 209-216.||<i>Isaac Newton, Optique, Traduit de l‚Äôanglais par Jean-Paul Marat (1787)<i>|Blay, M.|Dunod, Paris, 2015, p 375, NB pp 50-69.||Jean-Paul Marat (1743-1793), cientista e tradutor de Newton|Tosi, L.|<i>Qu√≠mica Nova<i>, Vol 22, No 6, 1999, pp 907-912.|","DeÃÅcouvertes De M.

"Claude Etienne Baron de; & Goussier, Louis Jacques Marivetz","Marivetz, Claude Etienne Baron de; & Goussier, Louis Jacques",,1728-1794; 1722-1799," ",Physique du monde,"A five-volume, multiple-part overview of the physics of motion, light, heat, electricity, magnetism, and chemical transformation. All physical phenomena were explained by aether motion producing attractions and repulsion, usually in the form of vortices scaled either to move the planets or the tiniest bits of matter.","In 1779 Claude Etienne Baron de Marivetz and  Louis Jacques Goussier announced plans to produce a general theory of physical geography derived from fundamental principles--which meant the physics of motion, light, heat, electricity, magnetism, and chemical transformation. Seven parts in five volumes of <i>Physique de Monde<i> appeared from 1780 to 1787 before the project came to an end, having consumed much of de Marivetz's fortune but never having reached the point of applying basic physics to geography. The system of physics presented Marivetz and Goussier rests entirely on a universal, all-pervading aether and its motion. All physical phenomena were explained by aether motion producing attractions and repulsion, usually in the form of vortices scaled either to move the planets or the tiniest bits of matter. Though their system was essentially Cartesian, Marivetz and Goussier insisted it was new. The work is remarkable for its extended consideration of the history of contributions from eminent authors and so provides a late 18th century view of the history of physics. The work is also remarkable for the large and numerous plates, particularly for the material dealing with light, often hand colored. The drawing for these and much of the technical material in <i>Physique du Monde<i> was produced by Goussier--having produced the drawings for nearly one-third of the plates in Diderot's <i>Encyclop√©die<i>. Notices and reviews of  <i>Physique du Monde<i> appeared in Journal des S√ßavans, Journal encyclop√©dique, L‚ÄôAnn√©e litt√©raire, Observations sur la physique, Mercure de France, and the London Monthly Review. But, as the conspicuous official silence of the  French Academie Royale des Sciences suggests, the ideas of Marivetz never entered mainstream French science. The rarity of copies of <i>Physique du Monde<i> is probably because upon Marivetz's execution in 1794 during the French Terror, unsold copies in the bookseller's and Marivetz's home were confiscated and the paper used for wrapping and munitions manufacture.
","Given the scope of what Marivtez and Goussier covered (and intended to cover) in <i>Physique du Monde<i>, 'Monde' is best understood as 'Universe.' The five tomes have contents as follows.  Tome 1: Cosmogony and history of theories; extended extracts from Buffon's system of cosmogony. Tome 2 Part 1: Space and the universal aether; the solar system; comets; the stars; vortices in the aether; nine propositions on vortices and motion in the solar system; density and weight. Tome 2 Part 2: Explanation of the plates. Tome 2 part 3: Tables of data on planetary orbits, vocabulary. Tome 3: Light and vision. Tome 4 Part 1: Various philosophical considerations, vision, color. Tome 4 Part 2: Theory of color. Tome 5 Part 1: Concerning fire. Tome 5 Part 2: Chemistry; chemistry and fire; chemistry and light; fire and light. Tome 5 Part 3: Theory of fire; heat; combustion and vitrification; transmutation of metals; various observations. The material on light and optics comprises all of Tome 3 (365 pages); that on vision, visual perception, and color is all of Tome 4 (544 pages); and that on phosphors, light sources, and light from hear is part of Tome 5 part 2 (90 pages). The entire theory and all its manifestations rests on the hypothesis that light is movement or tendency to movement in the universal aether. Reflection, refraction, and diffraction are caused by the aether's interaction with objects; Newton's theory of light and color is rejected. All sections dealing with light and vision contain extensive reviews of history and considerations of alternative theories. But even at this late date, the central argument is for an advanced form of a Cartesian theory of light and is ultimately mechanical rather than ballistic.","Marivetz, Goussier, and Planet Earth: A Late Enlightenment Geo-Physical Project|Taylor, K.L.|<i>Centaurus<i>, Vol 48, No 4, 2006, pp 258‚Äì283.","Physique du monde, deÃÅdieÃÅ au Roi; Par M.

He held a chair of mathematics at Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), an institution devoted to the teaching of painting, sculpture, and architecture. The expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain created both an educational vacuum and opportunity. Renewed interest in Spanish texts written expressly for university student use resulted in Bails being commissioned to produce 'a great treatise of mathematics.' It was not intended that Bails produce an original work; rather (and expressly stated) he was charged with translating and summarizing the best contemporary European works. The result far exceeded the Academy's expectations, or even its need. Among other achievements, Bails introduced the Calculus into university education in Spain. Bails also produced the <i>Principios de Matem√°ticas<i>, a more concise and elementary 3-volume version in 1776. Both the <i>Elementos de Matematica<i> and the <i>Principios de Matem√°ticas<i> were widely used until the middle of the 19th century in Spain and in Latin American schools.||Though work on the early volumes of the first edition were was finished in 1772, they did not appear in commerce until 1779. The first edition appeared between 1779 and 1783. A second, slightly revised edition appeared between 1790 and 1793.
","Tome 6 of Benito Bails survey of Mixed Mathematics is devoted exclusively to optics, including the following. Optics: nature of light, propagation, illumination, reflection, refraction, atmospheric refraction, photometry, burning mirrors. Catoptrics: Reflected rays and their calculation, reflected images, calculation of foci of various mirrors, reflected caustics. Dioptrics: Refracted rays, calculation of foci of lenses, refracted images, determining focus of oblique rays, chromatic aberration of spherical lenses.  The Eye and Vision: Ocular anatomy, eye-function, view and perception. Optical Instruments: spectacles, camera obscura, magic lantern, common glasses, simple and compound microscope, solar microscope, perfecting the magic lantern and the solar microscope, astronomical glasses. The Telescope and its Use: Calculating the focus of rays through any number of lenses, catadioptric telescope, theory of aberrations applied to microscopes and telescopes, images from catadioptric instruments, achromatic lenses. Practical Optics: Figuring lenses, polishing dishes, choosing glass, preparation before figuring and polishing, cutting lenses, polishing lenses, melting, forming and polishing lenses for telescopes, centering the objective lens.  The material is extensive, detailed, both theoretical and practical, and analytic. The work is particularly important as complete summary of all aspects of optics current at the time and considered important for study at the university.","Construyendo la modernidad: Nuevos datos y enfoques sobre la introducci√≥n del C√°lculo Infinitesimal en Espa√±a (1717-1787)|Ausejo, E., Sanches, F.J.M.|<i>Llull: Revista de la Sociedad Espa√±ola de Historia de las Ciencias y de las T√©cnicas<i>, Vol 33, 2010, pp 25-56.||Mathematics Education in Spain and Portugal|Ausejo, E., Matos, J.M.|In:  <i>Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education<i>, Springer, 2014, pp 283-302.","Elementos De Matematica.

Fossombroni appears to be unaware of Lambert's <i>Photometria<i> of 1760 that deals with the elementary aspects of the same subject but far more elaborately.
","The work opens with a long <i>Discorso Preliminaire<i> in which the advances made in mathematics, particularly algebra and calculus, are outlined and how they can be applied to problems in physics. The main body of the work begins with general principles being presented: Defining light sources and giving the inverse-square of distance relationship for incident light density. The general principles are used to solve eight problems with increasingly complex geometric settings and are essentially geometric-computational problems, solved with algebra and calculus. Fossombroni problems involve point light sources and lines or surface over which minimum or maximum illuminance is to be found, or finding equations for surfaces of uniform illuminance. The eight problems presented showcase Fossombroni's power as a mathematician.","Considerazioni sul Saggio di ricerca sull‚Äôintensit√† del lume di Vittorio Fossombroni|Bruni, B.|In: Societ√† Italiana degli Storici della Fisica e dell Astronomia: Atti del XXXV Convegno annuale; Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference, Arezzo 2015|Esposito, S., editor|Pavia University Press, 2016, pp 3-13.","Saggio de ricerche sull'intensita del lume, di Vittorio Fossombroni Aretino.

The intent is to deduce the causes of colored shadows, and from those the nature of light and color. The author is listed only as H.F.T., but the work has been attributed to Jean-Henri Hassenfratz. It is referenced in Part Three of the 1790 edition of Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler's <i>Physikalisches W√∂rterbuch<i> in the article on Shadows. And, more importantly, this in turn is referenced by Georg-Christof Lichtenberg in one of his letters to Johann Goethe in response to a copy of the 1793 <i>Beitr√§ge zur Optik<i> Goethe had sent him. Lichtenberg was a confirmed Newtonian and was gently urging  Goethe to consider alternatives to the theory in the <i>Beitr√§ge zur Optik<i>. Lichtenberg urged Goethe to get a copy of the book and study the many experiments is presented, since he was certain that the book presented ideas similar to and seemingly in support of Goethe's theory, but was subject to the same reservations that Lichtenberg presented (carefully and with due respect!) regarding Goethe's theory. Goethe did study Hassenfratz's book; he presents a summary of it in the history section of <i>Farbenlehre<i> of 1809 and credits Hassenfratz with the idea of complementary colors.
","The material is presented in three parts, I: Conditions necessary to produce colored shadows. II: Different methods of producing colored shadows. III: The cause of colored shadows. Shadows of different colors are produced from the sun, from the sun and sky, from just the sky, from artificial sources, from artificial sources and the sky, from artificial sources and the full moon. In all, 92 experiments are described involving the production, observation and assessment of colored shadows and the implications of their results for the theory of light and color.

The precise measurement of angular size, position, and separation was important in late 18th century for surveying, navigating, and astronomical work. A common method for determining longitude was the measurement of star position with respect to the moon, or the eclipses of the moons of Jupiter. Rochon ingeniously used birefringent crystals,  prisms, and mirrors to significantly extend the measurement range and improvement of accuracy of optical instruments in navigating and astronomy.
","The collection of memoires include the following. A new micrometer for objective lenses. Essay on the measure of small angles and the research on the achromatic lens.

This is the 'painful idleness that had consumed almost two years of my life' he refers to in his preface, where he describes the occasion for writing this book on the nature of light, its properties, and its effect. It is not that the book is strange; rather it is strange that Linguet should write it. A caustic journalist, provocateur, archconservative, and opponent of the Enlightenment, Linguet seems an unlikely author of a work to reconsider the long and otherwise long-ended debate between the Cartesian and Newtonian conceptions of light. But as the title makes clear, this is not presented as experimental natural philosophy but a set of reflections and conjectures about what light is and what it does, based on the work of Descartes and Newton.

","Marat begins with a brief summary of basic optical phenomena: linear propagation of rays, reflection and refraction, convergence and divergence, chromatic inhomogeneity, diffraction. Adding to catoptrics and dioptrics, Marat adds the neologisms 'peroptrics' and 'opisoptrics' to describe propagation direction change close to an object and change caused by moving into a different medium. The text deals with 'peroptrics' and how light is attracted to near-by bodies and therefore deviated from an otherwise rectilinear path. This, claims Marat, is the explanation for the results obtained by Newton in his experiments, and not refraction as he claimed. The text presents several experiments with results that are interpreted to support Marat's theory. A final section 'Essential Observations' lists the apparatus required to perform the experiments and how they are to be arranged.","<i>Isaac Newton, Optique, Traduit de l‚Äôanglais par Jean-Paul Marat (1787)<i>|Blay, M.|Dunod, Paris, 2015, p 375, NB pp 50-69.||Jean-Paul Marat (1743-1793), cientista e tradutor de Newton|Tosi, L.|<i>Qu√≠mica Nova<i>, Vol 22, No 6, 1999, pp 907-912.|",Notions elementaires d'optique,Elementary Ntions of Optics.,,1784,1775-1800,"French physician, natural philosopher, radical journalist.",1,1784,Bookplate of Pierre Amalric,Pierre Francois Didot and Nicolas-Leger Moutard,Paris,,,,,œÄ¬π a¬≤ A-B‚Å∏ C‚Å∂ D¬≤,[ùüû] [1] 2-44 [v] vi-vii [ùüô],Plates [I-II],,Contemporary Marbled Paper Wrappers,8,195,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1784 Marat - Notions elementaires d'optique - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6213679b.r=%22Notions%20elementaires%20d%27optique%22?rk=21459;2,540,Librairie Alain Brieux,48.8566,2.3429

Jean le Rond d'Alembert,"d'Alembert, Jean le Rond",,1717-1783," ",Encyclop√©die M√©thodique - Mathematiques.,"The Mathematical Sciences part of d'Alembert's <i>Encyclop√©die M√©thodique<i>, including Optics.","The <i>Encyclop√©die, ou dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des arts et des m√©tiers<i>, edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert had been finished in 1772, though supplements, revised editions, and translations appeared after that. In 1775, Charles Joseph Panckoucke obtained the rights to reissue the work, and he published supplements and an index. But Panckoucke's plane was of larger scope. In the <i>Encyclop√©die<i>, the articles on individual topics were arranged alphabetically; Panckoucke wanted the material arranged by broad subject. His new schema has 26 divisions, among them: Mathematics, Physics, Medicine, Botany, Theology, Philosophy, Law, and Commerce. Each would have its own multivolume dictionary, including expanded versions of appropriate articles from the original <i>Encyclop√©die<i>, updated as necessary, and articles of new developments. The result was the <i> Encyclop√©die m√©thodique par ordre des mati√®res<i>, 'Methodical Encyclopedia by Order of Subject Matter.' The first volume (of Law) appeared in 1782.||The volumes in the division on mathematics were edited by  the Abb√© Bossut, a disciple of d'Alembert. Though D'Alembert had prepared more than half of the articles on pure mathematics for the original <i>Encyclop√©die<i>, his death in 1783 prevented him participating in the new work. The three volumes of the mathematics dictionary appeared in 1782, 1785, and 1789. In the front matter of the last volume, Panckoucke declares the division of mathematics ended. Another volume in the division has been promised, Games and Recreational Mathematics, but Panckoucke states it would be added later. It was completed in 1792 as a follow-up to Volume III of Mathematics. It is bound in at the end of Volume III in this copy. The mathematical division included astronomy, geometry, mechanics, hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, optics, perspective and gnomonics; subjects long associated with mathematics. Bossut's long preliminary discourse (114 pages) gives a history of mathematics.||The project of producing all the volumes for all of the divisions would take 50 years to complete, comprising 166 volumes containing 119,000 pages from 2250 contributors.","Generally, Bossut's reproduced the original articles on mathematics from the  original <i>Encyclop√©die<i> and its Supplement. The many new entries, corrections, and additions were usually the work of Bossut. Lalande was the sole author of the entries on astronomy. Condorcet, who had been entrusted by Panckoucke with the articles on mathematical analysis in the Supplement and had written many new studies for it, corrected many of these in the <i>Encyclopedie Methodique<i> and prepared several new ones.||In optics, there are entries on: optics, catoptrics, dioptrics, reflection, refraction, diffraction, double refraction, mirrors, lenses and their manufacture including achromatic lenses, telescopes, microscopes, light, atmospheric refraction, and the rainbow and other meteorological optical phenomena.","The Encyclopedie Methodique|Watts, G.B.|<i>PMLA<i>, Vol 73, No 4, 1958, pp 348-366.",Encyclop√©die m√©thodique par ordre des mati√®res.

Rudjer Josip Bo≈°koviƒá,"Bo≈°koviƒá, Rudjer Josip","Boscovich, Ruggero",1711-1787," ","Opera pertinentia ad opticam, et astronomiam","A collection of 45 separate works, large and small, dealing with optics and its application to astronomy. Most of these describe work conducted during Bo≈°koviƒá's 10-year stay in Paris, though some date back to his earliest work in 1763.","After the dissolution of the Jesuits in 1773, Rudjer Josip Bo≈°koviƒá settled in Paris where he stayed for 10 years. During this time he resumed optical work he had begun while in Rome at the Collegium Romanum and conducted new and extensive work in optics, both theoretical and practical. Bo≈°koviƒá hand long been aware both of how important the presses of scientific societies and governments were in disseminating knowledge, and of the contrast between the prevalence and opportunity of such publishing in Italy compared to France, England, or Germany. After 10 years of optical work in France and with only occasional and widely-scattered publication, he was keen that all the work be published. But nothing came of an effort to get his optics works published by the royal press at the expense of the king of France. His works were highly mathematical, primarily in Latin, and narrow in scope so  there was no interest from commercial publishers in France. All of this appeared to play a role in his return to Italy in 1783; an extended search and negotiations had finally resulted in an agreement with Giuseppe Remondini of Venice. Bo≈°koviƒá moved to Bassano del Grappa to perform the two years of editorial work and oversight of the printing of all five volumes. Though printed in Venice, Bo≈°koviƒá was mindful of and grateful for his long stay in Paris; the work is dedicated to Louis XVI. This summary of Bo≈°koviƒá's highly technical optical work was a standard reference for opticians; Lorenzo Selva, for example, mentions the '5 Volumes of Bo≈°koviƒá' in the preface to his <i>Sei Dialoghi Ottici<i> of 1787.
","The <i>Opera Omnia Optica<i> of  Bo≈°koviƒá contains 45 separate works, large and small, most of them describing work conducted during his 10-year stay in Paris, though some date back to his earliest work in 1763. Volume 1: Construction and use of an instrument for measuring refractive index; Formulas for calculating lens foci, with applications. Volume 2: Nine smaller works on lenses, micrometers, the velocity of light, and atmospheric refraction. Volume 3: Determining comet orbits from observations; On a new planet. Volume 4: Thirteen smaller works on the construction and use of astronomical instruments including secants, quadrants, mural telescopes, and micrometers. Volume 5: Fourteen smaller works on astronomical observations, and the mathematics of data reduction. The most important and influential optical work of Bo≈°koviƒá was his demonstration of the need to accurately measure the refractive indices of glasses and the development of instruments to do that; part of his work in achromatic telescope lenses. Volume 2 contains his treatise on the design and construction of achromatic lenses.  It is guided by Boscovich's considerable practical experience with optics and optical instruments, is a considerable practical improvement over the work of Clairaut, D'Alambert, and Euler 30 years earlier. No more complete, practical treatise on achromatic lenses would appear until George Airy incorporated Joseph Fraunhofer's work thirty-five years later.","L‚ÄôOpera Omnia di Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich e problemi connessi: lunga storia di un progetto|Proverbio, E.|<i>Atti della 'Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi'<i>, Vol 66, No 1, 2011, pp 117-152.||R.

William Enfield,"Enfield, William",,1741-1797," ",Institutes of natural philosophy,"William Enfield's text book for use in classes he taught in natural philosophy, including the mathematics thought necessary to provide more than a superficial understanding of the subjects.
","The Warrington Academy was, from 1756 to 1782, was a prominent private teaching academy set up by and for those who dissented from the established Church of England. Natural philosophy was taught by John Holt, then by George Walker, and eventually by William Enfield in 1774. Enfield began assembling a course and 10 years later its notes and content formed the basis of his text book. He wrote this text book for use in classes he taught and his preface explains his reason and the need: he found other texts either 'materially deficient in mathematical demonstration'  or too 'copious and abstruse for elementary instruction.' Self-taught in mathematics, Enfield believed it and its application were essential to understanding natural philosophy if anything other than a thin superficiality was to be achieved. He stated he had no desire to be original (he had no formal training in natural philosophy), rather to effect a clear and useful presentation. To that end he used works of Newton, Keil, Whiston, Gravesande, Cotes, Smith, Helsham, Rowning, and Rutherford as it suited his plan for the text. He omits Chemistry from his scope, considering not part of 'mechanical philosophy.' The work is dedicated to Joseph Priestley, another dissenting cleric active in natural philosophy. Editions appeared in 1785, 1799, and edited American editions in 1802, 1811, and 1824.
","William Enfield's text is in seven books:  Matter; Mechanics; Hydrostatics and Pneumatics; Optics and Vision; Astronomy; Magnetism; Electricity. The optics material in Book IV (95 pages) includes: The nature of light, refraction and images from lenses, reflection and reflected images, vision and eye-function, color and prismatic refraction, the rainbows, optical instruments including the telescope, microscope, magic lantern, and camera obscura. The physical optics is purely Newtonian, and the geometrical optics is a precis from Smith's Complete System of Opticks.  Generally, the material is elementary but detailed, geometric, and accompanied by extended demonstrations and discussions. The style is classical: presentation of axioms and definitions, proposition and proofs, examples and discussion.","Science for Polite Society: British Dissent and the Teaching of Natural Philosophy in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries|Reid, D.A.|In: History of Universities: Volume XXI/2, Feingold, M., editor, 2006, 352 pp, NB: pp 117-158.","Institutes of natural philosophy, theoretical and experimental.

In 1775, Charles Joseph Panckoucke obtained the rights to reissue the work, and he published supplements and an index. But Panckoucke's plane was of larger scope. In the <i>Encyclop√©die<i>, the articles on individual topics were arranged alphabetically; Panckoucke wanted the material arranged by broad subject. His new schema has 26 divisions, among them: Mathematics, Physics, Medicine, Botany, Theology, Philosophy, Law, and Commerce. Each would have its own multivolume dictionary, including expanded versions of appropriate articles from the original <i>Encyclop√©die<i>, updated as necessary, and articles of new developments. The result was the <i> Encyclop√©die m√©thodique par ordre des mati√®res<i>, 'Methodical Encyclopedia by Order of Subject Matter.' The first volume (of Law) appeared in 1782.||The volumes in the division on mathematics were edited by  the Abb√© Bossut, a disciple of d'Alembert.

Isaac Newton,"Newton, Isaac",,1642-1727,"Translated by Jean Paul Marat (1743-1793) French physician, natural philosopher, political activist.",Optique de Newton,"Jean Paul Marat's French translation of the fourth edition of Newton's <i>Opticks<i> of 1730.
","Jean Paul Marat's French translation of the fourth edition of Newton's <i>Opticks<i> of 1730. Marat's translation is generally judged to be superior to either edition of Coste's translation. Marat presents a more readable style while almost always conveying the correct meaning of the English text. Though Marat had developed his own theory of color which was in opposition to Newton's, the translation remains faithful to Newton. Marat does present his ideas regarding a theory of light and color at the end of the translation in the form of 30 questions with extended answers and discussion, and some additional observations. A facsimile edition appeared at Paris in 1989, reprinted in 2015.
","Fourth edition of the <i>Opticks<i> of 1704. A reprinting of the 1721 edition with only a few minor changes made by Newton. This editions includes citations from the Lectiones Opticae which had just been published. The citations point to demonstrations and experiments in the Lectiones Opticae that were omitted by Newton when the Opticks of 1704 was composed. Like the first English edition of the Opticks, the fourth edition is in three Books. Book I is in two parts. Part I deals with prism experiments and the spectral heterogeneity of white light. It begins with definitions and axioms that review the basic aspects of geometric optics of reflection and refraction. This is followed by 8 propositions based on 16 experiments dealing with chromatic inhomogeneity and its consequences. Propositions 7 and 8 deal specifically with the limitations imposed on telescope objectives by what is now called chromatic aberration. Part II presents 11 propositions based on 17 experiments investigating the nature of color and the application of the theory of chromatic heterogeneity, particularly to the rainbow. It is here that Newton's 'experimentum crucis' of his letter of 1672 is presented in refined form and great detail.||Book II is in four parts. Part I presents 24 observations of the colored fringes produced by light passing through glass plates and thin lenses in contact in air and water. Part II presents a mathematical analysis of these observations, including Newton's method for determining small separating distances. Part III presents 20 propositions dealing with colors of natural bodies and their relationship to prismatic colors and color production in thin plates. it is here that Newton proposes that light has 'Fits of easy reflection and fits of easy transmission.' Part IV presents 13 observations of colors produced by thick plates.||Book III presents 11 descriptive observations of the color and placement of diffraction fringes produced by various objects. Queries--rhetorical questions--were Newton's means of proposing ideas about natural philosophy in general and the nature of light and color in particular. It is here that Newton dismisses wave theories of light as incapable of explaining its observed properties. The second English edition of the <i>Opticks<i> contains the original 16 Queries of the <i>Opticks<i>, the 7 added in the <i>Optice<i> of 1706, and 8 new ones. The 8 Queries new in the second English edition are placed after the original 16 and are number 17-24. The 7 Queries new in the <i>Optice<i> of 1706 are here numbers 25-31, and adds extensively to Queries 10 and 11. The <i>Optice<i> also provides an addendum describing luminescent light sources. Queries  25-31 were new in the <i>Optice<i> and deal with double refraction and, perhaps most importantly, the nature of space, the plenum, the aether, and luminous corpuscles. Query 31, new in the Optice, is the longest of all, by far, and deals with gravitational attraction and ends with Newton's remarkable paragraph linking the development of natural and moral philosophy. Queries 17-24, were new in the second English edition, and deal with the Newton's idea of the aether or subtle, particular matter and its interaction with heat and light. Also new in the second English edition was reference to the ""mercurial light"" of Hauksbee's experiments.","<i>Isaac Newton, Optique, Traduit de l‚Äôanglais par Jean-Paul Marat (1787)<i>|Blay, M.|Dunod, Paris, 2015, p 375, NB pp 50-69.","Optique de Newton, traduction nouvelle, faite par M***  sur la dernieÃÄre eÃÅdition originale, orneÃÅe de vingt-une planches, & approuveÃÅe par l'AcadeÃÅmie royale des Sciences; deÃÅdieÃÅe au Roi, par M.

Though he began it in 1771, he eventually decided to cast the entire work into 'a more pleasant form,' and wrote a set of dialogues, rather than just discourses. Though a draft was ready in 1785, he had heard that the Opera Omnia Optica of his friend Rudjer Bo≈°koviƒá was about to be published in near-by Bassano and delayed his own work two years so as to include the latest updates in theory and practice. The dialogues take place between a professor, a count, and a cleric. though similar to the catalogue of 1761--instruments, technical information, optical theory, and applications in astronomy, microscopy, and other sciences are presented--the scope is considerably enlarged, and two additional plates of figures were used.
","A series of six dialogues in which three interlocutors discuss and describe the optical instruments made and sold by Lorenzo Selva and  two of his sons. The first dialogue involves the eye, its optics and function, the nature of lenses, the correction of myopic, hyperopic, and presbyopic vision by spectacles, and the magnification of images by lenses in general. The second dialogue involves spyglasses and telescopes, including: lensed telescopes, and optical levels. The third dialogue involves catadioptric telescopes, catoptric telescopes, Gregorian telescopes and micrometers. The fourth dialogue centers on glass properties, measuring refractive index, and Boscovich's vitrometer, flint glass, and achromatic lenses. The fifth dialogue involves microscopes, including: simple microscopes, compound microscopes, solar microscopes, catadioptric microscopes, catoptric microscopes, the 'universal' microscope. The sixth dialogue involves various lenses, burning mirrors, cameras obscura, and magic lanterns. The instruments are described in considerable detail, but without any elaborate theory or mathematics.

The textbook initiated the mathematical physics movement in the piarist schools in northern Italy at the end of the 18th century; moving beyond the Scholastic and Cartesian traditions and embracing experimental and analytic physics. The emphasis is on analytical demonstrations, rather than derivations, and many worked examples showed how mathematics was used to solve problems.

Based on the 2nd, expanded London edition of 1787. As stated in the preface, Nicholson wrote for an audience interested in 'pursuit of the highest utility and entertainment' and his book was 'intended to give a clear account of the present state of Natural Philosophy; in such as possess very little mathematical knowledge.' As with many popularizers of science, Nicholson wanted to avoid 'prolix disquisitions . . . less than intelligible' on the one hand and 'the affectation of familiarity . . . with lax and unsophisticated explanations' on the other. The American editions were widely used and influential, as evidenced by, for example, the many references to Nicholson's book in letters to and from Thomas Jefferson; the references being made in a manner that assumed everyone would know the work. Editions appeared at London in 1782, 1787, 1790, 1796, 1805, and at Philadelphia in 1788, 1793, 1795. An Italian translation appeared at Florence in 1800.

","Third edition of the Italian translation of Paulian's <i>Dictionnaire de Physique<i> of 1761. Paulian produced his earlier <i>Dictionnaire de Physique Portatif<i> in 1758; a first attempt at propagating the ideas of Newton. Three years later it was expanded into the <i>Dictionnnaire de Physique<i>; a textbook masquerading as a subject dictionary meant for the autodidact and the student. Paulian drew from many sources and the Preface of first edition of the <i>Dictionnnaire<i> gives 3 and one-half, two-column pages of works and authors. Paulian's natural philosophy was not purely Newtonian, and unlike Desaguliers who presented Newtonian ideas without ornament or interference, Paulian was in an ongoing process of developing his own amalgam of Cartesian and Newtonian natural philosophy, and the <i>Dictionnnaire<i> reflects this free blending and extrapolation. The material in the <i>Dictionnnaire<i> is wide-ranging, with 'Physics' given a very wide compass--the first entry is 'Abdomen.' As new developments appeared Paulian augmented and revised the <i>Dictionnnaire<i>, and so each edition was significantly expanded. Starting as three volumes, it grew to four and eventually to five. An example is an article on achromatic telescopes added to the second edition of 1773. Editions appeared in 1761, 1773, 1781, and 1789. An Italian translation appeared at Venice in 1770, 1779, 1790 (the present edition), and 1794.
","The optics entries in the <i>Dictionnaire<i> are among its most extensive and include the following Catoptrique: laws of reflection, reflected images, convex and concave mirrors. Colors: Newton's prismatic colors, object colors, Newton's explanation of color, Descartes's unsustainable system, the rainbow. Diffraction: definition, cause. Dioptrique: convex and concave lenses, convergent and divergent rays, burning lenses, analogies with mirrors, lens foci. Lumiere: nature and propagation of light; light as corpuscles traveling nearly infinitely fast; various atmospheric luminous phenomena. Microscope: simple and compound microscope, solar microscope, brief history. Ombre: shadows cast by large sources, shadows of the earth and moon, astronomical distances determined from shadows. Optique: direct light, visual perception, persistence, binocular vision, vision and spectacles. Reflexion: cause of reflection, elasticity. Refraction: atmospheric refraction, refraction in solids, law of refraction, cause of refraction. Telescope: dioptric and catoptric telescopes, the Newtonian and Gregorian telescope. Most of these entries are concise explications containing propositions and demonstrations accompanied by figures.

The experiments he conducted and his interpretation of their results, convinced him that Newton's theory of prismatic colors was incorrect. Rather than light being decomposed into colors by refraction, Goethe was convinced that color was the result of the interaction light and dark. This gave new polish to the Scholastic theory of the mixing of light and dark, white and black. The reaction of the scientific community was generally negative. Goethe later wrote 'As soon as my <i>Beitr√§ge zur Optik<i> had appeared, the whole fraternity felt obliged to fall upon me and to show that what I still regarded as problematic had long since been explained.' He would publish nothing further regarding optics for nearly 20 years; not until his <i>Zur Farbenlehre<i> of 1810.||When Goethe became interested is color, he knew his university education had not included discussion of prismatic colors or the camera obscura, so he read Johann Erxleben's <i>AnfangsgruÃànde der Naturlehre<i> (likely the 1787 edition) material on optics.||A large gray-scale and color path table and 27 color experiment demonstration cards were meant to accompany the text. These were not issued or sold with the text and had to be purchased separately. The book trade at the time did not bundle text and cards together. Consequently, the cards almost never found with the text. A facsimile set of cards and table was published in 1928.||This copy bound with Goethe's <i>Beytrage zur Optik Zweites Stuck<i> dated 1792.
","The sections of <i>Goethe's Beytrage zur Optik<i> are titled: Introduction, Prismatic displays in general, Special prismatic experiments, Review and further work, Recapitulation, On the apparatus necessary for these experiments, and especially on cards issued with this work. Unlike Newton's experiments which evaluated the display of prismatically refracted light on a screen, all of Goethe's experiments involved looking through a prism at surfaces and objects. In the recapitulation section, Goethe states that viewing surfaces and object through a prism shows that color appears only at white/black, bright/dark boundaries and reaches the conclusion that (essentially) color is the interaction of light and dark, white and black, and is not a heterogeneous property of light. <i>Beytrage zur Optik<i> contains the first applications of Goethe's idea of 'Der Versuch als Vermittler von Objekt und Subjekt'--<i>experiment as mediator between subject and object<i>--not, as Newtonian science had it, the disinterested revealer of nature.","<i>Goethe contra Newton: Polemics and the Project for a New Science of Color<i>|Sepper, D.|Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press, 1988, pp 46-57.||ùëª <i>Goethe‚Äôs Theory of Colour<i>|Schindler, M.|Sussex, UK: Steiner Press, 1970, pp 121‚Äì161.||The Nature of Light and Color: Goethe‚Äôs 'Der Versuch als Vermittler' versus Newton‚Äôs Experimentum Crucis|Marcum, J.A.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>,Vol 17, No 4, 2009, pp 457-481.||Goethe‚Äôs theory of colors between the ancient philosophy, middle ages occultism and modern science|Barsan, V., Merticarlu, A.|<i>Cogent Arts & Humanities<i>, Vol 3, No 1, 2016.",J.W. von Goethe Beytrage zur Optik.

Between 1758 and 1769 Abraham K√§stner published four parts to his <i>Anfangsgr√ºnde<i> series: I Mathematics, II Applied Mathematics, III Analysis of the finite and infinite, IV Mechanics and Hydrodynamics. The <i>Anfangsgr√ºnde der angewandten Mathematik<i> is Part Two, consisting itself of two parts: aspects of mechanics and optics, and astronomy, geography, chronology and gnomics. K√§stner's text not only filled the need for a technical book in the vernacular in German universities, but also furthered his program to demonstrate the importance and utility of applied mathematics. The initial preliminary material meant that beginning students could start their study with mathematics, while advanced students could begin with its applications. Editions of the the <i>Anfangsgr√ºnde der angewandten Mathematik<i> appeared in 1759, 1765, 1780/1781, and 1792. Each edition has a new preface and contains revisions by K√§stner, clarifying proofs, updating or adding material. The widespread and continuing use of these texts was due, in part, to K√§stner's interest in making sure they were up to date. Thus, each edition gives an accurate idea of what was thought to be important to teach regarding natural philosophy.
","A  textbook for mixed or applied mathematics with chapters entitled: Statics, Hydrostatics, Aerometry, Hydraulics, Optics, Catoptrics, Dioptrics, Astronomy, Geography, Chronology, Gnomics, Artillery, Fortification, Construction. The three chapters on optics (87 pages) contain the following.  I Optics: nature and spread of light, parallel rays, shadows, camera obscura, images and perceptions. II Catoptrics: mirrors, law of reflection, plane mirrors, spherical mirrors, higher-order mirrors. III Dioptrics: refraction, refraction at air and glass, finding the refracted beam from the incident, total internal reflection, types of lenses, foci, image of a point, image of an object, color, the eye, eye-function and spectacles, the telescope, the microscope, diffraction of light. The material is descriptive, elementary and entirely geometrical-optical; physical optics and the nature of light are mentioned only very briefly, but the material on color is Newtonian.","‚ÅÇ <i>Teaching the Mathematical Sciences at French and German Universities during the 18th Century<i>|Confalonieri, S. and Kr√∂ger, D.|Cuvillier Verlag, 2016, pp 29-40.||Abraham Gotthelf K√§stner and his

","The work is in four sections: Fundamental notes on Intelligence for the entire work; Optics of nature and of Education; Resolution of Molineux's problem using the Previous Principles; How inconsistent and absurd the positive answers to the Question are. Sarti introduces the idea of a maximum sensual force; its extent and power depends on how many and to what extent the senses are operating simultaneously and interactively. Such as smell and taste, hearing and head movement, or vision and hand motion. Sarti believed that sight and touch form different 'primary ideas' and no pure abstractions arose. For Sarti, touch was the dominant sense and informed vision. So, if the blind could suddenly see, but not touch, a globe and cube, they could not correctly name them.","<i>Animation, Plasticity, and Music in Italy, 1770-1830<i>|Lockhart, E.|University of California Press, 2017, pp 120-125.||Molyneux's Problem|Marjolein, D., Lokhorst, G.-J.|In: <i>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy<i> (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N.

","John Adams' <i>An essay on vision<i> first appeared in 1789. In his Preface he makes clear that the purpose of the work is to discourage both the premature use of eye glasses while vision is strong and the postponement of their use after vision has grown weak. The translator, Friedrich Christian Kries, was a teacher in Gotha with a keen sense for the importance of natural philosophy and its applications. He was committed to education in Germany and translated technical works from English, French, and Italian into German. He edited the writings of Georg Christoph Lichtenberg , Germany's first great professor of experimental physics.
","Adams begins with a list of work he cites, including those by De la Caille, Harris, Le Cat, Porterfield, Priestley, Smith, Thomin, and Trabaud. The body of the work is in two sections. The first and shorter of the two is a description of ocular anatomy and the function of parts of the eye. The second considers the nature of light and vision. This includes aspects of image formation and the basic properties of  perception: size, position, motion, and color. How vision affected by the atmosphere and distance is also described. Accommodation and adaptation are described. Finally, imperfect sight and its correction by spectacles is described. The work ends with Adams' recommendations regarding the types of spectacles to purchase and how to use them; reading spectacles, spectacles with colored glass, spectacle use after cataract operations, spectacles for the near and far-sighted.","German Physics Textbooks in the <i>Goethezeit<i>, Part 1 and Part 2|Clark, W.|<i>History of Science<i>, Vo.l 35, No 2, 3 1997, pp 219-239, 297-363.","George Adams's Anweisung zur Erhaltung des Gesichts und ihr Kenntniss der Natur des Sehens.

He had produced extended essays on each of these topics, focusing on the instruments involved. Near the end of his life, he produced this 5-volume work that covered all these areas. The work is tinctured with Adams's  Tory politics, religious convictions, and antipathy to mathematics. Adams was primarily an instrument maker and so relied heavily on other sources to assemble his material. In his Preface, Adams lists the 41 different authors and works he consulted, ranging in date from 1774 to 1792. The 52 lectures are simply descriptive and conversational--Adams speaks in the first person to the reader. No theory is given, just facts and principles, supported by figures and descriptions of how instruments can be used to demonstrate phenomena.

BuÃàsch makes clear in his forward that the Encyclopedia was an expansion of the mathematical part of the previous work, augmented considerably and meant to update and replace Wolff's famous textbook. BuÃàsch notes that editions of the Wolff texts were only very slightly updated and stopped altogether in 1740. BuÃàsch relied on his own collection of books, which he considered to be very complete, and cites them extensively in the Encyclopedia.

At the time of this publication, its 4-foot diameter mirror was the largest ever made for a telescope.","William Herschel wrote this description of his huge telescope to acknowledge the financial support of King George III for its construction, to describe its details to interested telescope mechanics, and to declare to the community of astronomers what could be expected to be discovered, verified, disproved, and clarified in observational astronomy. The expectations proved impossible to satisfy with the instrument; sitting as it did outdoors, its mirror was subject to all the depredations of weather; the number of good viewing nights were limited; the time required to setup the instrument for viewing was so great that it was spent, rather, using Herschel's smaller telescopes; the mirror required refinishing at least every two years, if not more often. The use and reputation of the huge instrument would eventually recede to zero. But all this was in the future; at the time of publication Herschel's telescope was considered one of the wonders of the astronomical world, it 4-foot diameter mirror being the largest ever made for a telescope.
","The article begins with a general history of instrument's development; the most important being the history of its mirrors. The first, weighing 1/2 ton, was able to take an excellent polish but proved to be too thin and the sag caused by gravity when tilted, changed it's figure enough to make it unusable. The second, weighing a full ton, was thick enough to hold its figure but its size and weight made it exceedingly difficult to polish. The first part also contains a description of its use in the discovery of new moons of Saturn. The rest of the article describes in great detail the mechanical aspects of the instrument as well as the method of its use in observations. In addition to the famous plate showing the full instrument, detailed figures accompany the mechanical description."," Herschel's 40ft Reflector: Funding and Functions|Hoskin, M.|<i>Journal for the History of Astronomy<i>, Vol 34, Part 1, No 114, 2003, pp 1 - 32.||<i>The History of the Telescope<i>|King, H.C|Dover, New York, 1979, 456 pp, NB: pp 120-142.","""Description of a Forty-feet Reflecting Telescope"" By William Herschel, LL.D.

Abraham Gotthelf K√§stner,"K√§stner, Abraham Gotthelf",,1719-1800," ",Geschichte der Mathematik,"One of K√§stner's two famous works: a history of pure, applied and mixed mathematics. His history spans a remarkable range of topics, including mechanics, optics, and astronomy and was a standard work in history for many years.","Abraham Gotthelf K√§stner produced two famous works, both in four volumes; a general textbook in mathematics and natural philosophy, the <i>Mathematische Anfangsgr√ºnde<i> of 1758-1769; and a history of pure, applied and mixed mathematics, the <i>Geschichte der Mathematik<i> of 1796-1800. The history was to be part of a larger G√∂ttingen project to produce a history of the sciences. In his long introduction of volume 1, K√§stner maintains there is a strong connections between the history of mathematics and of philosophy, referring historians of mathematics to textbooks in the history of philosophy. K√§stner defines the subject of his history this way: 'History of a science
is, according to me, how science‚Äôs doctrines have been discovered, made known, determined, corrected, presented, explicated, and applied. All this can only be learned little by little through continuous dedication to this science.' For K√§stner, 'Mathematics' was very broad, and his history spans a remarkable range of topics, including mechanics, optics, and astronomy. It was standard work in history for many years; volume 2, published in 1787, is still considered one of the standard sources on the early history of mathematical optics.
","Abraham Gotthelf K√§stner's history of mathematics is in three parts: from the restoration of the learning to about 1600, from 1600 to Descartes, from Descartes to the end of the 18th century. Volume 1: arithmetic, elementary geometry, algebra, and practical geometry. Volume 2: perspective, geometric analysis and higher geometry, mechanics, optics, astronomy. Volume 3: pure mathematics, analysis, geometric analysis, practical geometry, geometric instruments. Volume 4: mechanics, optics, and astronomy. The history of optics in volumes 2 and 4 is, consistent with the intention of the work, that of analytical optics and its development. This is not a descriptive history; rather it is framework built from citations of important books and a very brief analysis of their content. It is remarkable for the range and completeness of the works in geometrical optics that are cited.","Science and the History of the Sciences.

Count Carlo Barattieri,"Barattieri, Count Carlo",,1738-1806," ",Scoperte sul Gran Fenomeno della Colorazione,"A short treatise on the cause of color and, importantly, proposing a theory as to the cause of color perception.","Carlo Barattieri reports in this short treatise his answer to the question of the cause of color. Importantly, Barattieri proposed a theory as to the cause of color perception. That is, what is it about the components of heterogeneous light that, when dispersed by a prism, cause the appearance of color. A shorted, second part appeared in 1797.
","Barattieri proposes a theory of light a color that is a step beyond Newton. Barattieri holds that 'A ray of light is an aggregate of tenuous homogeneous particles of highly elastic matter, vibrated by self-luminous bodies.' These particles are capable of exciting the sensation of vision. Further, he holds that color perception has a 'variety, and intensity, for my belief, depends on the speed, rotation, combination, quantity, and strength with which the aforementioned particles invest the indicated organ.' Barattieri hold that heterogeneous light is dispersed by a prism but that does not explain the phenomenon of the perceived colors. Importantly, he is presenting a theory of color perception. The bulk of the treatise describe a series of experiments with results that he interprets as supporting his ideas. The treatise ends with a table that organizes colors by Barattieri's theory. The prismatic colors of red, yellow, green, azure, violet, are 'radical' or 'clear', and are 'softened' in their combination to produce all colors.","Books on Color 1495-2015|Osborne, R.|Thylesius Books, 2015, unpaginated.",Scoperte sul Gran Fenomeno della Colorazione Carlo Barattieri.,Discoveries Regarding the Grand Phenomenon of Coloring,,1797,1775-1800,"Italian natural philospher, from an ancient noble family in Piacenza, wrote on optics and color",1,1797,,,Piacenza,Giuseppe Tedeschi,,,,[A]-E‚Å¥ œá¬π,[1-2] 3-41 [ùüô],Plates [I-II] folding,,Contemporary Gilt Stamped Paste Boards,8 in 4s,200,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1797 Barattieri - Scoperte sul Gran Fenomeno della Colorazione - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,http://books.google.com/books?id=i4R51asfskAC&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false,572,Minerva Auctions,44.8678,9.6206

He rejects the Newtonian (and Boscovich's) proposal of attractive forces acting at a distance, and offers instead a mechanical theory. 
","Fusinieri proposes that any acceptable explanation of refraction must be able to predict Snell's Law of Refraction. He devises an analysis of the attraction hypothesis that produces direct contradictions with Snell's Law and visual experience, and on this basis searches for a different cause of refraction. The material is in seven articles. 1: The motion of small bodies toward the surface of larger bodies. 2: General theory of refraction based on attraction. 3: Application this theory to refraction in lenses.  4: Consequences for refraction of lenses in air and water. 5: The falsity of the theory of refraction by attraction when applied to the refraction of the moon. 6: Propagation of small bodies in material of diverse resistance. 7: On the nature of light.

","A complete and update and revision-by-way-of-addenda of the 1755 edition of Christian Wolff's <i>Der Anfangs-GruÃànde Aller Mathematischen Wissenschaften<i> performed by Johann Tobias Mayer and Karl Christian von Langsdorf. The new preface mentions that the mathematical part of Wolff's text needed little change, only some additions. The applied mathematical part required extended addenda. The added material is marked with a letter indicating which editor was responsible. The concision and culling was sufficient so that the textbook fit in a 900-page volume. As the preface states, the book arose from a need at Erlangen where both editors taught. Though there was only one edition of this textbook, it was the basis for Mayer's text <i>Anfangsgr√ºnde der Naturlehre zum Behuf der Vorlesungen √ºber die Experimental-Physik<i>, editions of which appeared in 1801, 1812, and 1827 and was widely used in German speaking countries.
","The topics covered in the textbook and the editorial work was apportioned as follows: Mayer: Arithmetic, algebra, higher geometry, analysis, optics, catoptrics, dioptrics, perspective, astronomy, geography, chronology, gnomics, artillery, fortification; Langsdorf: Geometry, trigonometry, mechanics, hydrostatics, aeronometry, hydraulics, architecture. Wolff's original textbook was Scholastic in form and style, Mayer and Langsdorf's new edition is more modern, with theorems, proofs, notes, and experiments, followed by long descriptive observation sections and worked examples. The material in Mayer's optical sections (69 pages) is elementary with no mathematics above geometry involved. Notes are used extensively to cite works where the student reader can find more detail.","<i>Teaching the Mathematical Sciences at French and German Universities during the 18th Century<i>|Confalonieri, S. and Kr√∂ger, D.|Cuvillier Verlag, 2016, pp 29-93.||Christian Wolff (1679-1754) and his contribution for the Mathematics Education|Nobre, S|In: <i>Proceedings of the XXth International Congress of History of Science<i>|Brepols, 2002, pp 89-94.||German Physics Textbooks in the <i>Goethezeit<i>, Part 1 and Part 2|Clark, W.|<i>History of Science<i>, Vo.l 35, No 2, 3 1997, pp 219-239, 297-263.",Neuer Auszug aus den Anfangsgr√ºnden aller Mathematischen Wissenschaften.

Not only does Montucla provide a comprehensive history of the development of mathematical ideas, but he also includes mechanics, physics, probability, astronomy, music, mathematical geography, and navigation. The first edition, published in 1758, covered mathematical history to the end of the 17th century. Montucla had intended to add a third volume covering mathematics to the mid-18th century but the did not continue. In the 1790s Montucla began working on the second edition, revising and expanding the first two volumes and adding a third devoted to 18th-century mathematics. But he died but died before the project was finished. The astronomer J√©r√¥ome De La Lande, his friend from childhood, assisted by others, completed the final two volumes.

Friedrich Wilhelm August Murhard,"Murhard, Friedrich Wilhelm August",,1779-1853," ",Bibliotheca Mathematica,A comprehensive bibliography of the older literature in mathematics and related areas of mechanics and optics.,"Murhard's bibliography is in five volumes, the first two appeared in 1797 and 1798, the last three in 1803, 1804, and 1805. This long-term project of Murhard's included the older works in mathematics and many related subjects, including bookkeeping, optics, physics, astronomy, navigation, hydraulics, mechanics, architecture, and fortifications. Approximately 10,000 titles are listed chronologically by subject. The first two volumes are dedicated to Abraham Gotthelf K√§stner, Hofrath Heyne. Each entry has a date, an author, and a brief description of the work.||The work apparently grew in scope and prompted the last three volumes: they are subtitled <i>Litteratur der mechanischen und optischen Wissenschaften<i>. Volumes 3 and 4 are devoted to mechanics. All of Volume 5 is devoted to the literature of optics. Murhard's bibliography is the first index of wide scope and temporal reach in mathematical and related works. Though now known to be somewhat inaccurate, the mathematician De Morgan mentions his indebtedness to Murhard's bibliography. It stands along side J.E. Scheibel‚Äôs <i>Einleitung zur Mathematischen B√ºcherkenntnis<i> of 1769-98 as the two principal mathematical bibliographic works of the 18th century.","Volume 5 is devoted to optics and has the following sections. I: introductory texts to the optical sciences, II: General works. III: Writings on individual subjects in the optical sciences. IV: Auxiliary sciences in optics. Section III includes subsections on the eye, vision, eye-function, light and light rays, physical optics, color, the rainbow, telescope, microscope, micrometers, mirrors, camera obscura and magic lantern, and lamps and photometry. Some of the entries are in the first decade of the 16th century, and it is clear that Murhard had extensive access to historical literature and the works themselves.

Johann Friedrich Schultz,"Schultz, Johann Friedrich",Johann Friedrich Schulz,1739-1805," ",Kurzer Lehrbegriff der Mathematik,"An elementary course in mathematics and applied mathematics, including mechanics, optics, and astronomy.","In his Preface to the first volume, Shultz states that this text was the result of his lecture notes in pure mathematics. He discovered them to be beyond first year university students and so set out to write a extended textbook better suited for a first course for university students and for self-study. The second volume appeared seven years after the first and was the result of Schultz's teaching experience. He states in the the preface that the material on mechanics is presented with the requirement of the Calculus, believing that the essentials of statics and mechanics can be comprehended without advanced mathematics. The material on optics begins with and is anchored by material on the eye, vision, and the process of seeing. Only those aspects of Catoptrics and Dioptrics are presented which directly relate to vision. The third volume, presumably in press when Schultz died in 1805, presents elementary descriptive and observational astronomy. The optics material is indicative of the optics taught to beginning students, with its emphasis on geometric optics and physical optics before the advent of Fresnel's development of a complete wave theory of light.","The three volumes of Schultz's work cover the following  I: Arithmetic, Geometry, Trigonometry and Surveying. II: Mechanics and Optics.  III: Elementary Observational astronomy. The optics material (194 pages) in Vol 2 follows the traditional sequence of optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics. The optics section begins with and is largely focused on the eye, vision, and perception. Ocular anatomy and eye-function is covered. Light is treated in general terms, defined by the simple optical phenomena it exhibits: rectilinear propagation, reflection, refraction, diffraction, and dispersion. The greatest emphasis (by far) is on geometric optics and defines the material in the sections on catoptrics and dioptrics. Image formation and position in plane and curved mirrors is described with elementary mathematics. Refraction and lens function are similarly described, with reference made along the way to Newton's prism experiments and the nature of dispersion. Simple mathematical expressions for the location of foci for spherical convex and concave lenses are given. The telescope, microscope, and other optical instruments are described in an operational manner, using the material presented for lenses and giving some practical information for their construction. The rainbow is also described. Schultz references most of the standard works in optics, ranging from Risner's edition of Alhacen, Kepler, Newton's Optice, Traber, Zahn, Huygens, Boscovich, Euler, and Kl√ºgel.||The optics material is complete and sufficiently detailed for an elementary understanding that does not require mathematics beyond geometry, trigonometry and algebra.","Physik im Lehrbuch 1700 -1850|Lind, G.|Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1992, 403 pp, NB: pp 266-273, 297-310.","Kurzer Lehrbegriff der Mathematik I-III.

Johann Erdwin Christoph Ebermaier,"Ebermaier, Johann Erdwin Christoph",,1768-1825," ",Versuch einer Geschichte des Lichtes,"Among the earliest works on the biological influences of light, particularly on the human body.","German physician Johan Christoph Ebermayer's book has its origins as the prize-winning entry <i>Commentatio de lucis in corpus humannm vivum praeter visum efficacia<i>, submitted to the G√∂ttingen Academy in 1797. The prize essay was reworked, with additions, to produce the <i>Geschichte des Lichtes und dessen Einfluss auf den menschlichen K√∂rper<i>. Ebermayer, son of a pharmacist and originally from D√ºsseldorff, was a botanist, pharmacologist and military surgeon. While on military duty in the Ruhr, he first investigated the nature of light according to the theories of ancient through major eighteenth-century authors, and then extensively studies the effects of light on various organic and inorganic bodies, with particular attention to the plant and animal world. From this came his hypotheses regarding the positive influence of light on the physiology of the human body.","There are three parts: On the Nature of Light, Light's Effect on Nature, and Light's Effect, other than vision, on Man. Throughout the entire work, ""Light"" for Ebermaier was daylight, principally sunlight. The first part is a brief history of the opinions regarding light's nature. The second part reports light's effect on the atmosphere, on minerals, plants, and animals in general. The third part describes light's effect on humans. These include chemical, physiological, pathological, dietetic and therapeutic effects. Sunburn is considered and  Ebermaier reports different degrees of sunburn depending on the time of exposure, and that paler skin types reacted more severely than darker skin types. He also noted that sun exposure could induce an increase in skin thickness. Aside from sunburn, Ebermaier notes the general healthful, if not therapeutic, effect of daylight.

He proposes a strictly mechanical mechanism, with light particles interacting/refracting in elastic collisions with air particles. To make computations possible, he makes the simplifying assumption that the air's elasticity is proportional to its density. In the last chapter, Kramp poses and solves several practical problems in positional astronomy involving atmospheric refraction.

This is the text on optics in that series and one of the few English texts in the 18th century devoted solely to optics, the list of such texts is short: Smith in 1738, Benjamin Martin in 1740 and 1758, William Emerson in 1768, Harris posthumously in 1775, Higgins in 1776, and Woods in 1799. Wood's intention was not to produce a full compendium of optics, but rather a concise text that covered the elementary aspects of the subject and could be covered in a single university course. Editions of Wood's Optics appeared in 1799, 1801, 1811, and 1828.
","The material is covered in 13 chapters: The Nature of Light and its Propagation, Laws of Reflection, Laws of Refraction, Reflection at plane and spherical Surfaces, Images formed by Reflection, Refraction at plane and Spherical Surfaces, Images formed by Refraction, The Eye and eye-function, Optical Instruments, Chromatic Aberrations, Spherical Aberrations, The Rainbow, Caustics. Considering when it was written, the form is rather old-fashioned: a concise march of Definitions, Propositions, Corollaries, and Discussions in Scholia. The material is elementary, detailed, and based on physical principles expressed in geometry, trigonometry and ratios; with very few equations. The physical and geometric optics material relies heavily on Newton, the <i>Opticks<i> and <i>Optical Lectures<i> being cited frequently.||Importantly, Wood does not make extensive use of analysis; something which by this time the French had developed to high level in optics.

Though Harding was an observational astronomer, his interests were wide, and his translation is an early indication of the impetus Herschel's work provided for interest in and research into thermal radiation.
","William Herschel records that he was investigating the heating power of the visible prismatic spectrum produced by the sun using several thermometers, bulbs blacked with Japan ink, placed at a few positions in the visible spectrum. As a type of control, he had placed an additional thermometer beyond the red of the projected spectrum. The invisible radiation there produced the greatest temperature rise. As a check of his results, he conducted an investigation into the illuminating power of various parts of the spectrum, finding that pale green provided 'the maximum illumination' and that part beyond the read was invisible. He followed his initial discovery with a series of experiments he hoped would determine 'whether light be essentially different from radiant heat.' Herschel recorded the results from this series of experiments showing that the invisible heat radiation he had discovered beyond the red end of the prismatic solar spectrum suffer refraction, can be focused, can be reflected, and can be dispersed like visible radiation.||Herschel records his investigation into the similarities and differences between visible and invisible heat radiation. He uses both the sun and 'terrestrial' sources of heat radiation, such as a candle flame and a kitchen fire. Though he initially consider them both to be different manifestations of the same radiant phenomenon, he eventually concluded that heat and light 'have nothing in common but a certain equal degree of refrangibility.' Not withstanding this conclusion, Herschel provided in this series of papers  the enormous first impetus to the study of thermal radiation.","‚ÅÇ Herschel's Dilemma in the Interpretation of Thermal Radiation|Lovell, D.J.|<i>Isis<i>, Vol 59, No 1, 1968, pp 46-60.||<i>The Lamp of Learning: Taylor & Francis and the Development of Science Publishing<i>|Brock, W.H., Meadows A.J.|London: Taylor and Francis, 1998, pp. 89‚Äì109.||<i>A History of Scientific & Technical Periodicals: The Origins and Development of the Scientific and Technical press, 1665‚Äì1790<i>|Kronick, D.|Metuchen: Scarecrow Press, 1976.","Des Herrn Dr. Herschels Untersuchungen uÃàber die Natur der Sonnenstrahlen.

","A reprinting of the 1799 edition with very slight changes to wording. The coverage, content, and detail of the material is the same as the first edition. James Wood produced a series of textbooks for university courses in mathematics and natural philosophy between 1791-1799, <i>The Principles of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy<i>; six parts in four volumes. This is the text on optics in that series and one of the few English texts in the 18th century devoted solely to optics, the list of such texts is short: Smith in 1738, Benjamin Martin in 1740 and 1758, William Emerson in 1768, Harris posthumously in 1775, Higgins in 1776, and Woods in 1799. 
","The material is covered in 13 chapters: The Nature of Light and its Propagation, Laws of Reflection, Laws of Refraction, Reflection at plane and spherical Surfaces, Images formed by Reflection, Refraction at plane and Spherical Surfaces, Images formed by Refraction, The Eye and eye-function, Optical Instruments, Chromatic Aberrations, Spherical Aberrations, The Rainbow, Caustics. Considering when it was written, the form is rather old-fashioned: a concise march of Definitions, Propositions, Corollaries, and Discussions in Scholia. The material is elementary, detailed, and based on physical principles expressed in geometry, trigonometry and ratios; with very few equations. The physical and geometric optics material relies heavily on Newton, the Opticks and Optical Lectures being cited frequently.||Importantly, Wood does not make extensive use of analysis; something which by this time the French had developed to high level in optics. Wood's work was at the cusp of the transition that brought continental analysis to Cambridge in particular and British university education in general.","William Whewell and Cambridge Mathematics|Becher, H.W.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 1, 1980, pp. 1-48.","The Elements of Optics designed for the use of students in the University.

","Adam Walker was a self-taught, very successful, itinerant teacher and lecturer in natural philosophy. He became the most famous itinerant lecturer of the 18th century. His success depended, in part, on the popularity and utility of the several books he wrote. His manual to accompany his lectures, <i>Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy<i>, appeared in 14 editions between 1766 and 1807; his <i>Syllabus of a Course of Lectures in Natural and Experimental Philosophy<i> appeared in four editions between 1771 and 1790. The present text is based on the <i>Syllabus<i> of 1790 and describes a series of 12 lectures, and is a culmination of his teaching, writing, and travel experiences. Walker wrote 'not in an 'affected style', but rather in that of 'simplicity and clarity', which meant [that] the course is interesting and [could] be understood by all classes and social positions, and [was] particularly suited for gentlemen and ladies who [wished] to be familiar with the more rational parts and sublimes of knowledge, through the easiest and the least cost.' Editions appeared at London in 1799 and 1802, and a copied edition in 1801.
","The 12 lectures cover the following. 1: General ideas regarding Nature. 2: Properties of Matter. 3: Mechanics. 4: Chemistry. 5: The Atmosphere. 6: Hydrostatics and Hydraulics. 7: Electricity. 8: Electricity continued. 9: Optics. 10: Astronomy. 11: The Moon. 12: Astronomy continued.

William Hyde Wollaston,"Wollaston, William Hyde",,1766-1828," ","A Method of examining refractive and dispersive Powers, by prismatic Reflection.","Wollaston reports on a procedure he had been using for some years to measure refractive index.","Wollaston reports on a procedure he had been using for some years to measure refractive index, but had not seen described in the scientific literature. His ingenious device determined index of refraction by direct sighting and alignment with a protractor-type apparatus--giving the desired index directly. The measurement of refractive index had been of great practical importance for the previous half-century, being essential data required for achromatic lens design. A notable attempt at such measurements being Boscovich and his vitrometer. Wollaston's instrument was a significant improvement over all previous methods, methods which required measurement, calculation, and some uncertainty. It was the basis for similar instruments for a century. While using his instrument to investigate chromatic dispersion, Wollaston famously observed dark lines in the solar spectrum and detected what is now called ultraviolet radiation. Wollaston's was translated into French and appeared in the Annales de Chimie the following year. The paper was widely read and reviewed and even the usually-negative Edinburgh Review praised the instrument and hailed the discovery of ultraviolet rays.
","Wollaston reports the development of a total internal reflection refractometer. Using Snell's law or refraction, and the nature of total internal reflection, the instrument could determine the index of refraction of any material brought into contact with a flint-glass prism. The incident angle measurement mechanism (that angle that just produced total internal reflection) was ingenious and permitted values to be determined to within a few parts in a thousand. The paper is in three parts: The description of its construction and use and a reporting of measurements of the indices of 80 substances; Use of the same instrument to investigate chromatic dispersion; An analysis of the dispersion of totally internally reflected sunlight. It is in the last section that Wollaston notes the appearance of dark lines in the solar spectrum; they are shown in the last figure that accompanies the article. In a footnote, Wollaston remarks (prompted by Herschel's infrared studies) the he detected active radiation beyond the violet end of the solar spectrum, capable of darkening silver chloride. He acknowledges a similar and simultaneous discovery by Johann Ritter in Germany. Remarkably, Wollaston concludes that sunlight consisted of 'six species of rays,' four visible and two invisible.","‚ÅÇ <i>Pure Intelligence: The Life of William Hyde Wollaston<i>|Usselman, M.|University of Chicago Press, 2015, 412 pp, NB: pp 67-79.","""A Method of examining refractive and dispersive Powers, by prismatic Reflection.""

The paper was widely read and reviewed and, not surprisingly, with its usual abuse and sarcasm the Edinburgh Review stated it was 'disappointed to find, that so acute and ingenious an experimentalist had adopted the wild optical theory of vibrations.' Nevertheless, Wollaston's measurements and delicately-stated conclusion boosted the stock of the wave theory of light, and with this paper and the accompanying one on his refractometer, ushered in the new developments in optics that would take place in the 19th century.

Thomas Young,"Young, Thomas",,1773-1829," ",The Bakerian Lecture  On the theory of light and colours.,"The second Bakerian lecture presented by Thomas Young, proposing a wave theory of light, based on an oscillating luminiferous aether and the wave-front propagation principle described by Huygens more than century earlier. 
","Thomas Young was given the Bakerian Medal and Prize Lecture of the Royal Society of London three times: 1800, 1801, and 1803. This is the second lecture and with it Young presents a wave theory of light, based on an oscillating luminiferous aether and the wave-front propagation principle described by Huygens more than century earlier. The paper presents a theory, consisting of hypotheses and propositions. It systematically evaluates Isaac Newton's wave-theory objections and refutes them. The papers was read before the Royal Society in November of 1801 and appeared half a year later in the first part of the Transactions published in 1802. There was little if any reaction to the lecture and its printing, and no support for the theory. Predictably, the Edinburgh Review was scornful, writing that the treatment was 'paltry and unsubstantial,' and urged the Royal Society not to lower its standards by admission of Young's papers. Though Young would subsequently present evidence of the theory's correctness, the to-and-fro between the particle and wave theories of light would continue for another 20 years. A 'free translation' into German of both the second and third lectures appeared in the <i>Annalen der Physik<i> in 1811.
","Thomas Young lays out a wave theory of light in four hypotheses, nine propositions, and five corollaries. The hypotheses are as follows. 1: An all-pervading aether; 2: Luminous object excite undulations in the aether; 3: Color sensation depends on the frequency of the vibrations; 4: Aether is absorbed in various densities in various bodies and a layer of aether surrounds bodies due to their attraction. The propositions are as follows. 1: All impulses propagate with the same velocity; 2: Single luminous points produce spherical undulations; 3: Undulations through an aperture propagate rectilinearly; 4: Undulations partially reflect at interfaces of media with different densities; 5: Undulations propagate across the interface of different media in directions given by Snell's law; 6: Undulations can suffer total internal reflection; 7: Undulation velocity is affected by particle vibrations within the medium; 8: Undulation motions combine; 9: Radiant light is undulations in the aether. The corollaries rely in an essential way on the hypothesis that the aether accumulates in and surrounds bodies; using the theory they explain the following: Colors of striated surfaces, colors of thin plates, colors of thick plates, blackness, inflected colors. In this sense, the lecture is as much about the distribution of the aether as it is about waves propagating through it. Using his theory, the data Newton provided for thin-plate colors, and a presumed velocity propagation, Young calculated and reported the wavelength and frequency associated with prismatic colors. They are remarkably accurate.","Men and Milestones in Optics II: Thomas Young|Barr, E.S.|<i>Applied Optics<i>, Vol 2, No 6, 1963, pp 639-647.||Was Thomas Young a wave theorist?|Cantor, G.N.|<i>American Journal of Physics<i>, Vol 52, No 4, 1984, pp 305-308.","""The Bakerian Lecture: On the theory of light and colours.""

The prize essay was reworked, with additions, to produce the <i>Geschichte des Lichtes und dessen Einfluss auf den menschlichen K√∂rper<i>. Ebermayer, son of a pharmacist and originally from D√ºsseldorff, was a botanist, pharmacologist and military surgeon. While on military duty in the Ruhr, he first investigated the nature of light according to the theories of ancient through major eighteenth-century authors, and then extensively studies the effects of light on various organic and inorganic bodies, with particular attention to the plant and animal world. From this came his hypotheses regarding the positive influence of light on the physiology of the human body.||The translator Panzani points out that he has kept the old chemical nomenclature, now outdated, in order not to alter the original text. ","There are three parts: On the Nature of Light, Light's Effect on Nature, and Light's Effect, other than vision, on Man. Throughout the entire work, ""Light"" for Ebermaier was daylight, principally sunlight. The first part is a brief history of the opinions regarding light's nature. The second part reports light's effect on the atmosphere, on minerals, plants, and animals in general. The third part describes light's effect on humans. These include chemical, physiological, pathological, dietetic and therapeutic effects. Sunburn is considered and  Ebermaier reports different degrees of sunburn depending on the time of exposure, and that paler skin types reacted more severely than darker skin types. He also noted that sun exposure could induce an increase in skin thickness. Aside from sunburn, Ebermaier notes the general healthful, if not therapeutic, effect of daylight.","History of Therapeutic UV Radiation|Raab, W.|In: Skin cancer and UV Radiation|Altmeyer, P.

Young wrote out notes for these lectures in 21 exercise books, 20 of which exist in the library of University College London. Young wrote '... it was most eligible to commit to writing, as nearly as possible, the whole that was required to be said on each subject ...' Young's interest in natural history or machines was small and his lectures were the views of other more competent authors, or copied descriptions from other sources. But in natural philosophy, mechanics, and especially optics, he was well-informed, and included the latest research, continental as well as his own. In the three years after he left the Royal Institution, he worked on his lecture notes and compiled the huge bibliography that makes up the bulk of the second volume. Young must have worked directly from his notes when preparing them for publication; large sections appear verbatim in the published lectures. In was in these published notes that 'Young's Modulus' of elasticity is presented, as well as his famed experiment demonstrating the interference of light.

√âtienne-Louis Malus,"Malus, √âtienne-Louis",,1775-1812," ",Sur une propriete de la lumiere reflechie,"√âtienne-Louis Malus announces his discovery that light could be polarized by reflection.
","√âtienne-Louis Malus announced his discovery that light could be polarized by reflection in this issue of the Memoires de Physique et de Chimie de la Societe D'Arcueil. The Societe d'Arcueil was what would now be called an advanced research seminar in the physical sciences. It met every two weeks at Claude Louis Berthollet's summer home and laboratory in Arcueil, a southern suburb of Paris. Malus was a member and it was from this group that the project to establish a corpuscular theory of light that accounted for double refraction arose.  Malus began working on this question of double refraction produced by crystals in 1807 and and accidently found that light reflected off a plate of glass, had the same properties as the extraordinary refracted ray from crystals.  Specifically, he showed that reflected light behaved similarly to that which had passed through a piece of birefringent Icelandic spar. This revealed that light had acquired a property that it carried with it after passing through the crystal or being reflected. This property Malus called 'polarization.' The discovery had a profound effect upon optical thought, experiment, and research efforts, and appeared to bolster the case for the wave theory of light. His work ushered in a significant change in the development of physical optics that would culminate in Augustine Fresnel's work a decade later. Translations of Malus's article appeared in German at Leipzig in 1809 and in English at London in 1812.
","Malus begins with a recounting of his previous work with birefringent Icelandic spar. It has long been know that such crystals separated incident light into two different refracted beams. Malus found that these two beams were treated differently by a second crystal. He deduced that the first crystal was changing the characteristic of light; the two beams contained light that had some property that was different and that light carried this property with it after it left the first crystal. He then showed that this property could be produced in light upon reflection from glass or water. Malus held to the particle theory of light and believe that light particles had sides or poles and that the phenomenon he observed involved the orientation of these poles, attracted or repulsed by short-range forces within the crystal. In his next article he named the property created by Icelandic spar and by reflection 'polarization,' and that became the generally adopted term.","‚ÅÇ <i>The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light<i>|Buchwald, J.Z|University of Chicago Press, 1989, 474 pp, NB: pp 41-66.||Etienne-Louis Malus: The Polarization of Light by Refraction and Reflection is Discovered|Pelosi, G.|<i>IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine<i>, Vol 51, No 4, 2009, pp 226-228.||'The Search for a Corpuscular Theory of Double Refraction: Malus, Laplace and the Price Competition of 1808'|Frankel, E.|<i>Centaurus<i>, Vol 18, No 3, 1974, pp 223-245.||Etienne-louis Malus 1775-1812 Et La Theorie Corpusculaire De La Lumiere|Chappert, A.|Librairie Philosophique J.

The text was printed by the university and so its commissioning was undoubtedly part of that very large project.

The translation was by the journal's general editor, Ludwid Wilhelm Gilber, and is rather free but conveys all the essentials. This translation appeared less than two years after Malus' original article and demonstrates the importance and speed with which Malus' discovery spread throughout Europe.
","Malus begins with a recounting of his previous work with birefringent Icelandic spar. It has long been know that such crystals separated incident light into two different refracted beams. Malus found that these two beams were treated differently by a second crystal. He deduced that the first crystal was changing the characteristic of light; the two beams contained light that had some property that was different and that light carried this property with it after it left the first crystal. He then showed that this property could be produced in light upon reflection from glass or water. Malus held to the particle theory of light and believe that light particles had sides or poles and that the phenomenon he observed involved the orientation of these poles. In his next article he named the property created by Icelandic spar and by reflection 'polarization,' and that became the generally adopted term.","‚ÅÇ <i>The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light<i>|Buchwald, J.Z|University of Chicago Press, 1989, 474 pp, NB: pp 41-66.||Etienne-Louis Malus: The Polarization of Light by Refraction and Reflection is Discovered|Pelosi, G.|<i>IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine<i>, Vol 51, No 4, 2009, pp 226-228.||Etienne-louis Malus 1775-1812 Et La Theorie Corpusculaire De La Lumiere|Chappert, A.|Librairie Philosophique J.

William Hyde Wollaston,"Wollaston, William Hyde",,1766-1828,Translated by Karl Brandan Mollweide,Neue methode die brechenden und zerstreuenden kr√§fte  der korper vermittelst primatischer reflexion zu esforschen,"German recension of Wollaston's report on a procedure he had been using for some years to measure refractive index.
","Wollaston reports on a procedure he had been using for some years to measure refractive index, but had not seen described in the scientific literature. His ingenious device determined index of refraction by direct sighting and alignment with a protractor-type apparatus--giving the desired index directly. The measurement of refractive index had been of great practical importance for the previous half-century, being essential data required for achromatic lens design. A notable attempt at such measurements being Boscovich and his vitrometer. Wollaston's instrument was a significant improvement over all previous methods, methods which required measurement, calculation, and some uncertainty. It was the basis for similar instruments for a century. While using his instrument to investigate chromatic dispersion, Wollaston famously observed dark lines in the solar spectrum and detected what is now called ultraviolet radiation. Wollaston's paper appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society in 1802, was translated into French and appeared in the Annales de Chimie in 1803, and in German in the Annalen der Physik in 1809. The paper was widely read and reviewed and even the usually-negative Edinburgh Review praised the instrument and hailed the discovery of ultraviolet rays.
","Wollaston reports the development of a total internal reflection refractometer. Using Snell's law or refraction, and the nature of total internal reflection, the instrument could determine the index of refraction of any material brought into contact with a flint-glass prism. The incident angle measurement mechanism (that angle that just produced total internal reflection) was ingenious and permitted values to be determined to within a few parts in a thousand. The paper is in three parts: The description of its construction and use and a reporting of measurements of the indices of 80 substances; Use of the same instrument to investigate chromatic dispersion; An analysis of the dispersion of totally internally reflected sunlight. It is in the last section that Wollaston notes the appearance of dark lines in the solar spectrum; they are shown in the last figure that accompanies the article. In a footnote, Wollaston remarks (prompted by Herschel's infrared studies) the he detected active radiation beyond the violet end of the solar spectrum, capable of darkening silver chloride. He acknowledges a similar and simultaneous discovery by Johann Ritter in Germany. Remarkably, Wollaston concludes that sunlight consisted of 'six species of rays,' four visible and two invisible.","‚ÅÇ <i>Pure Intelligence: The Life of William Hyde Wollaston<i>|Usselman, M.|University of Chicago Press, 2015, 412 pp, NB: pp 67-79.","Neue methode die brechenden und zerstreuenden kr√§fte  der korper vermittelst primatischer reflexion zu esforschen.

","Wollaston reports on the use of his total internal reflection refractometer to measure the refractive indices of Icelandic spar in different planes of the crystal. He realized that this could be a test of Christian Huygens' prediction of light's propagation through the crystal. The results were is good agreement, and Wollaston very gingerly stated: 'The observations that I have made on this substance, accord throughout with this hypothesis of HUYGENS; the measures that I have taken, correspond more nearly than could well happen to a false theory . . .'  Wollaston's paper appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society in 1802, was translated into French and appeared in the Annales de Chimie in 1803, and in German in the Annalen der Physik in 1809. The paper was widely read and reviewed and, not surprisingly, with its usual abuse and sarcasm the Edinburgh Review stated it was 'disappointed to find, that so acute and ingenious an experimentalist had adopted the wild optical theory of vibrations.' Nevertheless, Wollaston's measurements and delicately-stated conclusion boosted the stock of the wave theory of light, and with this paper and the accompanying one on his refractometer, ushered in the new developments in optics that would take place in the 19th century.
","Wollaston reports being able to cut Icelandic spar in various planes and using such pieces in this total internal reflection refractometer. Transforming the measured angles with spherical trigonometry, the measured indices aligned with Huygens' proposed elliptical wavefronts for the special refraction in the crystal. The Annalen editor, Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert provided a long commentary and analysis that followed the translation of Wollaston's paper.","‚ÅÇ <i>Pure Intelligence: The Life of William Hyde Wollaston<i>|Usselman, M.|University of Chicago Press, 2015, 412 pp, NB: pp 67-79.","Ueber die schiefe brechung des islandischen krystalls.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von",,1749-1832," ",Zur Farbenlehre,"Goethe presents his theory of colors and the experiments that supported it. His interpretation of color experiments and the role of experiment itself, convinced Goethe that Newton's theory of light and color, with is foundation of prismatic color experiments, was wrong. White light was not heterogeneous; color was produced by the blending of light and dark.
","Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote <i>Zur Farbenlehre<i> nearly 20 years after his first publication on color, the <i>Beytrage zur Optik<i> of 1791. During the interval he had conducted extensive visual experiments involving color perception and developed his ideas regarding the role of experiment, set out in his essay of 1792: ‚ÄúDer Versuch als Vermittler von Objekt und Subjekt‚Äù--experiment as mediator between subject and object. For Goethe, experiment was not, as Newtonian science had it, the indifferent revealer of nature but an intermediary between nature and the investigator. His interpretation of color experiments and the role of experiment itself, convinced Goethe that Newton's theory of light and color, with is foundation of prismatic color experiments, was wrong. White light was not heterogeneous; color was produced by the blending of light and dark. Goethe's conviction of the correctness of his color theory and his antipathy to Newtonian science--its optics in particular--produced <i>Zur Farbenlehre<i>. The book was important not for the physical optics it proposed--which was rejected immediately and by nearly everyone--but for the aspects of color perception it clarified, and the ingenious color perception experiments is described. <i>Zur Farbenlehre<i> made clear that there was much more to color perception than what a prism detected: differing refraction. It was the initial step in the century-long process of separating color perception from mere physical or optical stimulus. This copy of the Atlas volume contains the plates of both the first and second editions of <i>Zur Farbenlehre<i>.
","Goethe's text is divided into three parts: Didactic part, A Polemic Unveiling of Newton's Theory, and A History of Color Theory. The material in the didactic part contains much of what was in the <i>Beytrage zur Optik<i> of 1791 and is in six chapters: Physiological Colors; Physical Colors; Chemical Colors; General Characteristics; Relation to Other Pursuits; Color Effects and Associations. The material in the Polemical part is in two chapters: Newton's <i>Opticks<i> Book I, Part I; Newton's <i>Opticks<i>, Book I, Part II. The material in the history part is in seven chapters: The Greeks, Romans, Medieval, 16th century, 17th century, 18th century from Newton to Dollond, 18th century from Dollond to the present. The principal method of investigation was vision through a prism, though other simple optical apparatus is also used: simple lenses, glass plates, colored papers. In all cases, the experiments are described in elegant and clear detail. Goethe interprets the lack of color of uniform light or dark fields viewed through a prism, and color's appearance only at light/dark boundaries, as perceptual evidence that color results from the mixing of light and dark. The polemical section is strikingly strident and makes clear how deeply Goethe opposed the rise of experimental empiricism. The history of color theory is remarkable for its emphasis on social and biographical context, its refusal to engage in what is now called 'Whig History,' the attention to transition times, and its appreciation of the linguistic aspects in which color theories were expressed.","‚ÅÇùëª <i>Theory of Colours<i>|Goethe, J.W. von, Eastlake, C.L., translator, Judd, D.B., Introduction|MIT Press, Cambridge, 1970.

","Malus' monograph on double refraction has its roots in his discovery of polarization by reflection in 1808. This, in turn, was part of his work for the prize competition established by the Institut de France early in 1808. The prize required that the winner 'give a mathematical theory verified by experiments of the double refraction which light undergoes in crossing different crystallized substances.'  This was an attempt to promote work that would bolster the corpuscular theory of light, popular in France and pursued by Laplace, Arago, Poisson, Biot and Gay-Lussac. Malus' early work not only discovered polarization by reflection but verified Huygens' Law regarding refraction and further supported the wave theory of light. Thus the Institute's prize competition.||Malus constructed a theory that involved forces acting on light corpuscles as very short distances and, when coupled with what was still an arbitrary assumption involving the elliptical range and power of these forces, produced the result equivalent to Huygens Law. This gave a reasonable, but still somewhat arbitrary basis for a corpuscular theory of double refraction. Malus won the prize for the 1808 competition, and as was the custom, the prize was awarded two years later and his memoire was published by the Institute.","Malus theory begins with the notion, generally accepted in France at the time, that optical phenomena need to be explained by the motions of particles subjected to central forces. The goal was a theory, admitting to these constraints, that produced the equivalent of Huygens Law. Malus begins with the principle of least action applied to a corpuscle of light entering a crystal and establishes an algebraic expression for its motion along the crystal's principal axis.  Malus then begs the question, as it were, and establishes the algebraic equivalent of Huygens' ellipse; an ellipsoid from which the path of the extraordinary ray could be determined on the basis of central forces. The result was obtained by Malus with a blizzard of algebra, and importantly, indicated that the force that produced the extraordinary ray was repulsive, while that producing the ordinary ray was attractive. Laplace developed a similar corpuscular theory for double refraction--equivalent to that of Malus. Both were accepted as explaining double refraction, without having to abandon light corpuscles and invoke waves. All this would soon be swept aside by Fresnel's work in the following decade.","‚ÅÇ The Search for a Corpuscular Theory of Double Refraction: Malus, Laplace and the Price Competition of 1808|Frankel, E.|<i>Centaurus<i>, Vol 18, No 3, 1974, pp 223-245.||√âtienne Louis Malus (1775-1812) et la Th√©orie Corpusculaire De La Lumi√®re|Chappert, A.|Librairie Philosophique J.

This is the text on optics in that series and one of the few English texts in the 18th century devoted solely to optics, the list of such texts is short: Smith in 1738, Benjamin Martin in 1740 and 1758, William Emerson in 1768, Harris posthumously in 1775, Higgins in 1776, and the first edition of Woods in 1799. Editions of Wood's text appeared in 1799, 1801, 1811, 1818, and 1828.||This copy was bound interleaved with blanks, enabling note-taking and working through examples.
","The material is covered in 13 chapters: The Nature of Light and its Propagation, Laws of Reflection, Laws of Refraction, Reflection at plane and spherical Surfaces, Images formed by Reflection, Refraction at plane and Spherical Surfaces, Images formed by Refraction, The Eye and eye-function, Optical Instruments, Chromatic Aberrations, Spherical Aberrations, The Rainbow, Caustics. Considering when it was written, the form is rather old-fashioned: a concise march of Definitions, Propositions, Corollaries, and Discussions in Scholia. The material is elementary, detailed, and based on physical principles expressed in geometry, trigonometry and ratios; with very few equations. The physical and geometric optics material relies heavily on Newton, the Opticks and Optical Lectures being cited frequently.||Importantly, Wood does not make extensive use of analysis; something which by this time the French had developed to high level in optics. Wood's work was at the cusp of the transition that brought continental analysis to Cambridge in particular and British university education in general.","William Whewell and Cambridge Mathematics|Becher, H.W.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 11, No 1, 1980, pp. 1-48.","The Elements of Optics designed for the use of students in the University.

Thomas Young,"Young, Thomas",,1773-1829,Translated by A. F. L√ºdicke,Ueber die Theorie des Lichts and Versuche und Berechnungen zur physicalischen Optik,"German translation of The second and third Bakerian lectures presented by Thomas Young. The second lecture proposed a wave theory of light, based on an oscillating luminiferous aether and the wave-front propagation principle described by Huygens more than century earlier. The third lectures described his experimental demonstration of light interference.","Though the Bakerian Lectures of Thomas Young were either ignored or opposed in Great Britain, Ludwig Wilheml Gilbert, editor of the <i>Annalen der Physik<i>, recognized their merit. The second of Young's lectures proposed the wave nature of light, the third lecture records his famous experiment demonstrating the interference of light in support of the wave theory. The second lecture appeared in the Philosophical Transactions in 1802 and the third lecture appeared in 1804. Gilbert and had them translated in German by A. F. L√ºdicke, someone who did much translating for the Annalen, and the appeared in the Annalen in 1811.","Thomas Young lays out a wave theory of light in four hypotheses, nine propositions, and five corollaries. The hypotheses are as follows. 1: An all-pervading aether; 2: Luminous object excite undulations in the aether; 3: Color sensation depends on the frequency of the vibrations; 4: Aether is absorbed in various densities in various bodies and a layer of aether surrounds bodies due to their attraction. The propositions are as follows. 1: All impulses propagate with the same velocity; 2: Single luminous points produce spherical undulations; 3: Undulations through an aperture propagate rectilinearly; 4: Undulations partially reflect at interfaces of media with different densities; 5: Undulations propagate across the interface of different media in directions given by Snell's law; 6: Undulations can suffer total internal reflection; 7: Undulation velocity is affected by particle vibrations within the medium; 8: Undulation motions combine; 9: Radiant light is undulations in the aether. The corollaries rely in an essential way on the hypothesis that the aether accumulates in and surrounds bodies; using the theory they explain the following: Colors of striated surfaces, colors of thin plates, colors of thick plates, blackness, inflected colors. In this sense, the lecture is as much about the distribution of the aether as it is about waves propagating through it. Using his theory, the data Newton provided for thin-plate colors, and a presumed velocity propagation, Young calculated and reported the wavelength and frequency associated with prismatic colors. They are remarkably accurate.","Men and Milestones in Optics II: Thomas Young|Barr, E.S.|<i>Applied Optics<i>, Vol 2, No 6, 1963, pp 639-647.||Was Thomas Young a wave theorist?|Cantor, G.N.|<i>American Journal of Physics<i>, Vol 52, No 4, 1984, pp 305-308.","Ueber die Theorie des Lichts and Versuche und Berechnungen zur physicalischen Optik.

At the time, the university had come under state control and was considered a 'Hohe Schule' that was charged with training officials, advocates, doctors, and clerics. Latin had become the prescribed language, rather than the vernacular of the previous half-century.  D√∂ttler's textbook reflects these constraints and the general step backward the university was forced to take.  D√∂ttler's textbook stands in considerable contrast to those of Karl Scherffer and P√°l Mak√≥ which had been used at the university. The material is blend of Newton and Boscovich, with some Euler and Kant. Editions appeared in 1812, 1815, and 1823.","D√∂ttler's textbook has three sections: General Physics, Particular Physics, and the Physics of Astronomy, Geography, and Meteorology. General Physics covers: Universal properties of bodies, simple and compound motion, direct and oblique collisions, gravity, projectile and pendulum motion, geostatics, hydrostatics, hydraulics, fluid motion. Particular Physics covers: Mechanical properties of the air and atmosphere, air motion, physics of light, the mathematics of light including optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics, optical instruments, heat and caloric phenomena, chemical analysis and synthesis, various types of air, electricity, galvanic piles, magnetics. Astronomy covers:  The system of the world, the Earth, meteorics. The optics material (62 pages) includes the following. Physical optics: The Newtonian and Eulerian theory of light and propagation, opaque and transparent materials, reflection and refraction, prismatic colors, colors and pigments, object colors, diffraction. Geometrical optics: direct light and shadows, apparent size, lenses and their foci, calculating lenses, plane and spherical mirrors, the eye and eye-function, camera obscura, telescopes, microscopes. The style is descriptive, the material is elementary, very concise, and analytic only in the treatment of lenses and mirrors.

Leonhard Euler,"Euler, Leonhard",,1707-1783,"Translated by Jean-Baptiste Labey (1750-1825) French mathematician, professor at l'√âcole militaire de Paris.",Lettres aÃÄ une princesse d'Allemagne,"An edited collection of the 234 letters Euler wrote at the request of Frederick II of Prussia as a form of tutoring Frederick's niece, princess Sophie. The cover nearly all of natural philosophy, philosophy, logic, and important physical questions of Euler's time.
","At the invitation of Frederick II of Prussia, Euler joined the Berlin Academy In 1741 and stayed until 1766. Frederick asked Euler to be a scientific tutor to his niece, Princess Sophie, who lived in Magdeburg. Euler obliged, writing between April 1760 and May 1762, 234 letters in French to the Princess. Beginning in 1762, there was tension between Frederick and Euler, and likely explains whey the letters were not published until Euler was in Saint Petersburg beginning in June 1766. The Lettres were published in Russia in French, their language of composition and the second language of most of Europe. Their popular style, scope, and clarity of presentation allowed them to reach a large readership. The first two volumes of the Lettres appeared in 1768 and the last in 1772. While in Russia, Euler prepared the first German translation, while between 1768 and 1774 Euler‚Äôs student Stepan Rumovskij translated the Letters from French into Russian, the first of five Russian editions leading up to 1808. By 1800 they had gone through thirty editions and were translated into seven other languages: Danish, Dutch, English, German, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish.|| The Lettres present Euler's mature positions on matters of natural philosophy, benefitting from earlier research and speculations. He begins simply but moves quickly to more difficult topics. Euler assumed his reader had little knowledge of natural philosophy or mathematics and so the Letters contain no mathematics. Important are Euler's examples; the text showing his insight, how he worked through problems, and the clarity of his explanations.
","The initial three topics of the Lettres‚Äîextension, velocity, and sound‚Äîwere among the 79 dealing with general physical science and comprise the first of three natural divisions of the Lettees. The first division contains Letter 1-79.  Letters 4 to 17 proceeded to music, the air, and the atmosphere. Lettres 17 to 45 explained light, first considering the systems of Descartes and Newton on the subject. Euler rejected both and proceeded to his pulse theory, then to optics generally, the theory of colors, dioptrics, reflection, vision, and the structure of the eye. His opposition to Newton‚Äôs corpuscular optics did not mean that Euler was anti-Newtonian, rather he found fault with Newton's optics on questions of reflection and refraction.  Euler treated light as analogous to sound, as a vibration in the aether. Since the time of Galileo Galilei Light's speed had not been thought to be instantaneous. Euler calculated a value of light speed very close to the modern accepted value. The aether appears in Lettre 19 and Euler used it to explain most physical phenomena, including mechanical, optical, magnetic, and electrical. Lettres 45 to 79 addressed gravity and its effects, along with mechanics, cosmology, the tides, and the theory of matter.||The second division contains Lettres 80-133 and presents inquires into philosophy, religion, and logic. The third division contains Lettres 134 to 234 and is devoted entirely to physical questions. Electricity in 138-154, navigation and the longitude problem 155-169, and magnetism in 169-187.","<i>Leonhard Euler: Mathematical Genius in the Enlightenment<i>|Calinger, R.S.|Princeton University Press, 2016, 696 pp, NB: pp 461-469.||Leonhard Euler's Wave Theory of Light|Pdeersen, K.M.|<i>Perspectives on Science<i>, Vol 16, No 4, 2008, pp 392-416.","Lettres aÃÄ une princesse d'Allemagne, sur divers sujets de physique et de philosophie Par L.

","Malus begins with a recounting of his previous work with birefringent Icelandic spar. It has long been know that such crystals separated incident light into two different refracted beams. Malus found that these two beams were treated differently by a second crystal. He deduced that the first crystal was changing the characteristic of light; the two beams contained light that had some property that was different and that light carried this property with it after it left the first crystal. He then showed that this property could be produced in light upon reflection from glass or water. Malus held to the particle theory of light and believe that light particles had sides or poles and that the phenomenon he observed involved the orientation of these poles. In his next article he named the property created by Icelandic spar and by reflection 'polarization,' and that became the generally adopted term.","‚ÅÇ <i>The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light<i>|Buchwald, J.Z|University of Chicago Press, 1989, 474 pp, NB: pp 41-66.||Etienne-Louis Malus: The Polarization of Light by Refraction and Reflection is Discovered|Pelosi, G.|<i>IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine<i>, Vol 51, No 4, 2009, pp 226-228.||Etienne-louis Malus 1775-1812 Et La Theorie Corpusculaire De La Lumiere|Chappert, A.|Librairie Philosophique J.

Bourgeois held that object colors and colors produced by pigment mixing and dying were incompatible with Newton's prismatic colors and the idea of heterogeneous white light. Bourgeois produced a series of experiments described in this and subsequent memoirs, interpreting the results as refuting the core of Newton's theory of light and color. This and several subsequent memoirs were submitted to the Royal Academy of Sciences for review by Fran√ßois Arago, Jean-Baptiste Biot, Ren√©-Just Ha√ºy, Andr√© Amp√®re, and Augustin Fresnel. After a first reading, Arago suggested that Bourgeois provide an analysis of the color theories of Brougham, Newton, de Gauthier, and Marat. Bourgeois complied and this is the reason for the second part of the printed version. Though Biot and Amp√®re were commissioned to review and report on Bourgeois' memoires, nothing was produced. The Academy ignored the memoires and when pushed by Bourgeois, Amp√®re wrote to him: ‚Äò‚ÄòWhat you have imagined is just a piece of nonsense.‚Äô‚Äô
","Bourgeois describes a series of experiments involving sunlight, mirrors, prisms, lenses, and colored fluid filters. From the results he construes two types of reflection, refraction, and diffraction: simple and complex. In each case the 'simple' type results in colorless light, the 'complex' one generates color. Simple or complex is determined by the geometry of the surfaces involved; whether planar or curved. From these experiments and his own work with pigments, he proposes a primary color system of yellow, blue, and red. He further proposes that all colors contain some component of white and that when properly mixed and in equilibrium, these colors 'decompose each other' and leave only white. In this way he attempts to explain his own and Newton's experimental results. The experimental are presented only descriptively, no measurement are made, no quantitative data  generated, and no mathematics of any kind is used. All of these aspects of the memoire generated a negative reaction from virtually everyone in the academic and scientific community.","‚ÅÇ Charles Bourgeois (1759-1832), his Antinewtonian Colour Theory and the Reconcilement of Art and Science|Mertens, J.|<i>Nuncius <i>, Vol 22, No 1, 2007, pp 15 ‚Äì 48.","MeÃÅmoire sur les couleurs de l'iris, produites par la reÃÅflexion de la lumineÃÄre.

He had already worked extensively on the optical properties of materials, the lenses of microscopes and telescopes, and the phenomenon of polarized light. Brewser's first paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society appeared in 1813. Much of this material was summarized, and the instrumental parts of it detailed, in this  treatise on instruments. It was Brewster's first book; he was 32 years old.||The material dealing with instruments recounts Brewster's work to improve performance and practicality including, achromatic lenses, micrometers, telescopes, and microscopes. It contains an introduction to those topics that would occupy Brewster for the next 55 years and be the topic of many of the nearly 1000 published works he produced.","Brewster's treatise is in five books. Book 1: On micrometers, Book 2: On Instruments for the measuring angles when the eye is not at their vertex, Book 3: On Instruments for measuring distances, Book 4: On optical instruments for different purposes, in which the rays are transmitted through fluids, and Book 4: On new telescopes and microscopes.  Book two on angle measurement is driven, in part, by Brewster's understanding the need for accurate angular chromatic dispersion data for materials, if the optical properties of lenses was to be improved. Book four is the longest and summaries many of the experiments Brewster had already conducted to determine the dispersive power of optical materials. Six sets of extensive tables are included. Book five is devoted principally to the improvement of the microscope. Form, illumination systems, use of fluids, and lens improvements are considered.","Brewster on the Nature of Light|Cantor, G.N.|In:  <i>Martyr of Science, Sir David Brewster 1701-1868 <i>|Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh, 1984, pp 67-76.||'Brewster, David'|Hentschel, K.|In: Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers|Hockey, T., and others, editors|Springer, 2014, pp 310-314.","A Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments for Various Purposes in the Arts and Sciences with Experiments on Light and Colours.

","Christian Heinrich Pfaff wrote a paper that appeared in 1812 in the Journal f√ºr Chemie und Physik. In it he reported color experiments with birefringent crystals and showed how the results disproved Wolfgang van Goethe‚Äôs color theory both generally and particularly. Pfaff's <i>Newton's Farbentheorie<i> of 1813 was a direct development of that paper, written to report Pfaff's additional experiments and give a general refutation of Goethe's theory of colors. Pfaff's book is remarkable in that he was a respected and well-known members of scientific circles (famed for his work in chemistry and electricity) and a confirmed Newtonian, but was seriously and sufficiently interested in Goethe's theory to study it carefully and derive experiments to test its validity. By the time Pfaff's book appeared, Goethe's <i>Zur Farbenlehre<i> of 1810 had been reviewed in the scientific literature and roundly dismissed. But Pfaff was the first to study the theory and test it with experiments and to trouble himself to write an extended analysis, rather than simply pronounce Goethe's theory contrary to received wisdom.
","Pfaff reports a series of experiments, both simple and complex, that give results incompatible with Goethe's theory of color. Each of books chapters describes these. 2: Goethe's ur-phenomenon is doubtful. 3: Refutation of Goethe's theory of secondary images. 4: Refutation of Goethe's description of the colored sun image. 5: Proof that colored rays already exist in the prism. 6: Lens phenomena refute Goethe's theory. 7: Newton's theory of heterogeneous white light defended against the objections of the new doctrine. 8: Different refrangibility of different colored rays proved by new experiments and Goethe's objects refuted. 9: The influence of margins on color formation. 10: The Occult qualities of Goethe's theory. 11: Remarks about Newton's presentation of his theory. In addition there are 4 appendices on technical details. The material is very detailed, especially the technical details of the experiments. The interpretation of the results is straightforward and Pfaff explains how they refute Goethe's ideas, particularly the special pleading that often characterized arguments in support of Goethe's theory.","Another Kind of Light: The Work of T.J.

In the preface he states that the memoire is a text based on a lecture he developed for his students dealing exclusively with refraction and its cause. Magarotto mentions that although many texts present the law of refraction, almost none present a theory as to its cause. The text is interesting and unusual in that it reviews the history of refraction and is devoted exclusively and in detail to this single topic in physical optics.
","Magarotto begins with an historical review of refraction as considered by authors ranging from Aristotle, Alhacen, and Vitello, to Leibniz, and many major optical authors in between. The historical citations are extensive: the work of Kepler, Voss, Snell, and Descartes are considered and gives a segue to Leibniz's theory, which he presented in his paper Unicum Opticae Catoptricae & Dioptricae Principium and which Magarotto considers in detail. Finally, Newton's theory based on attractive forces is presented.

The first explication of ""Brewster's Angle.""","David Brewster's famed paper that presents the relationship between partial and complete polarization, the index of refraction of the reflecting medium, and the angles of incidence and refraction. An unwearying experimenter in optics, Brewster took immediate notice of the 1812 announcement of Malus that light could be polarized by reflection and conducted an extensive series of experiments. The result allowed him to formulate the geometric and optical conditions of polarization, the most famous is the eponymous Brewster's Angle.
","David Brewster used his considerable skill with instruments to conduct a large number of experiments involving transparent materials of various refractive indices, the geometry of incidence and refraction, and the measurement of polarization by reflectance. His experiments involved: polarization by front surface reflection from transparent materials, second surface reflection, polarization by reflection at media interfaces, polarization by successive reflections, practical polarization of heterogeneous light by reflection. From his experimental results Brewster adduced 29 propositions. The central result was expressed by what is now called Brewster's Angle; the relationship between the index of refraction of the reflecting material and the incidence angle at which reflected light is maximally linearly polarized. He also made clear the fact that heterogeneous light could not be completely polarized by reflection at any one angle since the index of refraction varied for its constituents. Though Brewster claims to make no hypothetical assumptions, several of his propositions involve Newton's idea of attractive force as the cause of refraction.","Brewster on the Nature of Light|Cantor, G.N.|In:  <i>Martyr of Science, Sir David Brewster 1701-1868 <i>|Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh, 1984, pp 67-76.","""On the laws which regulate the polarization of light by reflexion from transparent bodies"" In: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

More than 600 of the work's nearly 2400 pages are devoted to optics.
","Jean-Baptiste Biot's preface makes clear his intention for writing the <i>TraiteÃÅ de Physique ExpeÃÅrimentale et MatheÃÅmatique<i>: to produce a durable reference to the principal parts of physics. He gathered the very latest information in the areas he chose to cover and wrote in descriptive detail on each, contacting authors (or in the cases of Lavoisier and Ampere, their widows) to obtain manuscripts and other material. Biot‚Äôs <i>TraiteÃÅ<i> covers gases, fluids, acoustics, electricity, light, magnetism, and heat. Areas in which he was interested and in which he had conducted research. For this reason the TraiteÃÅ lacks coherency and alternates between large principles and minute details.  One of Biot's abiding interests was optics, particularly the phenomenon of polarization; more than 600 of the work's nearly 2400 pages are devoted to optics. But Biot held to a molecular-corpuscular theory of light, as did his mentor Laplace, and all that would be swept aside in just a few years by Fresnel and his wave theory of light. The <i>TraiteÃÅ<i> is not bristling with mathematics, as was common in French works of that time. Biot mentions his intention to avoid elaborate mathematics when descriptions suffice, unless the mathematics can connect disparate phenomena or expresses a general law. In addition to the edition of 1816, a German translation appeared at Leipzig in 1825 and 1828 and a Spanish translation at Madrid in 1826.
","Biot's material is in seven books gathered in four volumes. Vol 1 Book 1: General phenomena and observations, including the properties, manipulations, and measurements involving fluids and gases. Vol 2 book 2: Acoustics, including production and propagation of sound, instruments, acoustics in bodies, the voice. Vol 2 Book 3: Electricity, including attraction and repulsion, instruments, electric piles, light from electricity.

The optics material on geometrical optics is is brief, if not cursory, and very elaborate on physical optics, particularly on the nature of light polarization.

Augustin-Jean Fresnel,"Fresnel, Augustin-Jean",,1788-1827," ",Memoire sur la diffraction de la lumiere,"The second memoire Fresnel wrote, summarizing work in optics he began in early in 1815. He had not yet fully embraced either a wave theory of light and so this memoir was still essentially ray-based.
","Augustin-Jean Fresnel began optics work early in 1815, experimenting, gathering data, and formulating an equation-based theory that would explain the position of the light and dark fringes produced by diffraction. Over approximately two years, Fresnel successfully produced such a theory. During that time he produced two memoires, neither of which were published until his Oeuvres were published in 1866. During this time Fresnel was in communication with Francois Arago of the Academy of Sciences, to whom the second memoire had been submitted for review by the Academy. Arago suggested some additional data-taking which Fresnel performed. The revised memoir was subsequently published. Fresnel had not yet fully embraced either a wave theory of light or Huygens‚Äôs Principle for its propagation, his early theory described in this memoir was still essentially ray-based. The agreement between prediction and measurement of fringe positions was convincingly accurate, something which both encouraged Fresnel and attracted the attention of the French scientific circle. This was Fresnel‚Äôs first publication and  would be followed by a ground-breaking series that would mark his subsequent very rapid advances and ultimately result in a complete transverse wave theory of light that would sweep aside all others. This memoire was reprinted in Fresnel's Oeuvres of 1866.
","Fresnel's early theory was based on the assumption of the interaction of rays and though it did not promote a wave theory, it did make clear that diffraction was a phenomenon independent of the nature of the diffractor, depending only upon its size. This meant that diffraction was not the result of the interaction of light molecules (as they were referred to at the time) and forces produced by the diffracting body. It was for this purpose that Fresnel devised his eponymous Fresnel Mirrors; mirrors slight out of coplanarity, each reflecting half the light emanating from a diffracting slit to the same place on a screen and producing fringes. All of this lead to the notion that diffraction fringes were interference fringes. This publication lacks the elaborate mathematics would would later mark Fresnel's papers. Though he was very proficient in mathematics, he states in the memoire that he considered it a small virtue to use elaborate mathematics (the calculus in particular) to give algebraic or geometric results that could be obtained by simple reasoning and analysis of data.

Fraunhofer's paper was internationally influential, and changed optical measurement practice throughout the technical world.
","Joseph Fraunhofer wrote the <i>Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten<i> in 1814-1815. He had been directing all aspects of glass production of the Bavarian Optical Institute at BenediktBeuren, the secularized Benedictine monastery in Bavaria. It was producing the largest flawless blanks of the finest high refractive index flint glass in the world. As had been clear to Boscovich, Clairaut, and D'Alembert before him, Fraunhofer knew that what was required to produce fine achromatic lenses was not only flawless glass but an accurate knowledge of its dispersion; that is, its index of refraction for light throughout the spectrum. With the discovery of the narrow dark lines in the solar spectrum--the eponymous Fraunhofer lines--he was able to accurately measure their refractive shift in a glass sample, and from that accurately determine the glass's dispersion. Fraunhofer's process and instruments allowed him to determine refractive indices with a precision of one part in 1,000,000. No previous method could do better than one part in 1,000. This high-precision data about glass allowed the Optical Institute to produce the largest and finest achromatic lenses in the world. Fraunhofer's paper was internationally influential, and changed optical measurement practice throughout the technical world. Its influence was broader than instrumentational; it make clear the role and benefit of technology guided by craft and artisanal skill of the highest order.||Fraunhofer's article first appeared in Denkschriften der k√∂niglichen Academie der Wissenschaften zu M√ºnchen f√ºr die Jahre 1814 und 1815, Vol 5, which was published in 1817. It was much more widely known after its appearance in the Annalen der Physik, New Series, Vol 26, of 1817. English and French translations appeared in 1823.
","Fraunhofer begins his article with a clear statement of the then-urgent need for a way to accurately determine refractive index of glass through the visible spectrum. His initial experiment was an ingenious variant of the method used by Clairaut 50 years earlier: establish the narrowest possible samples of the spectrum--what would now be called monochromatic light--and used them to determine the index of fraction of a glass sample. Rather than use color filters, Fraunhofer use six alcohol burning lamps, each illuminating a prism through narrow slits at a range of incidence angle . The incidence angles were such that a different portion of the prismatic spectrum of each lamp was sent in the same general direction toward a distant prism of the glass being measured, behind which was positioned a modified theodolite to accurately measure the angle produced by refraction in the sample. From this angle the index of refraction could be calculated. But however narrow the slit there was always sufficient spread and overlap to diminish the final precision. Then Fraunhofer used the sun as a single light source and discovered a continuous spectrum with narrow dark lines. Experiment showed the lines to be inherent and in fixed in positions in the solar spectrum and so could be used as precise spectral markers. Rather than use a narrow sample of the spectrum, Fraunhofer used its fixed, much more narrow dark lacunae. Indices of refraction could be determined to one part in 1,000,000. The article contains tables of values of indices for several optical materials.","‚ÅÇ  <i>Spectrum of Belief: Joseph Von Fraunhofer and the Craft of Precision Optics <i>|Jackson, M.W.|MIT Press, 2000, pp 59-74.||From Theodolite to Spectral Apparatus|Jackson, M.W.|In:  <i>Instrumentation: Between Science, State, and Industry <i>, Joerges, B., Shinn, T., editors|Kluwer, 2001, 270 pp, NB: pp 17-29.||Buying the Dark Lines of the Solar Spectrum|Jackson, M.W.|In:  <i>Archimedes, Scientific Credibility and Technical Standards <i>, Buchwald, J.Z., editor|Kluwer, 1997, 178 pp, NB: pp 1-23.","""Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten, in Bezug auf die Vervollkommnung achromatischer Fernr√∂hre""  In: Annalen der Physik, New Series, Vol 26, pp 264-313.","""Determination of the refractions and color-dispersion properties of various types of glass, with respect to the improvement of acrhomatic telescopes.""",,1817,1800-1825,"German optician, glass and lens maker of revoluationary skill.",1,1817,Stamp of the British Museum of Natural History and 'Withdrawn' stamp,House of Johann Abrosius Barth,Leipzig,,,,,œÄ¬≤ ‚ãÜ‚ãÜ‚Å¥ A-Z‚Å¥ Aa-Ee‚Å¥,"[ùüôùüö] [(1)] (2)-(440) ",Plates [I-V],,Later 3/4 Gray Calf Over Marbled Boards,8,190,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1817 Fraunhofer - Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten - Images.JPG,Title Page,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1817 Fraunhofer - Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten - Images 2.JPG,,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1817 Fraunhofer - Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreungs-Verm√∂gens verschiedener Glasarten - Images 3.JPG,,http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15065z/f276.item,625,Herman H.J.

Giuseppe Settele,"Settele, Giuseppe",,1770-1841," ",Elementi di ottica e di astronomia,"A textbook on optics that was part of a larger project which included a textbook on astronomy. The text covers only the principles, indicates sources for further study, and provides some history. A strikingly modern idea of the role of teaching, teachers, and textbooks.
","Giuseppe Settele wrote this textbook on optics as part of a larger project which included a textbook on astronomy. He wrote with a very specific idea of what an introductory text for a single course should attempt and what its style should be. In his prefatory letter to the reader, Settele states that given limited time and attention, an optics text should cover only the principles, indicate sources for further study, provide some history, and prepare  'the young scholar' so that he can discover how much he does not know and how much more he needs to learn. It is a strikingly modern idea of the role of teaching, teachers, and textbooks. Though the grouping and coverage of subjects was innovative, generally the text is traditional, still including, for example, a large section on perspective; other textbooks had long ago separated perspective from optics. And Settele was unaware of Fresnel's work. There was considerable difficulty getting the Imprimatur for the second volume (on astronomy), owing to Settele's embracing and fully explaining the Copernican system. It was Settele's tussle to get permission to print his textbook and his appeal to the Holy See which in 1820 finally  prompted it to remove any stricture on the belief or teaching of the Copernican system.
","The material is covered in 11 chapters and an appendix with 3 additional chapters. 1: The principal properties of light. 2: Foci of reflected and refracted rays. 3: Images formed by reflection and refraction. 4: Caustics of reflection and refraction. 5: Images from conic mirrors. 6: The eye and formation of images. 7: Spectacles. 8: Dioptric telescopes. 9: Catadioptric telescopes. 10: Microscopes. 11: Achromatic lenses. The appendix contains, 1: The rainbow. 2: Singular phenomena produced by reflection and refraction. 3: Perspective. The material builds as it proceeds, and avoids the leaps which Settele finds 'so fatal in the treatises of the exact sciences.' Settele often does not draw conclusions or provide detailed derivations, inviting the reader to work them out. Most sections contain a history of the topic, a background Settele believes necessary. The material on physical optics is very concise, sighting Descartes and Newton without plumping for any particular theory, but the cause of reflection and refraction is assigned to attractive and repulsive forces. The second chapter of the appendix discusses double refraction. Most of the material is on geometric optics with an emphasis on the analysis of lenses for dioptric instruments and the images produced by lenses and mirrors. Settele even describes Alhacen's solution to Alhacen's Problem. The style is descriptive and highly analytic, invoking the calculus when necessary.","Giuseppe Settele and the final annulment of the decree of 1616 against Copernicanism|Casanovas, J.|<i>Memorie della Societ√† Astronomia Italiana <i>, Vol. 60, No 4, 1989,  pp 791-805.",Elementi di ottica e di astronomia del Canonico Giuseppe Settele Professore nell' Archiginnasio Romno.

Amici discovered the principal drawback of Wollaston's design: the field of view was exceedingly small, and the image disappeared with slight movement of the observer's eye. Amici devised five ways to improve the device and reported his work in a paper read before the Modena Royal Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts on 27 February 1818. It was published in the Opuscoli Scientifici at Bologna in 1819. The present article is the offprint and is an example of Amici's ingenuity in the design of optical instrument in general and his inventiveness in the form and use of prims in particular. 
","Aimci's most successful improvement for the camera lucida was to bring light from a scene at 45 degrees incidence to a glass plate by total internal reflection within an isosceles prism.

Augustin-Jean Fresnel,"Fresnel, Augustin-Jean",,1788-1827," ",Memoire sur la diffraction de la lumiere,"Fresnel's memoire submitted for the prize announced by the French Academy in 1817 for a memoire explaining diffraction. Fresnel had adopted a wave theory based on Huygens‚Äôs Principle which he used to predict diffraction fringe placement and size. The agreement between Fresnel‚Äôs measurements and predictions were spectacular and his memoire was awarded the prize; the Memoire Couronn√©.
","Augustin-Jean Fresnel's memoire submitted for the prize announced by the French Academy in 1817 for a memoire explaining diffraction. The original language of the prize announcement appeared to limit submissions to those based on rays or corpuscular theories of light, but Francois Arago wrangled a change that allowed Fresnel's work to be considered. Since the publication of his first memoir on diffraction in 1816, Fresnel's work has advanced in three significant ways: he had embraced Huygens‚Äôs Principle for modelling light propagation, thus abandoning rays and their interaction, he had increased the precision with which he measured the positions of diffraction fringe maxima, and he constructed a computational framework based on Huygens‚Äôs Principle of sufficient complexity to predict fringe maxima. From this latter development came the eponymous Fresnel Integrals. The agreement between Fresnel‚Äôs measurements and predictions were spectacular and his memoire was awarded the prize; the Memoire Couronn√©. Fresnel's work was a conceptual and analytic triumph; the wave-based theory of light could no longer be set aside. This printing of the Memoire Couronn√© did not include the introduction in which Fresnel delineated why a ray or corpuscular theory of light could not be correct. Fresnel's long work is printed in two parts in Volume 11 of the Annales de Chimie et de Physique; pp 246-295 and 337-376. The memoire was printed in full by the French Academy in 1826 and in the Oeuvres of 1866. J.C. Poggendorff's German translation appeared in the Annalen der Physik und Chemie in 1836 and an English translation in 1900.
","Fresnel began the memoire delineating reasons why a ray or corpuscular theory of light cannot be correct, the essential problem being that rays and corpuscles are independent and only mechanical interactions can be used to explain optical phenomena. The rest of the memoire is essentially a series of lectures, giving background and detail appropriate for readers not familiar with wave analysis. The topics, in turn, are: all 'rays' are involved in diffraction, not just those near the diffractor; Huygens's Principle permits the necessary interactions to be modelled; a diffractor blocks part of an otherwise full wavefront and the resulting sub-wavefronts generate interference fringes; positions of fringe maxima can be predicted only by incorporating (integrating) the phase interactions along the wavefront that is not blocked by the diffractor; derivation of the integrals that express the necessary phase interactions; comparison of predictions of position of fringe maxima with experimental measurement. Fresnel's analyses included fringes produced by a half-infinite diffractor, a narrow slit, and a narrow diffractor. In most cases the agreement with position measurements was withing 1.5%.","‚ÅÇ  <i>The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light <i>|Buchwald, J.Z|University of Chicago Press, 1989, 474 pp, NB: pp 168-183.||Memoir on the Diffraction of Light 'Crowned' by the French Academy of Sciences in 1819 by A.

Hoping for his books to appear in print in Mexico, he sent a copy of his manuscript to Mexico City, dedicated to San Ildefonso College. Interestingly, rather than in the vernacular of his homeland, he wrote in Latin, hoping to prompt its study and so provide students with access to the vast literature of the humanities. The blend of philosophy, metaphysics, theology, and natural philosophy had the books widely used in Catholic schools.

","Fourth edition of Jean Gabriel Augustin Chevallier's text which first appeared in 1810. This edition, with its 511 pages, is a vast extension of the edition of 1810 which has 163 pages. It begins with the same brief instructional material, but the material devoted to practical optics and opticians is greatly expanded, as is the trade catalogue that appears at the end. New to this edition is an extensive optical vocabulary. Though the ultimate commercial purpose of the book is that same as that of the edition of 1810, the scope, level of detail, technical nature, and extent of information is considerably greater. By this time, Chevallier's firm was producing the finest microscopes available in Europe; achromatic doublets were combined to provide high magnification which was a significant advance since the small lens size and high curvature made achromatic microscope lenses difficult to make.
","The 'custodian of vision' of the title is the optician and the spectacles he can provided. Chevallier treatise begins with an elementary description of the anatomy of the eye and its optical function. Normal vision, common visual deficiencies, and diseases of the eye are then described. This is followed by a 'Manual of the Optician-Engineer' which is a long, self-contained section on optical aids of various types and how to chose them, including all types of lenses, spectacles, lunettes, magnifiers, glasses, and Franklin's bifocal spectacles. The microscope and other magnifiers are also described as well as the achromatic lens. A thirty-five page Vocabulary of Optics follows, which gives definitions for most words commonly used in optics. Then is a 170 page catalogue of optical instruments. The book ends with a forty pages of extracts from journals and letters pertaining to practical optics.","Chevallier'|Blancheton, E.|<i>Revue G√©n√©rale, Biographique, Politique et Litteraire <i>, Vol 5, 1843, pp 207-291.||The Moon for a twopence: street telescopes in nineteenth-century Paris and the epistemology of popular  stargazing|Aibin, D.|<i>Early Popular Visual Culture <i>, Vol 15, No 2, pp 125-151.||http://www.microscopist.net/ChevallierJGA.html","Le Conservateur de la vue, suivi du manuel de l'ingeÃÅnieur-opticien.

The result of his studies after he left the military in 1814 and his promise given in his mechanics book of 1819, to treat light from a mechanical point of view. The text deals exclusively with physical optics and rejects all radiant and action-at-a-distance theories, including the emission of Newtonian particles. Nobili's treatment of physical optics is based entirely of the supposition of vibrations in a pervading aether and the actions of attractive and repulsive forces. Pulses, such as those proposed by Euler are equated with light. Somewhat like the French theories of Fresnel and Cauchy, but based more closely on Biot, Nobili attempts to construct and entirely mechanical foundation for physical optics. But without any mathematics, French or otherwise, Nobili's elaborate treatise had little effect on optics. Though his strengths may not have been in theory, he was a master experimentalist and instrument maker. He would establish the science of electro-chemical colored optical coating, what he called 'metallocromia.'","The text begins with a 'Prospectus of Optics' followed by 9 Articles and a Conclusion. 1: On Reflection. 2: On Refraction. 3: On Color in General. 4: On the Permanent Colors of Bodies. 5: On Prismatic Colors. 6: Colors of Lamina 7: On Diffraction. 8: On Double Refraction 9: Extraordinary Vibrations that Couple with Ordinary Ones of Light, or The Polarization of Light. The prospectus presents Nobili's overarching theory of the nature of light, based entirely of the supposition of vibrations in a pervading aether generated by luminous objects and the actions of attractive and repulsive forces on those vibrations. The principle phenomena of physical optics--reflection, refraction, diffraction, double refraction, polarization--are described as resulting from vibrations the aether being affected by attractive and repulsive forces produced by and linking to physical objects such as glass, metal, air, and crystals.

Completed in June of 1821, Fresnel's essay was the most comprehensive statement of his work in optics. Unlike the extracts and short articles to which he had been limited in the Annales de Chimie et Physique, Fresnel was given ample space to develop a full, detailed, and clear statement of his wave theory of light. Publication of the essay made the theory's description available to wide audience of technical readers, not just physicists and not just French scientific circles. Poggendorff published its German translation in the Annalen der Physik in 1825-1828. And Thomas Young's English translation was published by David Brewster in the Quarterly Journal of Science in 1827-1829. John Herschel read Fresnel's essay and to a large, but not complete extent, incorporated Fresnel's ideas in his own essay 'Light' which was generally available by 1828 and published in the <i>Encyclop√¶dia Metropolitana<i> in 1830. Fresnel's essay became the most important instrument for the dissemination of his complete wave theory of light, which within 10 years was accepted by nearly the entire European scientific community.
","Fresnel's essay contains sections on the nature of light, diffraction, thin-film interference, reflection and refraction, double refraction and polarization, chromatic polarization, and modification of polarization by reflection.  He developed in detail the wave theory of light he had described in summaries and extracts in the short memoires he had published in the Annals de Chemie et de Physique between 1816 and 1822.  Fresnel showed how his wave theory successfully explained and predicted all then-known optical phenomena except chromatic dispersion. In was in this essay that the full explanation of transverse waves was presented and a full description of polarized light was given. With it, Fresnel's complete wave theory of light was described in sufficient detail for other to follow, consider, and work on and marked the beginning of the wave theory of light's general acceptance in science.

","Poli's work attempts to present a complete course of experimental physics. Being somewhat eclectic, there are parts of the material that were already quite dated when it first appeared. The presentation of the Phlogiston theory of heat and the Cartesian nature of light are examples; by 1780, physicists had abandoned both theories. Nevertheless, the work was widely popular and used throughout Italy. It was revised, reprinted, and condensed  in many subsequent editions. Twenty-three editions appeared between 1781 and 1837.

Art 6: Perception and aspects of View. Considering physical optics, Art 1 presents the Cartesian, Eulerian, and Newton hypotheses on the nature of light. Without settling the issue, Poli adopts light rays as a useful description of light for all practical purposes. He quotes the discover of R√∏mer as showing that light propagates in finite time, and several experiments that show it travels in straight lines. Dioptrics is described in geometric terms and its principles lead to the understanding of Lenses and their operation. Convex and concave lenses are discussed. Double refraction and polarization is mentioned, but aberrations are not. Art 5 presents elementary ocular anatomy and vison function. The material in Lessons XXVI-XXVI present Optical instruments include the microscope, magic lantern, telescope, and various types of mirrors.

Joseph Fraunhofer,"Fraunhofer, Joseph",,1787-1826," ",Neue Modifikation des Lichtes,Fraunhofer presents the first quantitative discussion of the diffraction of light.¬†,"Fraunhofer had described his discovery of the narrow dark lines in the solar spectrum--the Fraunhofer lines--in his paper of 1817. By 1821 Fresnel‚Äôs work on the wave theory of light and interference had become widely known and and so Fraunhofer published two papers in which he observed and analyzed certain diffraction phenomena and interpreted them in terms of a wave theory of light. In the 1821 paper, contained in this volume of the Denkschriften, he discussed his examination of the spectra resulting from light diffracted through a single narrow slit and quantitatively related the width of the slit to the angles of dispersion of the different orders of spectra. An offprint of the paper appeared in 1821, the year Fraunhofer presented the paper. The Denkschriften was printed only every three years, so Fraunhofer's diffraction work did not appear in the journal until 1824.","In this paper Fraunhofer discussed his examination of the spectra resulting from light diffracted through a single narrow slit and quantitatively related the width of the slit to the angles of dispersion of the different orders of spectra. The papers begins with the claim that the advance of science depends on precision instruments, particularly in optics. He then described the phenomenon of diffraction and how it can produced by light passing through a small opening into a darkened room and the light viewed in on a distant screen. The illuminated part of the screen was larger than the opening and exhibited colored fringes at the edges. New experiments are then described, designed for measurements using a heliostat and a narrow slit that diffracted the light.  The results on the screen was examined by a theodolite, which could measure the angles involved, showing that the angle of diffraction is inversely proportional to the width of the opening. Similarly, using gratings of parallel silver or gold wires, he found that the diffraction is inversely proportional to the separation of the wires. Fraunhofer's grating had 260 wires, separated by about 0.004 Paris inch with wire thickness of about 0.002 inch. Fraunhofer made the first quantitative study of diffraction phenomena. The presence of the solar dark lines enabled him to note that the dispersion of the spectra was greater with his grating than with his prism. Hence, he examined the relationship between dispersion and the separation of wires in the grating. From the same study Fraunhofer was able to determine the wavelengths of specific colors of light.","From Theodolite to Spectral Apparatus|Jackson, M.W.|In:  <i>Instrumentation: Between Science, State, and Industry <i>, Joerges, B., Shinn, T., editors|Kluwer, 2001, 270 pp, NB: pp 17-29.||Buying the Dark Lines of the Solar Spectrum|Jackson, M.W.|In:  <i>Archimedes, Scientific Credibility and Technical Standards <i>, Buchwald, J.Z., editor|Kluwer, 1997, 178 pp, NB: pp 1-23.||Lines of Light|Brand, J.C.D.|Gordon and Breach, 1995, 266 pp, NB: pp 37-47.","Neue Modifikation des Lichtes durch gegenseitige Einwirkung und Beugung der Strahlen, und Gesetze derselben.

George Biddell Airy,"Airy, George Biddell",,1801-1892," ",On the principles and construction of the achromatic eye-pieces of telescopes,"Offprint of a detailed, practical treatise on the design and construction of achromatic telescope eyepieces
","George Biddell Airy wrote this detailed, practical treatise on the design and construction of achromatic telescope eyepieces while at Trinity College, Cambridge. Airy's treatises is the first significant advance and compilation of theory and practical techniques since Boscovich's work thirty-five years earlier. This offprint from the Transactions of the Cambidge Philosophical Society, is presented in Airy's hand to 'Dr Godfrey.'
","Airy begins his treatise with a general review of previous work and developments in achromatic lens systems. Beginning with Huygens, he traces the work of Newton, Dollond, Clairaut, D'Alembert, Euler, and finally Boscovich. As a brief historical overview is it interesting, but it is even more telling in the critical assessment Airy makes of the very theoretical--and to the practical optician, usless--work of Clairaut, D'Alembert, and Euler. The latter in particular is singled out for producing something so bristled with detail and complex mathematics as to render it unusable. On the other hand, Boscovich's work is Airy beginning point and guide. His process is to develop expressions for the visual angle of the axis of ray pencils through an eyepiece as functions of lens focal lengths that depend on the indices of refraction involved. These expressions are differentiated to determine minima that give the lens characteristics that provide the best achromatism that can be achieved. He does this for eyepieces of two, three, and four lenses. Importantly, Airy uses Joseph Fraunhofer's data that had appeared in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal two years earlier. Airy's work shows the influence of practical experience: in addition to Fraunhofer's data, Airy is concerned with lens diameter and thickness given the unlikelihood of getting large pieces of flawless glass. Airy ends the treatise with the application of his method to practical telescope eyepieces.","‚ÅÇ  <i>The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light <i>|Buchwald, J.Z|University of Chicago Press, 1989, 474 pp, NB: pp 254-259.","On the principles and construction of the achromatic eye-pieces of telescopes and on the achromatism of the microscopes|Airy, G.B.|Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Scoiety, Vol 2, Part 2, 1827, pp 227-252.",,,1825,1825-1850,"British mathematician, astronomer.

","Henry Coddington wrote this textbook on optics to upgrade the presentation of optical science and make it compatible with the mathematical skills of university students. Specifically, this meant the avoidance of discursive descriptions and elaborate geometric methods, and the adoption of concision and the methods of algebra and the calculus. In his Preface, Coddington states that his books is based on a syllabus and series of lectures delivered by William Whewell in 1819 and is a 'compilation rather than an original production' and refers to the works of Smith, Harris, Wood, Biot, and Young. Parts of Coddington's text are essentially transcripts of Whewell's lectures. Editions appeared at Cambridge in 1823 and 1825.
","Coddington's textbook deals almost exclusively with geometrical optics. Six chapters are devoted to reflection: plane surfaces, spherical surfaces, spherical aberrations, general curved surfaces, caustics, images produced by reflection. Six chapters are devoted to refraction: plane surfaces, spherical surfaces, spherical aberrations, general curved surfaces, caustics, images produced by refraction. Separate chapters are devoted to the following: chromatic dispersion, the eye and vision, optical instruments, and optical phenomena such as the rainbow, mirages, Newton's rings, and double refraction. Coddington's textbook considers off-axis aberrations and contains the first appearance of an equation for lens astigmatism. The material on physical optics is Newtonian, though Thomas Young's work on a wave theory is mentioned. Interestingly, there is no mention of Fresnel and his work on transverse waves or polarization, but an Appendix gives an English translation of Jean-Baptiste Biot's competing emission theory. The material on geometric optics is extensive, detailed and highly analytic.","‚ÅÇ  Optical designing as an art|Taylor, H.D.|<i>Transactions of the Optical Society<i>, Vol 24, No 3, 1923, pp 143-167.||Early Books in Optics & Optical Design: A Compleat System of Opticks & The Edinburgh Encyclopedia|Thompson, K.P.|<i>Optics and Photonics News<i>, Vol 16, No10,  2005, pp 28-33.","An Elementary Treatise on Optics.

","By 1825 Lewis had produced a catechisms for the following. 1: Architecture, 2: Astronomy, 3: Mechanics, 4: Natural History of Man, 5: Natural History of Beasts part 1, 6: Natural History of Beasts part 2, 7: Natural History of Ornithology part 1, 8: Natural History of Ornithology part 2, 9: Natural History of Amphibia, 10: Natural History of Ichthyology, 11: Natural History of Entomology, 12: Hydrostatics, 13: Pneumatics, 14: Hydraulics, 15: Optics, 16: Acoustics, 17: Magnetism, 18: Electricity.

John Farrar,"Farrar, John",,1779-1853," ",An Experimental Treatise on Optics,"One of John Farrar English translations of French mathematics and science texts early for use at American Universities, principally at Harvard College.","John Farrar produced English translations of several French mathematics and science texts early in the 19th century for use at American Universities, principally at Harvard College, including the texts of Legendre, Lacroix, Euler, Bezout, and Bourdon. His largest translation project was <i>A Course of Natural Philosophy in Four Parts<i>: mechanics, electricity, optics, astronomy, all drawn from Biot and each produced in a separate volume. The third, on optics, is a very close translation of Book Six of Jean-Baptiste Biot's <i>Pr√©cis √©l√©mentaire de Physique Exp√©rimentale<i> of 1817, which itself is extracted from Biot's much larger <i>TraiteÃÅ de Physique ExpeÃÅrimentale et MatheÃÅmatique<i>. Farrar's translation is an example of the considerable influence French mathematics and science had in American universities in the half-century following independence from Britain.
","Farrar's text is a direct translation of Book Six of Biot's <i>Pr√©cis √âl√©mentaire de Physique Exp√©rimentale<i>. Following some general remarks, there is a brief section on catoptrics, followed by a much longer section on dioptrics, and then the longest section on the 'Analysis of Light.' This last is a collection of sections on the nature of light, optical instruments, telescopes, microscopes, vision, and Newtonian aspects of the theory of light and color. Farrar omits Book Seven of Biot's <i>Pr√©cis √âl√©mentaire de Physique Exp√©rimentale<i>, of which 100 pages devoted solely to the polarization of light. In his preface, Farrar argues that Biot's material on polarization is too detailed and off-target for the needs he considers his book will fill. Instead, Farrar adds a brief consideration of polarization to notes at the end of the text that cover aspects of optics not covered in Biot's text. This section on polarization is taken from Coddington's text of 1825 An Elementary Treatise on Optics. The French original and its English translation is entirely descriptive, without any of the elaborate mathematical analysis that usually defined French works. What analysis is present involves only elementary geometry. It is clear that Farrar imagined student who used the book would not have much if any background in mathematics.","The Influence of French Mathematicians at the end of the Eighteenth Century upon the teaching of Mathematics in American Colleges|Simons, L.G.|<i>Isis <i>, Vol 15, No 1, 1931, pp 104-123.","An Experimental Treatise on Optics, comprehending The Leading Principles of the Science, and an Explanation of the more Important and Curious Optical Instrucments and Optical Phenomena.

","Eduard Moritz Hahn's translation of Amondiue's <i>Essai d'un Cours √âÃÅleÃÅmentaire d'Optique<i> of 1826. Hahn justifies his German translation of Amondieu's French work because of its concision, completeness, and even-handedness of treatment of the emission and wave theories of light without elaborate mathematics. He complains that many otherwise admirable German work on optics confuse verbosity with thoroughness. Through Hahn's translation, this is the first appearance of Fresnel's transverse wave theory of light in a German textbook--albeit without its elaborate mathematical underpinning. Interestingly, and perhaps confusingly, Hahn refers to the wave theory as Euler's--a reflection of the general labels 'Eulerian' and 'Newtonian' used to describe the wave and emission theories of light as they were discussed and debated in the second half of the 18th century. Johann Lambert used the same labels in his <i>Photometria<i> of 1760 to distinguish between the two theories.
","Amondieu's book is in four parts: Presentation of most known optical phenomena; The wave theory of light and its explanation of these phenomena; The particle or emission theory of light and its explanation of these phenomena; Application of optics to meteorics and instruments.

The second and third parts present, respectively, the wave and emission theories explanations of reflection, refraction, dispersion, double refraction, polarization, and the thermal and chemical effects of the solar spectrum. The wave theory is that of Fresnel and the emission theory is Newtonian. The forth part briefly describes luminous atmospheric phenomena and optical instruments, particularly the application of achromatic lenses.

In this the second edition, DeÃÅal elaborates and extends the text of the first edition. In the obsequious introduction directed to the French Academy, DeÃÅal makes clear he does not consider himself a scholar, only a compiler with, perhaps, a gift of explanation. A strange book, it is essentially an amateur's throw-back to the Cartesian-Newtonian debates of half a century earlier, with the author plumping for neither. No mention is made of the wave theory of light of the work of Fresnel, only Descartes percussive theory of light in the plenum, and Newton's theory of emission of light particles into empty space. In the end, DeÃÅal rejects the emission theory, allows that the wave theory can be admitted only in special cases. This leaves light as a luminiferous fluid emitted by sources. Editions appeared in 1823 and 1827.
","The first part is a brief history of theories of light, ending with those of Descartes and Newton. Strangely, Huygens theory is considered a modification of Decartes'. This is followed by descriptions of a series of prismatic experiments and the colors produced. Then various and well-known objections and alternatives to the Newtonian theory are presented, particularly that of Euler. In the end, the emission theory is rejected and the wave theory only in special cases. DeÃÅal concludes that light must be a luminiferous fluid emitted by sources, capable of illuminating them and bringing about vision, with propagation that is 'instantaneous and successive,' and in which color is inherent. DeÃÅal's principle and constantly cited reference is the second edition of ReneÃÅ-Just HauÃày's <i>TraiteÃÅ √âleÃÅmentaire de Physique<i> of 1806, which was little changed from the first edition of 1803.

Though the table of contents lists three parts, the printed paper contains only the first, which deals with reflection.","William Rowan Hamilton's first published paper was read before the Royal Irish Academy on April 23, 1827. In many was it was a radical revision of the first paper he presented to the academy in 1824, On Caustics. The academy declined to publish it, complaining that (among other things)  ' . . . the discussions included in the Memoir are of a nature so very abstract, and the formulae so general, as to require that the reasonings by which some of the conclusions have been obtained should be more fully developed.' Adding to the difficulty was Hamilton's habit of providing no figures to aid the reader in understanding. The printed revised paper focused the topic narrowly to the analysis of ray-systems and significantly extending the development and derivation parts. Though the table of contents lists three parts, the printed paper contains only the first, which deals with reflection. The second and third parts on simple and extraordinary refraction were never printed in Hamilton's lifetime. Hamilton's paper set out a general theory of ray analysis based what he named the system's characteristic function. With it, any optical system's performance could be assessed. It was the first and most important development in what would eventually come to be called Hamiltonian Optics. For all its theoretical power and important implications, Hamilton's theory did not see practical application until it was linked to eikonal (image) and wave equations 70 years later.||This is the Offprint from the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, Vol 15 .
","Hamilton begins with a general proof of the Theorem of Malus using the principle of least-action. It avoided the near-invincible tangle of mathematics that arose when trying to prove the theorem analytically from the laws of reflection and refraction or directly from the wave theory of light. Hamilton proved in full generality that if a system of rays is everywhere perpendicular to a surface (a real or imaginary surface or a geometric construct), the system of rays remains everywhere perpendicular to a (often different) surface after any number of reflections or refractions. From this, Hamilton derived what he named Characteristic Functions of an optical system. He gave algebraic expressions for reflection and refraction of a given system of rays involving any number of geometric surfaces. In the cases of simple surfaces of revolution this could be performed in closed form, for more complicated surfaces approximations were required. The generality of the procedure provided explicit expressions for optical aberrations.

Santini did not consider himself an inventor or originator, rather he wrote the fill the need he saw for a work that both gathered together the most important aspect of optical theory and presented it is a manner that supported practical application. Something for both the scholar and the optician. The two volumes separate the theory and development of lens design and construction, from descriptions of telescopes and microscopes. The material is entirely analytic, the practical aspects of glass cutting, grinding, figuring, and polishing are not considered. Santini's work, especially volume 1, was a significant influence on Italian opticians, particularly Giovanni Battista Amici and Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti. It was also influential with Joseph Johann Littrow at the Vienna observatory.

Volume 1: Glass properties and their measurement; single lens analysis; multiple lenses, their images, magnification, and clarity; spherical and chromatic aberrations; correcting off-optical-axis chromatic aberration; design and construction of achromatic multi-lens objective; spherical mirror. Volume II: General aspects of telescopes; Galilean telescopes; astronomical telescopes with multi-lens eye-pieces; terrestrial telescopes; micrometers and their use; catadioptric telescopes; simple and compound microscopes; instruments including the camera obscura, the lighthouse, magic lantern, phantasmagoria, diorama, and the kaleidoscope. The material in Volume I includes the use of Fraunhofer lines for measuring dispersion and the use of Euler's on-optical-axis analysis of aberrations augmented with the off-axis extensions of Kl√ºgel for general lens analysis. At all stages, the theory is applied to practical problems that are worked out in detail, particularly for the achromatic objective.

Anonymous,Anonymous,,," ",Optics,"Issues from the Library of Useful Knowledge delating with optics, double refraction, polarization, and Newtonian optics
","In 1825 Henry Peter Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux, along with Matthew Davenport Hill, founded <i>The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge<i> to create a comprehensive and inexpensive range of educational literature for the masses. To oversee and publish this literature, Brougham appointed Charles Knight. He published a number of weekly and biweekly periodicals and pamphlets and a series of biweekly, sixpenny pamphlets:  The Library of Useful Knowledge. By 1829, the time of these publications on optics, each issue of these pamphlets was selling about 6000 copies. As evidenced by these issues devoted to optics, The Library of Useful Knowledge did not engage in political or religious issues but rather focused on popularizing other areas of knowledge.||As with the present topics, some required more than one issue to cover and in that case the signatures and pagination were consecutive, so that the issue could later be be gathered together to form a complete 'chapter.' The two 'chapters' on optics, which included the present issues on optics and double refraction, were gathered together along with issues that dealt with other topics, and at the end of 1829 formed  <i>Natural Philosophy<i>, a book published by the Society. The two issues on Newton's Optics became part of the Society's <i>Natural Philosophy, Vol 2.<i>  It is know that David Brewster wrote the two issues on Optics and is very likely the author of the issues on <i>Double Refraction and Polarisation<i>, and <i>Newton's Optics<i>. The Society eventually published six volumes in its series on Natural Philosophy.","The chapter on Optics gives a general overview of optics. It contains sections on: Light and its properties; Reflection, refraction, and dispersion: Lenses and elementary geometric optics; Plane and curved mirrors: Chromatics, dispersion, and achromatic lenses; Spectra; The eye and its function; Visual perception; The Rainbow, halos, atmospheric illusions, colors in nature. The chapter on double refraction and polarization is much more details and technical. It contains sections on: Single and double refraction; Crystals and laws of double refraction; Polarization; Production of polarized light; Detection of polarized light; Crystals and polarization; Chromatic polarization; Materials and polarization, coloration, detection. The chapter on Newton's optics is a summary of by-then the standard material on prismatic color and the heterogeneity of white light.||The material is detailed, descriptive, and elementary. Very little mathematics is used, and that never rises above simple algebra and ratios.

Henry Coddington,"Coddington, Henry",,1789-1845," ",A Treatise on the Reflexion and Refraction of Light,"A textbook on optics presenting the newest theories in optics and their application. It presents modern geometrical optics as a cogent, systematic whole, in a thorough and deeply mathematical manner.
","Henry Coddington wrote this textbook on optics to present the newest theories in optics that were applicable to 'either the construction of telescopes and other optical instruments, or to the explanation of natural phaenomena.' Coddington draws heavily from earlier geometrical optics works: Barrow, Newton, Herschel, Young, the Encyclopedia Britannica, and most extensively Airy. Coddington presents modern geometrical optics as a  cogent, systematic whole. Though deeply mathematical, the book avoids digressions and inessential detail. Having drawn material from many sources, Coddington is forced to impose new but uniform notation, for which he apologizes in his preface. But his work proved so influential that his notation continues to be used. In each chapter, Coddington begins with fundamentals and builds generality and complexity in succeeding sections. The self-studying student is warned in Preface that the tyro should skip the advanced sections the first time through. This was one of the characteristics that made the book so influential. Coddingtion was not just a compiler; his generalizations, extensions, simplification, and (perhaps most importantly) the algebrization of earlier developments were a significant advance in geometrical optics. Importantly, from this book comes the eponymous 'Coddington Equations,' the 'Coddington Shape and Position Factors,' and the 'Coddington Lens.' Coddington was the first of provide a complete analysis of astigmatism and his equations are still used extensively in analysis and in ophthalmic lens design. He was also the first to formulate the 'circle of confusion' and measure of lens performance for telescopes. The books was long used as a university textbook and was influential among English-reading opticians.
","Coddington's material is in seven chapters. 1: Reflection, spherical mirrors, aberrations, equations of aberrations, foci and image equations. 2: Refraction of homogeneous light, plane surfaces, spherical surfaces, aberrations, equations of aberrations, foci and image equations, combined refractions, prisms, lenses, types of lenses, lens equations, aberrations, equations of aberrations, combined lenses. 3: Refraction combined with Reflection. 4: Images from mirrors and lenses, magnification, brightness. 5: Caustics. 6: Chromatic dispersion, measuring dispersion, approximations for dispersion, achromatic lens analysis, multiple achromatic lens systems analysis, advanced theory of the rainbow. 7: Atmospheric refraction. The material is detailed and highly analytic and most results are derived, rather than simply presented, leading to long, detailed mathematical developments. The accompanying figures are essential to following the text.","A historical perspective on understanding optical aberrations|Johnson, R.B.|In:  <i>Lens Design: A Critical Review, Proceedings <i>|SPIE, 1992, https://doi.org/10.1117/12.131966||Optical designing as an art|Taylor, H.D.|<i>Transactions of the Optical Society<i>, Vol 24, No 3, 1923, pp 143-167.","A Treatise on the Reflexion and Refraction of Light, Being Part I of a System of Optics: By Henry Coddington, M.A. F.R.S.

Widely regarded as a magisterial summary of physical optics; that is, the nature and properties of light. ","John Frederick William Herschel's article 'Light' was composed in 1827 and appeared in Volume 2 of Mixed Sciences, Second Division (Volume 4 in the entire series), of the <i>Encyclop√¶dia Metropolitana<i> in 1830. But the article itself was privately distributed beginning in 1828 and had circulated widely before its appearance in the <i>Encyclop√¶dia<i>. It was immediately recognized both in England and on the continent as a magisterial summary of physical optics; that is, the nature and properties of light. Though Herschel considered his work an 'essay', it was 243 quarto pages with additional plates and an index, and was treated as a monograph in its subsequent and immediate reprintings and translations. Pierre Frabcius Verhulst produced this French translation aided by Adolphe Quetelet. The translation was undertaken because the complete encyclopedia was expensive and of very uneven quality, and so access to important parts of it was difficult. Quetelet and Verhulst considered the extraction and translation of Herschel's essay a necessity for French science because it was 'the most complete treatise on this important part of physics.' The translation corrected the many typographical errors in the first English printing (for which it was notorious), duplicated nearly all of the mathematics, benefited from corrections provided by Herschel himself, and ended with a long supplement by Quetelet containing notes, commentary, and reprint of articles related to then-recent developments in optics. Though the translation of the full article was completed, and the first volume published in 1829, problems with the published delayed the second volume‚Äôs appearance for nearly four years. It was this interval that prompted Quetelet to write  his supplement.
","Herschel's essay is in four parts: Unpolarized Light, Chromatics, Theories of Light, Polarized Light. 1: Unpolarized Light including photometry, reflection from plane and curved surfaces, refraction at plane and curved surfaces, aberrations, images from lenses, the eye and vision. 2: Chromatics including dispersion, achromatic lenses, extinction from propagation in transparent media. 3: Theories of Light including Newtonian or corpuscular theory, general undulatory theory, interference, colors from thin and thick plates, diffraction. 4: Polarized Light including double refraction, interaction of polarized light, reflection of polarized light, refraction of polarized light, application of the undulatory theory, light in crystals, light's interaction with materials, properties of glass, colors of bodies, calorific and chemical rays in the solar spectrum. Herschel's treatments of the undulatory theory of light is a full statement of Fresnel's theory and the best presentation of the wave theory for 10 years after it appeared.","‚ÅÇ <i>The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light<i>|Buchwald, J.Z|University of Chicago Press, 1989, 474 pp, NB: pp 291-296.||The Reception of the Wave Theory of Light in Britain: A Case Study Illustrating the Role

David Brewster,"Brewster, David",,1781-1868," ",Treatise On Optics [Drawn up for the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia],"Brewster's anonymous entry on optics for Volume XV of the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia.","This is David Brewster's anonymous entry for Volume XV of the <i>Edinburgh Encyclopaedia<i> which appeared in 1830. As was common among the several competing encyclopedias of the time, articles were often not summaries of the long agreed upon aspects of a topic, but included the very latest developments. Such was certainly the case with Brewster's article on optics. Since he did not consider the question between corpuscular and wave theories settled, the physical optics part of the article is theoretical; the other aspects are much more practical and include extensive tables of optical data, much of it from Brewster's own research. This was his first attempt at a complete summary of optics and would be a template of sorts for his subsequent mathematics-expunged textbook. Though this and other of Brewster's entries in the <i>Edinburgh Encyclopaedia<i> were of high quality and had the audience afforded by readers of the Encyclopaedia, it did not obtain the wide-spread readership and influence that Peter Barlow's article 'Optics' and J.F.W. Herschel's article 'Light' did in the <i>Encyclopaedia Metropolitana<i>.||Joseph Parker published an edited American Edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia<i> at Philadelphai in 1832.
","Brewster's article begins with an extended history of optics (39 pages), from the Ancients up to Fresnel, Herschel, and Brewster's own research. Interestingly, Brewster settles a few scores with the French regarding priority for the discovery of certain optical phenomena. Part I (114 pages) covers the theory of optics including: dioptrics, catoptrics, chromatics, diffraction, thin and thick plates, double refraction and polarization. Part II (13 pages) covers the application of optics to natural phenomena including: the eye and vision, the rainbow, halos and coronas, atmospheric refraction, atmospheric and shadow colors, colors of natural bodies, photometry. Part III (35 pages) covers optical instruments and their construction including: magnifying and looking glass, anamorphosis refractors, mirrors, spectacles, camera obscura, magic lantern, microscope, microscope improvements, refracting and reflecting telescopes, achromatic objectives, analysis of achromatic and aplanatic lenses, analysis of telescope characteristics, photometers, measuring refractive index, optometer,  lens cutting, grinding, figuring, and polishing. The history material is important in part because it records in relative detail the development of the corpuscular and wave theories of light up to the time of the writing. The material on physical optics is extensive, detailed, analytic and presents both the corpuscular and wave theories with attempted even-handedness. Nevertheless, Brewster's preference for the corpuscular theory is clear. Material on geometric optics is limited to aspects of lens design. Though ostensibly for the general reader, the article is more of a research report or optics handbook, unsparing in its detailed mathematical developments and extensive tables of optical properties of materials.","<i>Encyclopaedic Visions: Scientific Dictionaries and Enlightenment Culture<i>|Yeo, R.|Cambridge Universtiy Press, 2001, 341 pp, NB: pp 270-277.","Treatise On Optics, Drawn up for the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia.

Augustin-Louis Cauchy,"Cauchy, Augustin-Louis",,1789-1857," ",Memoire sur la Theorie de la lumiere,"This memoir describes the first steps Cauchy took in the development of a theory of the luminiferous aether, extending and making more rigorous the initial conception by Fresnel.","Augustin-Louis Cauchy produced this very brief memoir to describe conditions he found necessary for the solution of the set of differential equations describing wave surfaces in birefringent materials. The near-complete success of Fresnel's theory of transverse waves and polarization brought to the fore the question as to the medium in which and the mechanism by which the wave moved. Fresnel had adopted the idea of a luminiferous aether that consisted of a 3-dimensional lattice of points or 'molecules' that interacted with by near-range forces. From this fundamentally mechanical conception of the aether and an unproved proposition regarding linear displacements, Fresnel derived expressions for his wave surfaces. Cauchy describes his reformulation of Fresnel's lattice mechanics and establishes conditions for the governing equations in conditions of birefringence. This memoir describes the first steps Cauchy took in the development of a theory of the luminiferous aether which would engage him for 20 years. This memoir was presented to the French Academy in June of 1830 which eventually appeared in the Bulletin de F√©russac. Cauchy also had it printed as a separate brochure by de Bure Fr√®res, the present edition, which was his last publication before his exile to Prague.
","Cauchy established a rigorous theory of 3-dimension lattice dynamics involving sets of linear differential equations, expressed in vector-matrix form, and used the mathematical technique of eigenvectors and eigenvalues to solve the systems of equations. The memoir does not explicitly state the eigenvector/value technique, but its use can be inferred. The conditions for the parameters of the systems of equations if they are to yield wave surfaces are stated.","‚ÅÇ Optics and the Theory of the Punctiform Ether|Buchwald, J.Z.|<i>Archive for History of Exact Sciences<i>, Vol 21, 1980, pp 245-274.","Memoire sur la Theorie de la lumiere, par M.

","Comstock makes clear in his Preface why he wrote his textbook. His consultation with experienced teachers revealed the lack of an adequate, up-to-date book on natural philosophy for use in schools. The texts on natural philosophy in use at the time were either translations of European texts or British imports, were in the form of conversations between teacher and pupil, and did not cover then-modern developments. Comstock adopted a method is strictly presentational--no derivations are provided--and the style is clear and uses simple language. Each section begins with the definition of words peculiar to the topic, followed by statements of general principles. There are often descriptions of machines, devices, or instruments that either demonstrate the principles or incorporate them. In addition, Comstock explicitly avoided the use of what he felt were overly complex diagrams, bristling with labels and letters. He chose, rather, to both simplify and increase the number of figures in the text. The simplicity of language, descriptive style, and large number of simple figures made the text popular and widely used In America for 40 years.||Editions appeared at Hartford in 1830, 1831, 1834, 1841, and at New York in 1836, 1837, 1838, 1839, 1841, 1843, 1844, 1845, 1846, 1847, 1848, 1851, 1852, 1854, 1856, 1860, 1863, 1864, 1869, and 1871.
","Comstock's text contains a Preface and nine sections: Properties of Bodies--general physics (62 pages); Mechanics (27 pages); Hydrostatics (15 pages); Hydraulics (7 pages); Pneumatics (19 pages); Acoustics (9 pages); Optics (58 pages); Astronomy (75 pages); Electricity (23 pages); and Magnetism (4 pages). The section on optics establishes light as a substance emitted by luminous objects and rays as 'a single line of light.' Rays are then used to define and give examples of refraction and reflection. Plane and spherical mirrors are described using rays and simple geometric optics, showing focusing and image formation. The operation of convex and concave lenses are described in the same manner. The function of lenses is used to explain vision and to show the cause and correction of indistinct vision. Image formation and magnification by multiple lenses is used to describe the microscope and refracting telescope. The reflecting telescope and the camera obscura is also described. The optics section ends with a description of Newton's theory of color and its use in explaining the rainbow.","<i>The Stories of Nineteenth Century American Science Textbook Writers and the Concept of Physics and Chemical Change<i>|Palmer, W.P.|ResearchGate.net: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Palmer8/publication/325472544||<i>The science of God's creation: Popular science and Christianity in the early republic<i>|Santoro, L.A.|Disseration, University of Delaware, 2011, 215 pp, NB: pp 62-76.","A System of Natural Philosophy; in which the Principles of Mechanics, Acoustics, Hydrostatics, Optics, Hydraulics, Astronomy, Pneumatics, Electricity, and Magnetism are Familiarly Explained, and Illumstrated by more than Two Hundred engravings.

It is an example of the ongoing dichotomy of romanticism's artistic color experiences and the theory built from them, and the chromatic physical optics originating with Newton.","Walter Crum produced this brief treatise color coming from a background of textile dying and pigments in 1822. Though Goethe is never mentioned, Crum presents the Aristotelian/Goethean idea that color is the result of the mixing of light and dark. Experiments are presented and their results are interpreted to support the basic idea and to attempt to soften, if not disprove, the Newtonian interpretation of prismatic colors. Crum both examined light dispersed by prism and how colors arose when view through a prism. Crum's treatise is an example of the ongoing dichotomy of romanticism's artistic color experiences and the theory built from them, and the chromatic physical optics originating with Newton. It also makes clear the difference between the industrial and commercial need to understand color and the philosopher's theories.  Crum's work is a condensation of part of the longer work by Joseph Reade, <i>Experimental Outlines for a New Theory of Colours, Light & Vision<i>, of 1816. After 1822, Crum was made aware of Reade's work, and finding the two works so similar decided not to publish. But the scant attention Reade's work attracted eventually prompted Crum to publish his own work. Crum was a significant figure in the textile dying and printing industry and his work and ideas were widely influential.
","Crum presents experiments most of which are exercises in color perception on complex fields. The results are marshaled to support his principle ideas. 1: There are three primary colors, red, blue, and yellow. 2: Color is the result of the mixing of light and dark, with colors being 'drawn out' of dark by the presence of light. 3: The prismatic colors are not immutable, as Newton claimed.","<i>Science Versus Practice: Chemistry in Victorian Britain<i>|Bud, R., Roberts, G.K.|Manchester University Press, 1984, 243 pp, NB pp 36-37, 121.||The Influence of Demand on the Emergence of the Dye Industry.

Johann Joseph von Littrow,"Littrow, Johann Joseph von",,1781-1840," ",Dioptrik,"A narrowly practical treatise on dioptrics specifically for the construction of astronomical telescopes.","Johann Joseph Littrow's wrote this narrowly practical treatise on dioptrics specifically for the construction of astronomical telescopes. He notes that other than Santini's and Prechtl's, there had been few useful works on telescope lenses since Georg Simon Kl√ºgel's of half a century earlier. But in particular, there were very few works by practicing astronomers who were also opticians, tempering theory with practice in the spirit of Johannes Kepler and Christian Huygens. Littrow was well-know on the continent and in England; both for his astronomy and his optical work, having publishing several important works in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society of London, all of which display Littrow's practical optical experience and mathematical prowess.||Littrow sets the scope of his work based on what he considers practical constraints. In this regard, he notes the futility of working on either a telescope's objective or ocular separately, attempting to perfect either with regard to aberrations. He also considers objective and ocular lens systems with three or more lenses as superfluous, citing the perfection Fraunhofer achieved with his two-lens elements. Within this scope, Littrow gathers developments since Kl√ºgel's time and add some of his own. Littrow's book was a standard telescope lens reference for decades; until the development of telescope mirrors had them surpass the performance of lenses in all aspects.
","Litttrow's text is in three parts: Theory of telescope objectives, theory of telescope oculars, and a brief history of optics. The theory of telescope objectives includes: prism and lens refraction, spherical and chromatic aberrations, four methods for designing and producing 2-lens objectives using equations from Euler, Kl√ºgel, Herschel, and himself. The theory of telescope oculars includes: ray tracing through multiple lenses, telescopes in general, telescopes with multiple lenses, simple lenses, telescopes with 2, 3, 4, and 5 lenses, accommodating the objectives and oculars, micrometers, microscopes, mirror and their images. The brief history of optics includes: the Greeks, Middle Ages, Kepler, Newton, Euler and Dollond, the 19th century. Littrow's text adopts the geometrical optical analyses of Euler, Kl√ºgel, Herschel, and his own. Most of the text is a detailed application of these to practical telescope objective and ocular design, with elaborate and complete examples. Littrow treats corrections for spherical and chromatic aberrations in only their simplest form, considering most high-order correction to be impractical.","√úber die Achromasie optischer Apparate|Kr√ºss, H.|<i>Astronomische Nachrichten<i>, Vol 90, no 16, 1877, pp 241-256.||On Barlow's New Telescope|Littrow, J.J.|<i>Memoirs of the Astronomical Society of London<i>, Vol 4, 1830, pp 481-493.","Dioptrik oder Anleitung zur Verfertigung der Fernrohre.

Airy separates the simpler assumptions, which he calls the geometrical part of the wave theory and and which he considers certain, from what he calls the mechanical part of the theory, such as Cauchy's assumption of the aether as a 3-dimentional lattice of molecules--which he considers very uncertain.
","George Biddell Airy wrote this long essay on the wave theory of light based on same certainty with which he held the theory of gravity. Of the wave theory of light Air held '... that it is certainly true, and that, by mathematical operations of general elegance, it leads to results of great interest. With regard to the evidence for this theory; if the simplicity of a hypothesis, which explains with accuracy a vast variety of phaenomena of the most complicated kind, can be considered a proof of its correctness, I believe there is no physical theory so firmly established as the theory in question.' Airy was one of the earliest British natural philosophers to accept the wave theory and he wrote extensively in its support. The current essay brought together aspects of the theory Airy considered to be its core, and presented them with his typical clear yet detailed manner. He believed that experimental data and phenomena needed to be considered along with mathematical theory; to that end Airy personally performed each experiment described in the essay. Interestingly, Airy separates the simpler assumptions  in the theory that have proven to be powerfully predictive--transverse waves, varying speeds, and such, all of which he calls the geometrical part of the wave theory--from what he calls the mechanical part of the theory--Cauchy's assumption of the aether as a 3-dimentional lattice and everything that followed from that. That later he considered probable but 'far from certain.' The essay appeared in the editions of the Mathematical Tracts of 1831, 1842, and 1858. It appeared as a separate book in 1866 and 1877. The essay did not appear in the first edition of the Mathematical Tracts of 1826.
","Airy's Essay is in several unlabeled sections. 1: General theory of undulations including the theory and mathematics of waves, wave interference, wave length, wave phase. 2: Application of wave theory to unpolarized light, including diffraction pattern positions and intensities, wave fronts, reflection, refraction, reflection and refraction both, unequal (chromatic) refraction.  3: Experiments involving optical phenomena including interference fringes, chromatic interference, prismatic interference, phase shifting with glass plates, thin plates, Newton's rings, diffraction fringes, diffraction from a rectangular aperture, colored fringes, lenses and apertures and wire gratings, diffraction spectra. 4: Double refraction including crystal properties, experiments with polarized light, relation to the hypothesis of the nature of light, transverse waves, general explanation of double refraction, conical refraction. 5: Aspects of the wave theory including predicted values of reflection from glass, total internal reflection, circularly and elliptically polarized light, reflection from metals, colored polarization, polarization in crystals with multiple axes. The material is detailed and highly analytic, with experimental optical phenomena and mathematical developments closely coupled.","The Reception of the Wave Theory of Light in Britain: A Case Study Illustrating the Role of Methodology in Scientific Debate|Canntory G.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 6, 1975, pp 109-132.","On the Undulatory Theory of Optics.

David Brewster,"Brewster, David",,1781-1868," ",Optics. Part of The Cabinet Cyclop√¶dia,"Brewster's elementary text as part of Dionysius Lardner's series <i>The Cabinet Cyclopedia<i>. He reworked much of the material in the optics article he wrote for the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, as well as his supplement to Ferguson.
","David Brewster wrote this elementary text as part of Dionysius Lardner's series <i>The Cabinet Cyclopedia<i>. Brewster had produced the long article on optics for the <i>Edinburgh Encyclopaedia<i> the previous year  and updated and augmented three editions of Ferguson's <i>Lectures on Select Subjects<i> between 1803 and 1823, so he had a practiced idea of what should be in a general exposition of optics for the lay reader. He reworked much of the material in the 1823 edition of his supplement to Ferguson. The composition is, as might be expected from Bewster's interest and commitment to the emission theory of light, heavily weighted to physical optics and the emission theory of light. It is also freighted with detailed descriptions of many of Brewster's experiments, about which Baden Powell would later comment on Brewster's text: '... and in regard to the more recondite experimental results, the student would feel rather overwhelmed with the multitude of details, than enlightened by a view of general truths.'  Editions appeared at London in 1831 and 1853, at Philadelphia in 1833 and 1841, and a German translation at Leipzig in 1836.
","Brewster's treatise is in four parts: Reflection and refraction of light; Physical optics; Natural optical phenomena; Optical instruments. 1: Reflection and refraction of light includes plain and spherical mirrors, images from mirrors, refraction in general, lenses, rays convex and concave lenses, meniscus lenses, images from lenses, magnification, spherical aberrations.  2: Physical optics includes chromatic heterogeneity, dispersion, achromatic lenses, solar spectrum, diffraction, colors from thin and thick plates, double refraction, polarized light and polarization effects of different materials. 3: Natural optical phenomena includes the rainbow, halos and coronae, parahelia, object colors, the eye and eye-function, colored shadows. 4: Optical instruments includes mirrored instruments, single and compound lenses, prisms and magnifiers, magic lantern and camera lucida, microscopes, telescopes, achromatic telescopes. The material is weighted heavily to physical optics: 60 pages are devoted to geometric optics, 200 pages to physical optics, 40 pages to natural phenomena, and 50 pages to optical instruments. Much of the physical optics section is filled with reports of the many investigations Brewster made on light interacting with crystals and other materials. The imbalance in level of detail, compared to that in the geometrical optics section is striking; chromatic aberration, for example, is barely touched upon. The whole of the material is descriptive, with only elementary geometry used. The physical optics material is entirely Newtonian, adhering to the emission theory of light; explaining, for example, interference by appeal to fits of easy reflection and transmission.","Scientific Revolutions and Scientific Rationality: The Case of the ""Elderly Holdout""|Worroll, J.|In: <i>Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Vol XIV, Scientific Theories<i>|Savage, W., editor|University of Minnesota Press, 1990, 410 pp, pp 319-354.","The Cabinet Cyclopaedia.

After the death of Joseph Fourier in 1830, Fresnel's paper was found among Fourier's. It is conjectured that Fresnel had give the work to Fourier for review, but by that time Fourier was ill and, evidently, the review never took place. Francois Aragot and Joseph Louis Guy-Lussac, editors of the <i>Annales de Chimie et de Physique<i> printed it immediately after it was rediscovered. They added a footnote: 'This memoir, which was lost, has just been found in the papers of M. Fourier.

Widely regarded as a magisterial summary of physical optics; that is, the nature and properties of light. 
","John Frederick William Herschel's article Light was composed in 1827 and appeared in Volume 2 of Mixed Sciences, Second Division (Volume 4 in the entire series), of the <i>Encyclop√¶dia Metropolitana<i> in 1830. But the article itself was  privately distributed beginning in 1828 and had circulated widely before its appearance in the Encyclopaedia. It was immediately recognized both in England and on the continent as a magisterial summary of physical optics; that is, the nature and properties of light. Though Herschel considered his work an 'essay', it was 243 quarto pages with additional plates and an index, and was treated as a monograph in its subsequent and immediate reprintings and translations. Johann Karl Eduard  Schmidt produced this very close German translation. duplicating all of Herschel's mathematics. Schmidt knew the material well and would eventually write his own textbooks in optics, as well as on astronomy, mathematics, physical geography, mechanics, and aerodynamics. Schmidt's translation was the first full presentation of Fresnel's wave theory of light in German.
","Herschel's essay is in four parts: Unpolarized Light, Chromatics, Theories of Light, Polarized Light. 1: Unpolarized Light including photometry, reflection from plane and curved surfaces, refraction at plane and curved surfaces, aberrations, images from lenses, the eye and vision. 2: Chromatics including dispersion, achromatic lenses, extinction from propagation in transparent media. 3: Theories of Light including Newtonian or corpuscular theory, general undulatory theory, interference, colors from thin and thick plates, diffraction. 4: Polarized Light including double refraction, interaction of polarized light, reflection of polarized light, refraction of polarized light, application of the undulatory theory, light in crystals, light's interaction with materials, properties of glass, colors of bodies, calorific and chemical rays in the solar spectrum. Herschel's treatments of the undulatory theory of light is a full statement of Fresnel's theory and the best presentation of the wave theory for 10 years after it appeared.","‚ÅÇ <i>The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light<i>|Buchwald, J.Z|University of Chicago Press, 1989, 474 pp, NB: pp 291-296.||The Reception of the Wave Theory of Light in Britain: A Case Study Illustrating the Role of Methodology in Scientific Debate|Canntory G.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 6, 1975, pp 109-132.","Vom Licht.

Humphrey Lloyd,"Lloyd, Humphrey",,1800-1881," ",A Treatise on Light and Vision,"A textbook on physical and geometric optics, presenting contemporary experimental results and mathematical analyses, with an emphasis on their application to the design of optical instruments.","Lloyd worked on the manuscript for his <i>Treatise on Light and Vision<i> while a junior (that is, teaching) fellow Trinity College, Dublin. It was finished early in 1831, the same year he became Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy. His Preface states he desired to assemble the experimental and mathematical developments in optics since the middle of the 18th century and present them in a form that could be used by those who design and construct optical instruments. He makes it clear that in most cases he presents results and not their derivation. Lloyd's interest is principally geometric optics, though enough physical optics is presented to give sufficient background to the theory and mathematics. He further limits the analyses he presents to that of two dimensions, particularly regarding aberration analysis. Lloyd considers this sufficient for the applications he considers.||Lloyd's text, and his demonstration in 1833 of the existence of conical refraction as predicted by Hamilton, established his reputation and was responsible, in part, for his being asked to prepare what became his 'Report on the progress and present state of physical optics' which he made to the British Association for the Advancement of Science at its meeting in Edinburgh in 1834.","Lloyd's text is in three parts. 1: On Simple or Homogeneous Light, 2: On Compound or Heterogeneous Light, 3: On Vision. Part One covers the nature of light, reflection a plane and spherical surfaces and the images produced, reflection at any curved surface, refraction at plane surfaces and prisms, refraction at spherical surfaces, aberration by spherical lenses, refraction at any curved surfaces, images formed by reflection and refraction. Part Two considers spectral optics, beginning with a consideration of the solar spectrum, dispersion by refraction at plane and spherical surfaces, and the colors of natural bodies. Part Three considers vision, restricted to a consideration of vision as aided by lenses and the subsequent development and use of the microscope and telescope of various types. An appendix considers atmospheric refraction.||The treatment is mathematical, with results clearly presented but seldom derived.

Dension Olmstead,"Olmstead, Dension",,1791-1859," ",Introduction to Natural Philosophy,A two-volume textbook on natural philosophy for use at universities. Widely used and in print for 50 years.,"Denison Olmsted wrote this two-volume textbook on natural philosophy early in his long teaching career at Yale College. In his Preface he refers to himself not as author but as 'compiler.' His stated goal is to consult the the latest and most authoritative writers in important fields of natural philosophy in order  1) to assemble a textbook that would 'make the student thoroughly familiarly acquainted with the leading principles of natural philosophy.' and 2) to 'furnish the student with as much useful information as possible.' In Olmsted's text, 'principles' and 'useful' are in italics and are the bywords for the entire work. There are very few derivations, with principles simply stated and, when appropriate, expressed mathematically with geometric, algebra, or trigonometry. Most of the text is devoted to demonstrating the principles and applying them to explain phenomena, show how machines work, describe instruments, and explain craft and technique.||The work was tremendously successful, being widely used and preprinted, with editions appearing in 1831, 1835, 1840, 1842, 1844, 1852, 1855, 1859, and 1870. An extensively revised and expanded edition appeared in 1891 and 1895.
","Olmsted's text is in six parts. Part 1 Principles of Mechanics (185 pages), covering laws of motion, gravity, projectile motion, and simple machines. Part 2 Applied Mechanics (157 pages), covering component motion, center of gravity, machinery, friction, and strength of materials. Part 3 Hydrostatics and Pneumatics (86 pages) covering fluids, fluid motion, cohesion and capillary action, fluid waves, properties of gases, air and steam, sound acoustics, and music. Part 4 Electricity (88 pages), covering general principles, electrical apparatus, Leyden jar, 'electrical light', electric battery, electrical phenomena, lightening, animal electricity. Part 5 Magnetism (35 pages), covering magnetic attraction and repulsion, 'directive' properties, the compass, magnetic navigation. Part 6 Optics (136 pages), covering nature and propagation of light, reflection, mirrors and their images, refraction, lenses and their images, Newton's chromatic heterogeneity, colors from this films, the rainbow, colors of objects, diffraction, double refraction and polarization, vision, microscopes, magic lantern, and telescopes.||For physical optics, both the wave and particle theories are presented, but both lead to the notion of the light ray, and it is used in all subsequent material. The geometric optics is elementary but thorough, accompanied by many small but clear figures.||Olmsted relies very heavily on the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana articles of Herschel, 'Light' and of Barlow, 'Optics'. He also relies on Brewster's 'Treatise on Optics'. Other sources included Newton, Huygens, Biot, Priestley, Euclid, Wood, and Ha√ºy. Interestingly, Fresnel is never used or cited.","Denison Olmsted an early American astronomer|Treadwell, T.R.|<i>Popular Astronomy<i>, Vol. 54, 1946, pp 237-241.","An Introduction to Natural Philosophy: Designed as a Text Book, for the use of the Students in Yale College.

David Brewster,"Brewster, David",,1781-1868,Edited by Alexander Dallas Bache,A Treatise on Optics,"Second American edition of David Brewster's optics text of 1831.
","Second American edition of David Brewster's text of 1831. The American editor, Alexander Dallas Bache, intended to make the text more suitable for use in a university course in optics. This meant increasing the level of detail in the geometric optics material and elaborating the material on polarization of light. Bache did this in an appendix of 90 pages. The American edition appeared in 1833, 1838, 1844, and in 1845. This is a reprinting with only minor corrections of the first American edition of 1833.
","Brache's edition corrected errors in Brewster's original text but is more significant for the 90-page, seven-chapter appendix of additional material on geometric optics and polarization. 1: Reflection by spherical mirrors. 2: Images by reflection. 3: Refraction by prisms and lenses. 4: Images by refraction. 5: Spherical aberration. 6: Double refraction and polarized light. 7: The rainbow. The added material is highly analytic, with lens design and analysis treated in extensive detail, spherical and chromatic aberration corrections described, and polarization considered from an analytic rather than a simply descriptive point of view. Interestingly, Brache's additional material is limited to analytic development and neither presents nor takes sides in the competing emission and wave theories of light.","Scientific Revolutions and Scientific Rationality: The Case of the ""Elderly Holdout""|Worroll, J.|In: <i>Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Vol XIV, Scientific Theories<i>|Savage, W., editor|University of Minnesota Press, 1990, 410 pp, pp 319-354.","A Treatise on Optics.

David Brewster,"Brewster, David",,1781-1868,"Translated by Paul Vergnaud (1818-?) French writer, translator.",Manuel d'optique,"A very close French translation of Brewster's <i>Cabinet Cyclopaedia Optics<i> of 1831
","A very close French translation of David Brewster's <i>Cabinet Cyclopaedia Optics<i> of 1831. That Brewster's optical text should be translated into French is explained by the work of Parisian publisher Nicolas-Edm√© Roret who began in 1825 to publish a 'collection of textbooks forming an encyclopedia of sciences and arts.' Much like Brewster's original, which was one of many books in Dionnysius Lardner's series <i>The Cabinet Cyclopedia<i>, Roret commissioned Paul Vergnaud to translate Brewster's English to produce an optics volume for what was known as 'La Librairie Encyclopeidique du Roret.' Vergnaud was a translator and not a natural philosopher, so the translation is accurate but slavish. Unlike Brewster's English original which at in-text figures, Roret's book gathered all the figures onto five plates.
","Brewster's treatise is in four parts: Reflect and refraction of light; Physical optics; Natural optical phenomena; Optical instruments. 1: Reflection and refraction of light includes plain and spherical mirrors, images from mirrors, refraction in general, lenses, rays convex and concave lenses, meniscus lenses, images from lenses, magnification, spherical aberrations.  2: Physical optics includes chromatic heterogeneity, dispersion, achromatic lenses, solar spectrum, diffraction, colors from thin and thick plates, double refraction, polarized light and polarization effects of different materials. 3: Natural optical phenomena includes the rainbow, halos and coronae, parahelia, object colors, the eye and eye-function, colored shadows. 4: Optical instruments includes mirrored instruments, single and compound lenses, prisms and magnifiers, magic lantern and camera lucida, microscopes, telescopes, achromatic telescopes. The material is weighted heavily to physical optics: 60 pages are devoted to geometric optics, 200 pages to physical optics, 40 pages to natural phenomena, and 50 pages to optical instruments. Much of the physical optics section is filled with reports of the many investigations Brewster made on light interacting with crystals and other materials. The imbalance in level of detail, compared to that in the geometrical optics section is striking; chromatic aberration, for example, is barely touched upon. The whole of the material is descriptive, with only elementary geometry used. The physical optics material is entirely Newtonian, adhering to the emission theory of light; explaining, for example, interference by appeal to fits of easy reflection and transmission.","Innover dans le texte.

He states that since this is the case, and no work has been done on the nature of the medium, he undertook a extensive analysis that leads him to propose ""ethereal molecules"" with shapes, forms, symmetries, structures, and propagation that explain optical phenomena. Color is inherent in these molecules, in that their ""natural and achromatic symmetry can be developed by dispersion."" This strange book is an indication of the lingering wave-particle controversy on the nature of light in Great Britain, and the wide range in the nature of those who took part in the long debate. Macvicar was certainly on the distant periphery, a dabbler--however committed--having no mathematics but mountains of curiosity and belief. In this regard, the difference between Macvicar's work to describe light's medium and the near-contemporaneous work of Augustin-Louis Cauchy could not be greater. Macvicar was an occasional correspondent with Michael Faraday, trying (unsuccessfully) to get Faraday to read his various treatises.","The first part of the book is ""Analysis"" and presents Macvicar's take on basic optical phenomena and experiments that reveal properties of light. The second part of the book is ""Synthesis"" and presents deductions from data and experiments that, it is contended, reveal the properties of ""light's molecules.""

Contains the first description of rock salt lenses and prisms, presents new vocabulary for heat radiation quantities parallel to those in optics, and established infrared spectroscopy.
","The first two in a long series of articles by Melloni on heat radiation and the thermal properties of materials. In the first article he described and used his sensitive thermopile and galvanometer to survey the infrared transmittance of a variety of materials. The instrument in its early form had been developed by Leopoldo Nobili but had been improved by Melloni sufficiently to detect very weak heat radiation. The instrument was called a 'thermomultiplicateur', was approximately 50 times more sensitive than any extant liquid and glass thermometer, and with the appearance of this paper, it and Melloni's work became widely known. Melloni presented this work to the French Academy of Sciences in February 1833.||The second paper reports more extensive experiments and the particularly important discovery that rock salt was as transparent to heat radiation as glass was to optical radiation. Melloni would make prisms and lenses of rock salt to discover the infrared parallel to geometric optics. Melloni's work would eventually show the unity of optical and heat radiation and lead to the unification of heat, optical, and chemical radition into a single spectrum. An English translations of the first paper appeared in the American Journal of Science, Vol 1, No 2, 1835, both papers appeared in German translations in the Annalen der Physik und Chemie, Ser 35, 1835.","Melloni's account of his survey of the infrared transparency of many materials. He reports using four heat sources: a so-called Locatelli lamp, an incandescent platinum spiral, and sheet copper at low and high temperature. He measured the relative infrared transmittance thin sheets of 36 materials. He reported that the heat radiation from the four heat sources differed in intensity and 'quality'--that is, what would now be called spectral power distribution. He also showed that heat transmittance was a property of the material alone. The experiments are described with detail and clarity sufficient to allow them to be repeated.  He showed that rock salt was highly transparent to heat radiation and built lenses and prisms from it to investigate the refraction, focusing, and dispersion of heat radiation. The second paper describes the eponymous Melloni Optical Bench which he developed to facilitate his experimental work. Melloni demonstrated broad parallels between visible and heat radiation, and to facilitate descriptions he proposed new vocabulary. Among these were: 'thermochrose', 'diathermy', and 'athermancy' as radiant heat parallels to the optical properties of color, transparency, and opacity.","The Infrared Pioneers--II.

Baden Powell,"Powell, Baden",,1796-1860," ",A Short Elementary Treatise on Experimental and Mathematical Optics,"A text on geometric optics written specifically for university students in general, and Oxford students in particular.  It presents optics with the aid of the concision afforded by algebraic and trigonometric analysis, avoiding elaborate geometry.","Baden Powell wrote this text specifically for university students in general, and Oxford students in particular. Powell finds many then-available books 'too large and too difficult on the one hand, or incomplete and obscure on the other.' He cites texts by James Wood of 1799, Henry Coddington of 1829, Humphrey Lloyd of 1831, David Brewster of 1831, and Herschel's article in the <i>Encyclopaedia Metropolitana<i>. Though all are valuable, Powell find some too deeply based on geometry and so lack the concision of algebraic and trigonometric analysis, some too elaborate and detailed for a single university course. Powell's stated intension is to present optics with the aid of the concision afforded by algebraic and trigonometric analysis, and to avoid the usual distinction made between geometrical and physical optics. In this regard, Though Powell was committed to the wave theory of light, he insisted it was possible to present and describe all optical phenomena without recourse to a physical theory of light. Pointedly, the text is 'limited entirely to the experimental and mathematical part of optics, without entering in the small degree upon physical optics, properly so called.' For physical theories of light, Powell refers the student to Herschel's article Light of 1830 or Airy's Mathematical Tracts of 1831. Powell's text is interesting and was influential for its assiduous avoidance of physical hypotheses about light and its adherence to experimental fact and mathematical analysis.
","Baden Powell's textbook covers the following. Light and its propagation; Reflection and refraction in general; Reflection and refraction at plane and curved surfaces; The mathematical theory of the Pencil of Rays; Application of pencil theory to lenses; On and off optical axis analysis; Spherical aberrations; Analysis of lens performance and image production; Optical instruments; The eye and eye-function; Chromatic dispersion; Chromatic aberration; Achromatic lenses; The rainbow and  halos; Double refraction; Interference; Colors in thin and thick plates; Polarization of light; Color and interference in polarized light; Types of polarization.

","Joseph Louis Adrien Amondieu wrote this text expressly to present the then-recent work of Fresnel and the transverse wave theory of light. This optics work is taken from a basic general course in physics Amondieu was teaching at the time, but he judged developments in optics important enough to warrant a separate text. Written for beginning students, Amondieu assumes they have mastery of only trigonometry and geometry, and so decided to 'remove the very complicated calculus, and give only the results of the analysis; however, I have allowed some simple geometrical demonstrations to remain, which, far from obscuring the matter, can only clarify it, and which will be easily understood by the students.' Amondieu's is the earliest textbook to present Fresnel's theory of light--albeit without its elaborate mathematical underpinnings. Importantly, it is the first book to present a judicial-scientific evaluation of light theories: it sets out the principal phenomena of optics, and then presents how the two theories explain or model each phenomena. The text appeared in 1826 with a reissue of that printing in 1834; only the date on the title page has been changed.||Amondieu optics text first appeared in 1826 and was reissued in 1834 with the same title page, only the date being changed. A German translation appeared at Leipzig in 1827.
","Amondieu's book is in four parts: Presentation of most known optical phenomena; The wave theory of light and its explanation of these phenomena; The particle or emission theory of light and its explanation of these phenomena; Application of optics to meteorics and instruments. The first part describes: direct light, catoptrics, dioptrics, lenses, the eye and eye-function, chromatic dispersion, double refraction, polarization, diffraction, the thermal and chemical effects of the solar spectrum. The second and third parts present, respectively, the wave and emission theories explanations of reflection, refraction, dispersion, double refraction, polarization, and the thermal and chemical effects of the solar spectrum. The wave theory is that of Fresnel and the emission theory is Newtonian. The forth part briefly describes luminous atmospheric phenomena and optical instruments, particularly the application of achromatic lenses.","Joseph Louis Adrien Amondieu (1795-1849) Professeur de physique|In: Le Lyc√©e Clemenceau: 200 Ans d'Histoire, 2008.","Essai d'un cours eÃÅleÃÅmentaire d'optique, contenant les deux theÃÅories de la lumieÃÄre dans les systeÃÄmes des ondulations et de l'eÃÅmission.

The book provides a view of the last vestiges of support for the emission theory of light in Britain.","Thomas Exley <i>Physical Optics<i> follows upon and is a companion to his earlier book on gravitation, <i>A New Theory of Physics<i> of 1829. Exley's theory of attractive (gravitational) and repulsive forces is used to explain known optical phenomena. Though never mentioned (or perhaps even known to Exley), the idea is an echo of that of Boscovich of nearly a century earlier. Exley never acknowledges the wave theory of light, Fresnel‚Äôs' stunning quantitative success at explaining diffraction and polarization, or how his mechanical/ballistic theory was superior. A strange book, seemingly without influence, that provides a view of the last vestiges of support for the emission theory of light in Britain. Exley's <i>New Theory of Physics<i> and <i>Physical Optics<i> were reviewed in 'The Eclectic Review' for 1837: an extended summary coupled with a tepid and guarded reaction based on the lack of mathematics and experimental proof.
","Exley's text is in 17 sections, the first two giving Exley's general optical-gravitational theory and all the rest covering a different optical phenomenon and how it is explained by the theory. 1: Definitions and general notions. 2: Deductions from physics. 3: Reflection and refraction. 4: Chromatic dispersion. 5: Absorption. 6: Thin plate colors. 7: Thick plate colors. 8: Diffraction. 9: Polarization. 10: Polarization by reflection. 11: Polarization by transmission. 12: Double refraction. 13: This plates from crystals. 14: Colors from crystals. 15: Circular polarization. 16: Absorption of polarized light. 17: The eye and eye function, colors of objects. Exley proposes that in addition to Newton's inverse-square-of-distance gravitational attraction, there is a related repulsive force that acts only over very small distances. The interaction of large 'atoms' of ordinary matter with the vanishingly small particles of the luminiferous aether are governed by these two forces. The material is entirely descriptive, with only elementary geometry occasionally used. In each section, the general theory is invoked to explain, in a qualitative manner only, the phenomena under consideration. No computations or analysis is given.","<i>Optics After Newton: Theories of Light in Britain and Ireland, 1704-1840<i>|Cantor, G.N.|Manchester University Press, 1983, 265 pp, NB: pp 70-72.","Physical Optics.

Among these were: 'thermochrose', 'diathermy', and 'athermancy' as radiant heat parallels to the optical properties of color, transparency, and opacity.","The Infrared Pioneers--II.

Goldschmidt extracted the basic and complete parts of Schmidt's text, noting that Schmidt's manuscript hardly considered the topics of diffraction, interference, double refraction, and polarization. Those were not part of the edited text. What remained was material on geometrical optics and, unknown for optics books of that time, extensive material on lighting and visual perception. The subjects left untreated in the printed text resulted only from the lack of Schmidt's written material on these subjects. As a student of Gauss, Schmidt was eminently capable of the mathematics required to follow the then-modern development in the wave theory of light, and it is known that Schmidt had carefully studied and reviewed Cauchy's works in optics.

Cauchy's results were generally considered a success, as his equations yielded predictions of dispersion that matched well the measurements Fraunhofer had made for several types of glass. From this work came the eponymous 'Cauchy's Dispersion Formula.'

Humphrey Lloyd,"Lloyd, Humphrey",,1800-1881," ",Report on the Progress and Present State of Physical Optics,"An extensive report on physical optics presented at the fourth meeting the British Association for the Advancement of Science. It marked the final triumph in Britain of the wave theory of light over the emission theory.","Humphrey Lloyd prepared an extensive report on the state of physical optics which he presented at the fourth meeting the British Association for the Advancement of Science, held in Edinburgh in 1834. He had been invited to deliver the report after the notoriety of his experimental optics work. A year later the full proceedings of the meeting were published, including Lloyd‚Äôs 120-page report. Lloyd reviews optical phenomena and evaluates the ability of the wave and emission theories to account for them, with the wave theory, according to Lloyd, showing it full power and superiority to the emission theory. It marked the final triumph in Britain of the wave theory of light over the emission theory. By the time of Lloyd‚Äôs report, George Biddell Airy, John Herschel, William Whewell, William Rowan Hamilton, and Baden Powell had all embraced the wave theory. Among other successes attributed to the wave theory, Lloyd reports on Hamilton's prediction of 'conical refraction' in biaxial crystals and his own remarkable experimental verification of this phenomena. The report also signaled another change: the adoption of mathematics, at whatever complexity and depth was required, to support physics. That is, the emergence of mathematical physics.
","Lloyd's states the purpose of his report: 'consider in some detail the present state of our knowledge with regard to the physical theory of light, and the successive advances which have, in late years, been made toward its establishment.' Lloyd's plan is to consider important optical phenomena and evaluate how far they are commensurate with the wave and emission theories. The phenomena considered are in two groups: 1) Propagation and interference, reflection and refraction, diffraction, thin and thick plate colors, and 2) polarization and transverse waves, reflection and refraction of polarized light, double refraction, crystal plate colors. The report considers each in turn, giving the principle experimental data and evaluating the development of the emission and wave theories to explain them. The development includes more-or-less recent history of the work performed on both theories, with extensive citation of the relevant references. For the modern emission theory Biot is cited extensively, for the wave theory Young, Fresnel, Arago, and Cauchy are. Unlike Herschel's article 'Light' that had appeared in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana in 1830, Lloyd's report contains virtually no mathematics. The development and state of the two theories is given in purely descriptive form, in many ways making the case for the wave theory more compelling, certainly more approachable. The report is, in its essence, a vast review of the literature on physical optics.","Waves, Philosophers and Historians|Buchwald, J.Z.|In: <i>Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association<i>, 1992.

Aside from a very cursory consideration of the nature of light (Descartes' hypothesis is mentioned!) the text deals entirely with geometrical optics. Fresnel's work, for example, is not mentioned.  For some of the material on telescope lens systems, Coddington's textbook of 1829 is referenced and quoted. The treatment is elementary and the analysis is a mix of elementary geometry and algebra.

He made drawings from his observations of the patterns, some reproduced in hand-colored plates in the book.
","Friedrich Magnus Schwerd began work on this treatise in 1833 in the spare time from his teaching duties. Schwerd calculated and observed the angular and chromatic dispersion displayed by Fraunhofer diffraction; that is, the pattern produced by diffraction of a small aperture observed at a distance very large compared to the aperture size and the wavelength of the light involved. Fraunhofer's work with diffraction gratings allowed him to formulate relationships between wavelength, aperture size, and diffracted angle. Schwerd was the first to make elaborate calculations using these relationships to determine the amplitude and distribution in Fraunhofer diffraction patterns for many single apertures of various shapes, and arrays of apertures. Schwerd made drawings from his observations of the patterns, some reproduced in hand-colored plates in the book. He also made experimental observations using equipment of his own design and manufacture to verify his calculations. The agreement between Schwerd's calculations and observations was seen as another, independent verification of the wave theory of light. His work would later be copied by Am√©dee Guillemin in his Les Ph√©nomenes de la Physique of 1868 and the data in Schwerd's book became standard, being used in physics and optics texts until the third decade of the 20th century.
","Schwerd calculated the Fraunhofer diffraction patterns produced by apertures with various geometric openings, including squares, rectangles, slits, circles, and combinations of these. The calculations produced the relative amplitude and positions of the patterns' forms and fringes. The calculations, done by summation approximations to the integrals involved, were comprehensive and reported in detail. Most interesting and influential was Schwerd's solution for a circular opening, the results for which was long quoted in optics texts, which he reports having obtained by approximating the circular opening with 180 trapezoids. The accuracy of Schwerd's calculations and drawings have been demonstrated by modern photographic and computational analysis.","Die Beugungserscheinungen: a Tribute to F. M.

","Fresnel began the memoire delineating reasons why a ray or corpuscular theory of light cannot be correct, the essential problem being that rays and corpuscles are independent and only mechanical interactions can be used to explain optical phenomena. The rest of the memoire is essentially a series of lectures, giving background and detail appropriate for readers not familiar with wave analysis. The topics, in turn, are: all 'rays' are involved in diffraction, not just those near the diffractor; Huygens' Principle permits the necessary interactions to be modelled; a diffractor blocks part of an otherwise full wavefront and the resulting sub-wavefronts generate interference fringes; positions of fringe maxima can be predicted only by incorporating (integrating) the phase interactions along the wavefront that is not blocked by the diffractor; derivation of the integrals that express the necessary phase interactions; comparison of predictions of position of fringe maxima with experimental measurement. Fresnel's analyses included fringes produced by a half-infinite diffractor, a narrow slit, and a narrow diffractor.

","Lloyd's states the purpose of his report: 'consider in some detail the present state of our knowledge with regard to the physical theory of light, and the successive advances which have, in late years, been made toward its establishment.' Lloyd's plan is to consider important optical phenomena and evaluate how far they are commensurate with the wave and emission theories. The phenomena considered are in two groups: 1) Propagation and interference, reflection and refraction, diffraction, thin and thick plate colors, and 2) polarization and transverse waves, reflection and refraction of polarized light, double refraction, crystal plate colors. The report considers each in turn, giving the principle experimental data and evaluating the development of the emission and wave theories to explain them. The development includes more-or-less recent history of the work performed on both theories, with extensive citation of the relevant references. For the modern emission theory Biot is cited extensively, for the wave theory Young, Fresnel, Arago, and Cauchy are. Unlike Herschel's article 'Light' that had appeared in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana in 1830, Lloyd's report contains virtually no mathematics. The development and state of the two theories is given in purely descriptive form, in many ways making the case for the wave theory more compelling, certainly more approachable. The report is, in its essence, a vast review of the literature on physical optics.","Waves, Philosophers and Historians|Buchwald, J.Z.|In: <i>Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association, 1992<i>.

William Rowan Hamilton,"Hamilton, William Rowan",,1805-1865," ",Theory of Systems of Rays - Third Supplement,"Hamilton's last contribution to his analytic techniques encompassed by his 'Theory of Systems of Rays,' first presented in 1828. Famously, in this paper he predicts conical refraction which was observed by Humphrey Lloyd.
","William Rowan Hamilton's first published paper was read before the Royal Irish Academy on April 23, 1827. The printed revised paper focused the topic narrowly to the analysis of ray-systems and significantly extending the development and derivation parts. Though the table of contents lists three parts, the printed paper contains only the first, which deals with reflection. The second and third parts on simple and extraordinary refraction were never printed in Hamilton's lifetime. But he wrote three supplements, read before the Royal Irish Academy at sessions in 1830, 1831, and 1832. All three were eventually published, the Third Supplement printed in volume 17  of the transactions of the academy in 1837; the present work.||By the time Hamilton was working on these supplements, Fresnel's optics was finding a wide audience in Great Britain, part of its new enthusiasm for French mathematical physics. In this third supplement, Hamilton reports that Fresnel's theory implies the existence of 'conical refraction.' He asked his friend Humphrey Lloyd to look for it and, famously, Lloyd showed the existence of the peculiar phenomena. This demonstration was a strong confirmation of Fresnel's theory. Lloyd's paper describing his detection of conical refraction was printed immediately following Hamilton's. From correspondence between Hamilton and Lloyd at the time, it is clear that Lloyd had a complete understanding of Hamilton's work and was a significant contributor to the final form of Hamilton's work.","Hamilton takes up Fresnel's theory of propagation of light in crystals; specifically Fresnel's wave surface, its orientation with respect to the optical axes of the crystal, the two sheets that comprise it, and the significance of their shape and intersections. Hamilton establishes his own algebraic form for these surface sheets and showed that at their intersections form conical cusps and at these points, the crystal should exhibit conical refraction. That is, a single incident ray will be refracted into a cone of rays. A remarkable prediction verified by the experimental work of Humphrey Lloyd.

This work was central in the eventual unification of light and heat as a single radiant phenomena.

This second memoire was prompted, in part, by exchanges that had taken place in British scientific journals regarding work by J.D. Forbes of the University of Edinburgh that supported the existence of radiant heat polarization. 
","In this memoire, Melloni uses laminae of mica to produce and detect radiant heat polarized by refraction and conducts experiments to determine how it behaves upon reflection. Importantly, Melloni shows that maximum radiant heat polarization takes place at the angle of incidence predicted by Brewster in the luminous case, using the index of refraction for radiant heat for mica. Melloni also detects birefingent polarization of radiant heat. In all cases, Melloni shows that it is necessary to shield or remove the heat radiated by the warmed laminae, otherwise it is mixed with the transmitted polarized radiation and confounds measurements. In doing so, he demonstrates some of the problems with J.D. Forbes' experiments.","The Infrared Pioneers--II.

These predictions are compared to experimental observations. The thesis shows the rapid impact of Fresnel's work on European optics in general and French university teaching in particular. This is the doctoral thesis of the physicist Jean-Joseph-Benoit Abria who, upon graduating from the √âcole Normale in Paris, joined the faculty of sciences at Bordeaux where he taught for 50 years, being Dean of Physics Faculty for 40 years. Abria would work in optics most his life, followed Melloni's work on radiant heat carefully, and in 1866 published <i>Sur l'identit√© de la chaleur et de la lumi√®re<i>; the final unification of light and heat into a single radiant phenomenon.
","The thesis begins with an historical review of diffraction, beginning with Grimaldi's initial observations and culminating in Fresnel's theory and his eponymous integrals for performing calculation to predict diffraction fringes.  Fresnel's  mathematics is applied to circular diffraction fringes, predicting their position. The author reports experiments in which he determined the placement and color of the fringes and compares them with what Newton reported in his work on thin film fringes. The position of the observed fringes are in alignment with the calculations, and the colors observed are used to estimate the wavelength of the light involved.","<i>The Savant and the State: Science and Cultural Politics in Nineteenth France<i>|Fox, R.|Johns Hopkins Unversity Press, 2012, 393 pp, NB: pp 100-102.","These de Physique sur la Diffraction de la Lumiere presentee a la faculte des sciences de Paris par J.-B.

The style and manner of presentation make it clear the text was written by an experienced teacher. It is also clear that the book was written to accompany a course or tutoring in optics--there is no forward or preface and nothing to aid the self-taught. The scope of the text is limited to geometrical optics and its application to optical instruments and is highly analytic, providing clear mathematical derivations of important results regarding lenses, images, and the characteristics of optical instruments. This is among the first optics textbooks to use pencils of rays throughout, rather than the simpler geometrical artifice of single rays. Griffin's optics textbook became a standard work and was in use for many years. Editions appeared in 1838 and 1842. Griffin's text was extensively revised and amended by Stephen Parkinson and appeared in 1859, 1870, and 1884.
","Griffin's textbook has 189 articles in seven sections. 1: General properties of light, reflection and refraction, rays and pencils of rays, reflection and refraction at spherical surfaces, geometrical focus, spherical aberration, reflection and refraction at parabolas and hyperbolas. 2: Off-optical-axis of reflection and refraction of pencils. 3: Combined reflection and refraction, paths through multiple media, paths through prisms and lenses, foci. 4: Off-optical-axis pencils and image formation in lenses. 5: Dispersion, varying indices of refraction and Fraunhofer lines, chromatic aberration, achromatic lenses, on and off-axis analysis. 6: Vision and optical instruments, eye and eye-function, telescopes, field of view, magnification, lensed and mirrored telescopes, eye-pieces, simple and compound microscopes, 7: The rainbow, formation, primary and secondary bow.  Appendix: Examples. The material is detailed and analytic. The development of lens analysis is very detailed, particularly the off-optical-axis analysis and aberrations which was unusual for textbooks. Applications of analysis to telescopes and microscopes is concise in the extreme. More elaborate is the explanation and solution of problems in geometrical optics posed in the 20-page Appendix.","<i>A History of the Study of Mathematics at Cambridge<i>|Ball, W. W.

Friedrich Wilhelm Barfuss,"Barfuss, Friedrich Wilhelm",,1809-?," ","Optik, Catoptrik und Dioptrik","A compendium of practical instrumental optics to explain the nature, construction, and use of such instruments, particularly of the telescope and microscope.","Friedrich Wilhelm Barfuss produced this compendium of practical instrumental optics to explain the nature, construction, and use of such instruments, particularly of the telescope and microscope. Barfuss' approach is entirely practical; that is, based solely on the use of optics to clarify and extend vision. This, his preface explains, is the justification for the long initial section on sight, perspective, shadow, anamorphosis, and appearances. Reflection and refraction are introduced in their simplest form, and then exemplified by consideration of the operation of a large number of experimental arrangements and instruments. In an attempt to reach a large audience, Barfuss holds it to be a mistake to introduce mathematical abstractions early in optical study; being appropriate only after a more graphical or geometric understanding is achieved and then mathematics can be invoked to consider advanced ideas and detail. For the more advanced material, Barfuss cites then-recent works on optics and instruments. Intending to provide a complete guide to instruments, he includes material on all aspects of glass working and instrument construction. Editions appeared in 1839, posthumously in 1860, and much revised in 1889. Barfuss published his <i>Theorie der Spiegelmikroscope mit Sph√§rischen Glasspiegeln<i> in 1840 as an addendum to the present work. 
","Barfuss' compendium is in nine chapters. 1: Vision and sight, perception, projection, camera obscura. 2: Perspective, appearance, shadows. 3: Laws of reflection, mirrors, analysis of plane and curved mirrors, images from mirrors, description of mirrored instrument operation, mirror anamorphosis. 4: Laws of refraction, refraction and plane and curved surfaces, operation of prisms, prismatic colors, index of refraction and dispersion, measurement, description of refractive instrument operation. 5: Lenses, types of lenses, analysis of lenses, calculating focal lengths and image position and size, spherical aberration, chromatic aberration. 6: Simple lensed instruments, camera lucida, camera obscura, magic lantern, the eye and eye-function, spectacles for vision correction. 7: Lensed telescopes, general form, types, magnification, achromatic objectives, discussion of recent practical lens work, example telescopes, telescope configuration and use. 8: Mirrored telescopes, Newtonian telescope, Gregory's telescope, example telescopes. 8: Microscopes, simple and compound, field of view and magnification, objective and ocular combinations, chromatic and spherical aberration correction, illumination methods, mirrored microscopes, solar microscope. 9: Instrument making, optical glass, glass properties, lens grinding, figuring and polishing, machine and hand work, mirror making. Most sections begin with a general description, invoking only simple geometry, followed in some cases by formulae and worked examples using real data. Virtually all the material is geometrical optics; phenomena important for instruments are described without any attempt to invoke physical optics for explanation. Analytical results, such as lens specifications, from other works are presented without derivation.","<i>Carl Zeiss: A Biography 1816‚Äì1888<i>|Wimmer, W., Paetrow, S.|Zeiss Archives, 2016, 144 pp, NB: pp 61-62.","Optik, Catoptrik und Dioptrik oder theoretisch-praktischer Unterricht uÃàber den moÃàglichst vollkommenen Bau aller optischen Instrumente, besonders aller Arten von FernroÃàhren und Microscopen, nebst Angabe der praktischen Hilfsmittel zur technsichen AusfuÃàhrung derselben.

"William H.C. Bartlett, H.C.","Bartlett, William H.C.",,1804-1893," ",An Elementary Treatise on Optics,"An elementary optics textbook written for and tailored to cadets at the United States Military Academy. ","William H.C. Bartlett states very clearly his purpose in writing this textbook: to produce an elementary optics textbook suitable for and tailored to cadets at the United States Military Academy. He is also clear that the book draws its material from the books of Coddington, Brewster, Herschel, and Powell, all of whom had recently produced either books or extended articles on optics. The geometric optics material comes from the textbooks of Coddington, Brewster, and Powell; the physical optics material comes from Herschel's article 'Light' in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana of 1830. Though the substance of the material comes from these sources, the textbook is no mere compendium. Bartlett was a mathematician and astronomer and incorporated material he well understood, making the style and manner of its presentation his own: principle results are derived (rather than just stated), with geometry, algebra, and the calculus used as required. It is clear that Bartlett made (quite knowingly) the assumption that the cadets would have sufficient mathematical sophistication by the time that took the optics course based on this book. He held that textbooks has three purposes: exercise of mental discipline, generation of subject knowledge, and confirmation of mathematical power. But Bartlett's textbook is not all theory; there are extensive sections describing applications of theory to optical instruments, their construction, and their use. This general form and style was characteristic of the other textbooks he produced: Acoustics, Astronomy, Mechanics, and Molecular Physics. Editions of the optics textbook appeared in 1839 and much revised in 1893.
","Bartlett's textbook as essentially two parts: geometric optics and optical instruments (175 pages), and physical optics (50 pages), though there are no separately labeled sections. The material is presented in a single, continuous stream. The material on geometrical optics begins with fundamental laws of reflection and refraction, interaction of both with plane and spherical surfaces, development of the pencil of rays as the basic geometric optics entity, lenses and their characteristics, spherical aberrations. These developments are then applied to image generation, the eye and eye-function, field of view and magnification, the description of several types of telescopes, surveying instruments, camerae lucida and obscura, the magic lantern, atmospheric optical phenomena. The physical optics material is entirely wave theory based and covers interference, diffraction, double refraction, polarization, and colors of thin plates. The geometrical optics material is detailed, highly analytic, and applied to characterizing optical instruments whenever possible. The physical optics material is more general and descriptive.","<i>Biographical memior of William H.C.

He cites the recent work in what is now called infrared radiation which showed that it too could be part of a general wave theory of radiation. But he considered available textbooks to be wholly insufficient and too elementary in their presentation of the modern wave theory, too timid in their willingness to use the necessary mathematics, and the availability of original sources too difficult to provide the necessary means of study. He wrote what considered to be the necessary supplement for physics textbooks. The result was an advanced, highly mathematical treatment of the wave theory of light, constructed using the basic developments of Fresnel on transverse waves and polarization and the work of Cauchy on the 3-dimentional lattice nature and properties of the luminiferous aether. Knochenhauer developed several new methods for approximating the elaborate integrals that expressed the consequences of the theory in the form of quantities that could be measured. His work was on the same level as that of George Biddell Airy. Knochenhauer's book became a standard references and was cited until the turn of the 20th century.  His work in wave theory lead to his work in electric field theory and his proposal in 1842 of electric oscillations.
","Knochenhauer's treatise contains 17 sections. 1: Equations that determine the vibrations of light in a uniformly elastic medium. 2: Movement of light. 3: Diffraction of light. 4: Refraction and dispersion. 5: Oscillation Equations of the Reflected and refracted light, Circular and elliptic polarization. 6: Interference phenomena by reflection. 7: Reflection from metal surfaces. 8: Colors from Thin Plates. 9: Mathematical required for the equations for light oscillations one and two-axis media. 10: The vibrational equations of light in one and two-axis media. 11: Double Refraction. 12: Direction of polarization of the ordinary and extraordinary refracted rays. 13: Color decomposition in unequal elastic media. 14: Influence of surfaces of uniaxial crystals on reflected and refracted light. 15: Influence of Surfaces of Two-Crystals on reflected and refracted Light. 16: Interference of ordinary and extraordinary refracted rays after their passage through plates of one or two-axes crystals. 17: Rings of color around the axis of the quartz crystal.

F. W. Gustav Radicke,"Radicke, F. W. Gustav",,1810-1883," ",Handbuch der Optik,"A compendium providing a detailed, mathematical description of the wave theory of light.","F. W. Gustav Radicke produced this two-volume compendium to provide a detailed, mathematical description of the wave theory of light. He makes clear that since the time of Malus' discovery of polarization by reflection, the development of wave theory had been extensive and rapid, but the original works were hard to acquire, other books were insufficiently detailed, and the most rest developments had seen little recognition. Radicke's approach was entirely theoretical, coming to his subject as a mathematician with the task of accommodating the wave theory of light to experimental facts of optical phenomena. Radicke attempts to accommodate virtually all optical phenomena, and his list includes those described in the stream of journal articles produced by the unwearying David Brewster. One of nine parts of the two volume work deals with practical matters: optical instruments, with descriptions of applications of theory to image formation that are, as is the rest of the work, of dense and deep concision.
","Radicke's two volumes encompass nine parts. 1: Laws of motion of homogeneous light. 2: Light propagation at media transitions. 3: Interference phenomena. 4: Interference phenomena due to unequal paths. 5: Reflection and Refraction. 6: Absorption. 7: Physiological optics. 8: Meteorological optics. 9: Optical instruments. The first two parts present a full development of the wave theory of light. Most of Parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 are devoted to applications of the theory to account for a long list of laboratory experimental results that reveal a particular optical phenomena. Parts 7, 8, and 9 apply wave theory to natural phenomena. The material is detailed and highly analytic.","Radicke, F. W.

Carl Friedrich Gauss,"Gauss, Carl Friedrich",,1777-1855," ",Dioptrische Untersuchungen,"Gauss considers the paths of light rays through a system of lenses and produces his most remarkable result: the reduction of complex optical system to the analysis of a single, infinitely thin lens. This was the foundation of what has become Gaussian Optics
","Carl Friedrich Gauss first became involved in optics in 1807 when a Hamburg instrument maker asked him about an achromatic telescope objective. Gauss's work in optics was always a mix of the theoretical and elaborately computational, particularly in optics. His work ended up be limited because of his resolute believe in the corpuscular nature of light. In this short but famous work, Gauss considers the paths of light rays through a system of thick lenses. His most remarkable result is the reduction of complex optical system to the analysis of a single, infinitely thin lens. This was the foundation of what has become Gaussian Optics
","Gauss demonstrates that, if only paraxial rays are considered, a rotationally symmetric lens system of any degree of complexity can be analyzed by replacing it by two principal points and two focal points of an otherwise infinitely thin lens. Along with the nodal points, these are now called the cardinal points of the lens system. Gauss gives a process to determine the positions of these points experimentally, and an iterative method to determine their positions from surface curvatures. In the process of developing this iterative process, Gauss set down the two governing simultaneous linear equations that relate input and output ray position and angle. This would eventually lead to matrix methods in Gaussian Optics. The distances from the principal points to their respective focal points being the focal lengths of the lens. The paraxial assumption and the analysis shown to be possible in the present work has come to be know as Gaussian Optics and is still used today.","<i>Lens Design Fundamentals<i>|Kingslake, R., Johnson, R.B.|Academic Press, 2010, 549 pp, NB: pp 67-68.||Correctly making panoramic imagery and the meaning of optical center|Johnson R.B.|In: <i>SPIE Proceedings, Optical Engineering + Applications, 2008<i>.||Numerical Work.

Humphrey Lloyd,"Lloyd, Humphrey",,1800-1881," ",Lectures on the Wave-Theory of Light,A mid-19th century summary of the wave theory of light; after the theories of Young and Fresnel and before the electromagnetism of Maxwell.,"Lloyd had worked on the manuscript for his <i>Treatise on Light and Vision<i> while a junior (that is, teaching) fellow Trinity College, Dublin. It was finished early in 1831. He had followed the developments of wave-based physical optics carefully and in 1834 produced his famed report on the state of physical optics for the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in that year. This included his description of the verification of conical refraction, predicted by Hamilton using Fresnel's theory. All of this work was summarized in these lectures on physical optics dealing with the wave theory of light. At the time of their publication, the wave theory of light had completely overtaken the emission and ray theories in England. Editions of Lloyd's lectures appeared in 1841 (the edition described here), in 1857 at London with the slightly changed title ""Elementary Treatise on the Wave-Theory of Light,"" and again in 1873. The lectures remained a standard summary of the wave theory of light until Maxwell's electromagnetism.","lloyd's lectures on physical optics are in two parts: Unpolarized and polarized light. The six lectures of Part I consider the physical optics of unpolarized light, culminating in the theories of Thomas Young and the Augustin Fresnel. Along the way, a review of Newton's theory of Fits of easy Reflexion and Transmission is given. The six lectures of Part II consider the experimental phenomena that describe and define polarized light, including Fresnel's theory and experimental verification. The last two of these lectures consider polarized light in crystals, including double refraction and conical refraction.||The material is almost entirely descriptive, with only basic algebraic and trigonometric expressions being used to describe the the characteristics of polarized light in Part II.

Ludwig Johann Schleiermacher,"Schleiermacher, Ludwig Johann",,1785-1844," ",Analytische Optik,"Schleiermacher cites the difficulty of using analytic optics in the design of dioptric instruments and attempts to remedy that by generating approximations for practical optical work. He was concerned with image sharpness, first and second order spherical and chromatic aberrations from optical elements with spherical surfaces.
","Ludiwig Johann Schleiermacher published in the Annalen der Physik und Chemie of 1828 a long article on the use of analytic optics in the design dioptric instruments and the experimental assessment of the result. Schleiermacher cites it has the germ of his <i>Analytische Optik<i>, and like the article, is limited to analytical dioptrics. He also cites the many advances made in optical theory since the approximations that were used then, particularly in off-axis analysis and the determination of aberrations. But he notes the difficulty of using such analyses, their general lack of application, and the widening gap between optical theory and practice. What Schleiermacher recognized as necessary was an entirely new set of much more accurate approximations that would allow their practical application to the analysis of off-axis rays and the reduction of aberrations. Schleiermacher's book was written to fill that need; first by deriving in the fullest way the governing equations in a suitable form, and then generating from them approximations for practical work. Schleiermacher was concerned with image sharpness, first and second order spherical and chromatic aberrations from optical elements with spherical surfaces. He notes that the recent work of Gauss on paraxial analysis reached him too late to be included. Schleiermacher was famous for teaching models he built, used to demonstrate principles. One commentator calling them ""equations in wood."" Schleiermacher's work continued to be used and his book cited till the end of the 19th century. Though the title page contains 'First Part', a second part never appeared.
","Schleiermacher's book has a long introduction and 10 chapters. The introduction begins with a brief historical review beginning with the work of Euler and Kl√ºgel. It then gives a descriptive outline of the processes used and the  general developments in the entire book. 1: Exact formulas for refraction. 2: Equations of multiple-orders of aberrations. 3: Chromatic aberrations. 4: Equations relating incident and refracted rays accounting for spherical and chromatic aberrations. 5: First order approximations. 6: Deeper analysis of aberrations. 7: Blur of small images. 8: Blur of large images. 9: Generating the greatest image clarity. 10: Instrument images. Schleiermacher establishes the governing finite-difference equations for refraction and integrates them. From these he extracts multiple-order approximations that have forms permitting practical application in lens design. This includes off-axis rays, blur of large images, field size, effect of eye position, and multiple orders of spherical and chromatic aberrations. Minimizing aberrations is accomplished by finding minima of the governing approximations involving lens parameters. The mathematical developments are elaborate and presented in considerable detail. Though highly theoretical, all the developments are informed by the goal of practical applicability.","Ludwig Schleiermacher und seine optischen Arbeiten|Boegehold, H.|In:  Forschungen zur Geschichte der Optik (Supplement to:  Zeitschrift f√ºr Instrumenten¬≠kunde), Vol 2, No 3, 1937, pp 177‚Äì244.","Analytische Optik von Dr. L.J.

","Christian Andreas Doppler full development of what is now called the Doppler Effect. To explain the color difference of double stars, Doppler proposed that their motion with respect to us (toward and away) was shifting the frequency of received radiation, and thus the apparent color. He first described his idea in a memoir published in 1842: '√úber das Farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels'. Though this is often cited as marking the appearance of the Doppler Effect, this is incorrect. This early memoir only accounted for motion of the emitting source. In the present treatise, Doppler developed his theory to include the motions of both the emitter and the receiver and thus allowed astrophysical applications.

The first and second books were specifically for use in elementary and advanced courses, respectively.","Richard Potter planed a two-volume work on geometric optics in 1845. Part One appeared in 1847. Part Two, in a second volume, appeared in 1851, along with a reprinting of the volume containing Part One. Potter's plan was to separate his textbook on geometrical optics into a first, elementary part which presented the basic aspects of reflection, refraction, mirrors, lenses, dispersion, vision, and instruments--no aspect of which reaching a level that required advanced mathematics. The second part was to treat the more advanced aspects of refractive image formation, lenses, and achromatic optics--any of which require the use of the calculus. Potter based this second part on Henry Coddington's <i>A Treatise on the Reflexion and Refraction of Light<i> of 1829 and to a lesser extent George Biddle Airy's work. Written for his own use in his courses in natural philosophy at University College London, Potter wrote the two parts specifically for use in elementary and advanced courses in optics at university. Uncharacteristically, Potters texts contain considerable material devoted to illumination and photometry which reflects, perhaps, the fact that though an experimentalist, he was a natural philosophy of the old school. But his textbooks were clear and vigorous, written long before his notorious decline. Editions appeared in 1851 and 1865. 
","Potter's textbook is in two parts, each in its own volume. Part I contains and introduction and nine chapters. 1: Photometry. 2: Reflection at plane mirrors, 3:Reflection a curved mirrors. 4: Refraction at plane surfaces. 5: Refraction at curved surfaces. 6: Refraction of homogenous light in lenses and their images. 7: Chromatics. 8: Eye and vision. 9: optical instruments. Part II contains seven chapters. 1: Photometry. 2: Reflection at plane and spherical mirrors. 3: Refraction at plane and spherical surfaces. 4: Images from lenses. 5: Achromatic and aplanatic lenses. 6: Eye pieces (oculars). 7: Caustics.  Part I presents the elementary aspects of optics, catoptrics, and dioptrics. The material is elementary but detailed enough to present principles. No mathematics above geometry and trigonometry is used. Most chapters conclude with questions for students to solve. Part II presents the advanced aspects of catoptrics and dioptrics, specifically image formation and the aberrations involved. Governing equations are presented, along with approximations that permit solutions useful in practice. Differential and integral calculus are required to follow the derivations. The material is detailed and analytic and accompanied by application of theory and equations in practical, worked-out examples.","<i>A History of the UCL Physics and Astronomy Department from 1826 - 1975<i>|Fox, J.W.|UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy|http://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/history/departmental-history/history-ucl-physics-and-astronomy-department-1826-1975||<i>A List of Educational Books for Private and University Students<i>|George Bell and Sons, London, 40 pp, NB: pp 19-20.","An Elementary Treatise on Optics: All the Requisite Propositions Carried to First Approximations; with The Construction of Optical Insturments.

Sometime in 1849, however, it appears that Fizeau and Foucault had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. They would remain rivals.¬†In 1848‚àí49, Fizeau used a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air.¬†Fizeau's early ideas and, indeed, a clearer indication of his experiment than in his published paper, is found in his sealed description (pli cachet√©) of scientific plans handed to the Acad√©mie des Sciences. Fizeau‚Äôs pli cachet√© is dated 20 January 1849 with three further remarks dated 22 January. It was accepted by the Acad√©mie des Sciences as the pli cachet√© No. 878 on the same day. Such papers were produced and maintained by the academy to settle priority disputes. ","In this paper of 1849, Fizeau presents his experiment and calculation of the speed of light, calculating a value to a better precision than the previous value determined by Ole R√∏mer in 1676. Fizeau determined the speed of light using an intense light source behind a partially silvered mirror, and a fully silvered mirrors about 8 km distant. Fizeau set up the source and partially silvered mirror at his parents' home at Suresnes and the other mirror on Montmartre, the hill on the right bank of Paris. These were 8633 meters apart. It is not usually noted that theses mirrors were in the eye pieces of two telescopes, allowing sighting, light concentration, and limited interference.  The light traveling between the mirrors was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000 km/s for the speed of light from the 28 experimental runs he made. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% higher than the modern accepted value (299,792.458 kilometers per second).

Fran√ßois Arago had adapted the rotating mirror apparatus invented in 1834 by Charles Wheatstone to determine the relative speeds of light in air and water. Faster/Slower for the wave supposition, Slower/Faster for the corpuscular. Arago's health was failing and his experimental worked ceased, but he challenged Fizeau and Foucault to devise their own experiments to settle this question. Foucault, assisted with instrument maker Paul-Gustave Froment, and Fizeau with Louis Breguet, began the competition to determine the relative speeds of light in air and water. Foucault obtained his results and reported them to the French Academy one week before Fizeau in 1850. Foucault used this experiment as the basis for his thesis submitted toward the <i>Docteur √®s Sciences<i> degree at the Sorbonne in 1853.","Foucault used a rotating mirror to provide for the comparison of two images of a single solar-illuminated aperture, each image produced by light traversing the same path length but one path was in air and the other had a portion of it in water. If the speed of light in water was faster or slow than that in air, the two images would appear shifted. Foucault's experiment gave a speed lower in water, and so favoring the hypothesis that light is a wave. The apparatus could not determine the absolute speeds of light, since it was not possible to accurate know the rotation speed of the mirror.

Macedonio Melloni,"Melloni, Macedonio",,1798-1854," ",La Thermochr√¥se,Summary of Melloni's life-long work in the characterization and measurement of thermal radiation.,"Melloni's life-long work in thermal radiation is summarized and reported in this, the first part of his <i>La Thermochr√¥se<i>. He never wrote a second part. He showed that thermal radiation presented all the optical properties that had been attributed to light: linear propagation, polarization, reflection, refraction, dispersion, diffraction, and absorption. He would eventually propose a 'unitary theory' in which thermal radiation and light were manifestations of the same radiant phenomena, differing only in wavelength. His equipment and experimental procedures were ground-breaking and helped establish experimental thermal science.","Melloni summary of his work on heat radiation and the thermal properties of materials. He described and used his sensitive thermopile and galvanometer to survey the infrared transmittance of a variety of materials. The instrument in its early form had been developed by Leopoldo Nobili but had been improved by Melloni sufficiently to detect very weak heat radiation. The instrument was called a 'thermomultiplicateur', was approximately 50 times more sensitive than any extant liquid and glass thermometer. Based on this Melloni's work became widely known. The book includes more extensive experiments and the particularly important discovery that rock salt was as transparent to heat radiation as glass was to optical radiation. Melloni would make prisms and lenses of rock salt to discover the infrared parallel to geometric optics. Melloni's work would eventually show the unity of optical and heat radiation and lead to the unification of heat, optical, and chemical radiation into a single spectrum.||The work is in four chapters. 1: On the proper instruments to measure thermal radiation, 2: On heat sources and the equal absorption which their rays experience by the action of the black smoke, 3: Thermal radiation heat in vacuum and in atmospheric air, 4: Transmission of thermal radiation by solid and liquid media.||Melloni describes his unique and pioneering experimental apparatus and methods for producing and measuring heat. This included the 'Leslie Cube', a hot, black-painted metal plate, a glowing platinum wire, and the lamp of Locatelli. He describes his sensitive thermopile and the galvanometer to detect its current.  He also described his discovery and use of rock salt to form prisms that effected thermal dispersion and by which he detected the thermal spectrum. Numerous experiments are presented to show thermal transfer properties in vacuum, air, and through various materials. ","The Infrared Pioneers--II.

George Gabriel Stokes,"Stokes, George Gabriel",,1819-1903," ",On the Change of Refrangility of Light,"Stokes discovers, investigates, and charaterizes fluorescence.","The seeming ability of certain liquids to produce two colors of light from one, had been known since Kircher described the phenomena using an extract of 'lignum nephriticum' in his <i>Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae<i> of 1646. Though there was considerable interest in this phenomenon during the late 17th century, during the 18th century the phenomenon was eclipsed in importance by other optical questions. But at the beginning of 19th century, crystalline minerals such as fluorspar, were found to behave as did the solutions. It was initially thought the the additional color of light was produced by some type of scattering or dispersion. But Stokes showed the light to be a true emission, brought about by the action of incident light. This is now recognized as a type of phosphorescence of short duration. Stokes coined the term 'fluorescence' from the fluorspar used in his experiments.||Stokes noticed and described that the emitted light was always 'degraded'--that is, had longer wavelengths than the incident light. This became known as Stokes' Law of Fluorescence.' The shift in wavelength of the incident to the fluorescently emitted light came to be called the 'Stokes Shift.' Stokes' paper initiated wide-spread interest in fluorescence experimentation in the second half of the 19th century, notably by Eugen von Lommel. Stokes paper established the modern field of luminescence.","Stokes' paper was 100 pages long and one of the most thorough on the subject. It is based on earlier work of the mineralogist  Ren√© Just Ha√ºy, and that of John Herschel, and David Brewster. Stokes described two methods to study the phosphorescent phenomenon he called 'fluorescence.' The first used filters to select incident and detect fluorescently emitted light. The second was spectrographic: prismatic dispersion was used to select the illuminating light and observe any fluorescently emitted light. It was the second method that clearly showed the universality of the long wavelength shift of the emitted light. A solution of quinine showed this phenomena in a spectacular way: A test tube of solution glowed blue when illuminated by ultra-violet light.||Stokes experiments were very complete, studying the spectrum of fluorescently emitted light, the types and amplitude of fluorescence produced by various input spectra, the effect of various sources (such as electric sparks), the effect of concentration on amplitude of fluorescence, so-called quenching, and produced a long list of substances that fluoresced.

Beer's text is an elaborate, carefully presented, mathematically detailed consideration of physical optics. The preface states his reason for writing the book: to bridge the gap between the 'less profound textbooks' and the the exhaustive, specialized treatises and articles of the various authorities. The preface also make clear that Beer considered the undulatory theory of light to be capable of explaining all optical phenomena: reflection, refraction, diffraction, dispersion, propagation, color, polarization, and double refraction.||Beer sees his task as not only presenting in necessary detail the undulatory theory of light but also showing its great explanatory power by using to analyze optical phenomena in crystals.||Beer's text achieved a high and widely-held reputation and, along with F√©lix Billet's <i>Traite d'Optique Physique<i>, would not surpassed until Paul Drude's <i>Lehrbuch der Optik<i> nearly 50 years later with its presentation of electro-magnetic theory. Editions of Beer's work appeared in 1853 and 1882. A French translation appeared in 1858. 
","Beer's text is in two parts, the first setting the principles of the undulatory theory of light and its propagation in isotropic media.

Jules Antoine Lissajous,"Lissajous, Jules Antoine",,1822-1880," ",Memoire sur Etude optique,Lissajous's description of his figures that display in a concise way magnitude and phase of vibrations,"Lissajous was interested in demonstrating vibrations in way that were not did require the sense of hearing. This long article is his most important research, and describes his invention of a way to study acoustic vibrations by reflecting a light beam from the vibrating object onto a screen. The shapes came to be called Lissajous Figures and display in a concise way the frequency, phase, and amplitude of vibrations. This is an early example of the application of optics to use light as an investigative tool.
","Lissajous produced two kinds of luminous curves. In the first kind, light is reflected from a tuning fork with a small mirror is attached and then from a large mirror that is rotated rapidly. The second kind of curve, named the 'Lissajous Figure,' is more useful and is still used in many acoustical applications. The light beam is successively reflected from mirrors on two forks that are vibrating about mutually perpendicular axes. Persistence of vision causes various curves, whose shapes depend on the relative frequency, phase, and amplitude of the forks' vibrations. Lissajous presents the mathematics that define the curves and from that develops concise ways to specify characteristics of the vibrations based on the number, orientation, ellipticity, and size of the loops of the figures. These are Lissajous curves. The memoire is accompanied by two large plates, the first showing the apparatus and the second showing the figures produced by various sounds.","<i>Adventures with Lissajous Figures<i>|Greenslade, T.|IOP ebooks, 2018, NB: pp 2.1 - 2.14.","Memoire sur Etude optique des mouvements vibratoires.

Humphrey Lloyd,"Lloyd, Humphrey",,1800-1881," ",Elementary Treatise on the Wave-Theory of Light (a),"Lloyd's treatise explains most optical phenomena using Fresnel's wave theory of light and Cauchy's theory of the luminiferous aether. An extraction and simplification of his earlier book on light.
","Humphrey Lloyd delivered six lectures on the wave theory of light at Trinity College Dublin in 1835-1836. These were expanded and Lloyd published his <i>Lectures on the Wave Theory of Light<i> in 1841 to satisfy a requirement of the chair of natural philosophy he held at Dublin at the time. The need for a text in English on physical optics had grown considerably in the 15 years since the publication of those lectures, owing to many theoretical and experimental advances that had been made. Unlike the Lecture of 1841 which separated the study of unpolarized and polarized light, Lloyd's new treatise presents physical optics as a unity, eliminates references to Newtonian corpuscular theory, and explains most optical phenomena using Fresnel's wave theory of light and Cauchy's theory of the luminiferous aether. But like the <i>Lectures<i> of 1841, the new treatise is essentially descriptive, with results given without derivation and required mathematics never rising above trigonometry. Lloyd directs the reader interested in and capable of expositions involving higher mathematics to Herschel article 'Light' that had appeared in the <i>Encyclop√¶dia Metropolitana<i> in 1828 and to Airy's Tracts of 1831. For explanations of then-recent developments, Lloyd relies on his own report on the state of physical optics prepared for the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting of 1834 and on Moigno's vast literature review and bibliography of 1847-1850. Lloyd‚Äôs treatise was used as a textbook for many years, was one of the most important sources in English for and introduction to the wave theory of light, and was only superseded with the advent of Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic fields. Though the title page states 'Second Edition, with Additions,' the reference is to Llyod's lectures of 1841; this is essentially a new work. Editions of the treatise appeared in 1857 and 1873.
","Lloyd's treatise contains 218 articles in 13 chapters. 1: Propagation of light. 2: Reflection and refractions. 3: Dispersion. 4: Double refraction. 5: Interference. 6: Diffraction. 7: Colors of thin plates. 8: Polarization. 9: Transverse wave and reflection of polarized light. 10: Elliptic polarization. 11: Fresnel's theory of double refraction. 12: Interference of polarized light. 13: Rotary polarization. Though entirely descriptive, the material is very detailed. In each chapter there are two types of material: the first are detailed descriptions of optical phenomena and the way in which the wave theory accounts for or predict them; the second are citations and descriptions of works (mostly journal articles) that clarify or add important detail to the wave theory--mostly since the theory was first formed in the 1820's. The list of contributors in the latter case is extensive and among them is Foucault and Fizeau's work determining the relative speed of light in air and water the results of which aligned with the wave theory. The text takes the luminiferous aether as a given.","The Dublin Mathematical School in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century|McConnell, A. J.|<i>Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

","Pierre Forthomme's close French translation of Beer's <i>Einleitung in die h√∂here Optik<i> of 1853. August Beer was a mathematical physicist, with a particular interest in optics. Beer's text is an elaborate, carefully presented, mathematically detailed consideration of physical optics. The preface states his reason for writing the book: to bridge the gap between the 'less profound textbooks' and the the exhaustive, specialized treatises and articles of the various authorities. The preface also make clear that Beer considered the undulatory theory of light to be capable of explaining all optical phenomena: reflection, refraction, diffraction, dispersion, propagation, color, polarization, and double refraction.||Beer sees his task as not only presenting in necessary detail the undulatory theory of light but also showing its great explanatory power by using to analyze optical phenomena in crystals.||Beer's text achieved a high and widely-held reputation and, along with F√©lix Billet's <i>Traite d'Optique Physique<i>, would not surpassed until Paul Drude's <i>Lehrbuch der Optik<i> nearly 50 years later with its presentation of electro-magnetic theory. English editions of Beer's work appeared in 1853 and 1882, this translation appeared in 1858. ","Beer's text is in two parts, the first setting the principles of the undulatory theory of light and its propagation in isotropic media. The second part applies the theory developed in the first part to the derivation of mathematical expression for optical phenomena including dispersion and propagation in crystals and birefringence.||Part One is in 11 chapters. 1: Wave theory principles; 2: Propagation of light: 3: Refraction and change in media and dispersion; 4: Polarization in birefringence; 5: Mathematics of light propagation; 6: Interference of Polarized light; 7: Elliptical Polarization; 8: Unpolarized light; 9: Photometric analysis; 10: Partially Polarized light; 11: Apparatus for detecting polarized light.||Part Two is in 12 chapters. 1: Analytic derivation of propagation equations; 2: Law of dispersion; 3: Propagation in crystals; 4: Structures of crystals; 5 & 6: Propagation equations applied to crystals; 7: Law of dispersion; 8: Propagation equations applied to crystals; 9: Wave surfaces in crystals; 10: Refraction in biaxial crystals; 11: Optical properties of biaxial crystals; 12: Apparatus for studying propagation of light in crystals.||Part one sets out the undulatory theory in a descriptive but thorough way.

","F√©lix Billet's 1200-page <i>Trait√©<i> is one of the last, extensive expositions of physical optics before the advance of the theory of electromagnetic fields. Billet excludes catoptrics, dioptrics, geometrical optics and aberrations, which he labels 'Old Optics' and also mentions his exclusion of Photometry, traditionally considered part of optics, but now left behind by developments in optics. Perhaps appropriately, he considers the development of the wave theory of light as a renewal of optics; beginning with Malus's discovery of polarization by reflection and then covering virtually all aspects of the subsequent development of the theory. Unlike some of the equally lengthy compendia of optics, the Trait√© has a unifying structure that topical and ordered from the fundamental to the complex, rather than chronological. Billet wrote his <i>Trait√©<i> to unify all the various data, equations, and phenomena in optics in the previous 30 years, providing for the mathematically-capable student a complete overview of wave optics. Among he several conceptual innovations was the coherence and incoherence of light--terms is first introduced. With this work, Billet established his reputation in the field of optics.
","Bilett's <i>Traite<i> is in 24 chapters with additional notes. 1: Fundamental concepts including wave movement, propagation speed, amplitude. 2: Fundamental constants of optics including the speed of light in various media, wavelength, analogy with sound, Doppler effect. 3: Wave motion. 4:  Interference of unpolarized light including colors of thin plates and Newton's rings. 5: Diffraction including Fresnel's work and Schwerd's diffraction calculations and experiments. 6: Double refraction including its crystal geometry and analysis. 7: Linear polarization phenomena. 8: Modern optical instruments based on the 'new optics.' 9: Linear polarization theory for reflection and refraction. 10: Interference of polarized light. 11: Production and phenomena of circularly and elliptically polarized light. 12: Theory of circularly and elliptically polarized light. 13: Circularly and elliptically polarized light by total internal reflection. 14: Circularly and elliptically polarized light by reflection at metal and glass. 15: Linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized light by crystalline reflection. 16: Measurement of polarization characteristics. 17: Circular double refraction. 18: Rotary chromatic polarization. 19: Chromatic polarization of circularly, and elliptically polarized light. 20: Rotary polarization experiments including magnetic polarization rotation. 21: Rotary polarization and chemistry. 22: Rotary polarization and crystallography. 23: Experimental methods of de S√©narmont. 24: Elliptical double refraction in quartz. 25: Theory of double refraction including conical refraction. Chapters 1 through 10 cover the more fundamental aspects of light's wave theory. In these early chapters Billet often provides historical commentary regarding the development and reception of the then-revolutionary ideas. Chapters 11 through 25 become increasingly narrower in scope, greater in detail, and generally more arcane. The overall work is highly detailed and analytic.","<i>History of the Principle of Interference of Light<i>|Kipnis, N.|Springer, Basel, 1991, 271 pp, NB pp 124, 236-237.","Traite d'Optique Physique, Par M.F.

William and Robert Chambers,"Chambers, William and Robert",,," ",Optics,"An elementary but systematic exposition of the properties of light and laws of Vision. Representative of mid-19th century school books covering aspects of natural philosophy.
","Between 1835 and 1850 the Chambers brothers published the inaugural series consisting of 68 textbooks specifically written for grammar school use. By the time of the publication of this volume devoted to optics in 1858, the series consisted of 133 books. Subjects included English, Writing and Drawing, Geography, History, Arithmetic and Mathematics, Science, Latin, German, and Music. Since their inception, the books were intended to be read by students, adhering the the Chambers's belief that education must arise from the familiar, the practical, and the easily apprehended; not from abstraction and not by memorization. Often written by teachers, the books were specifically structured to assist the teacher, and the language used was commensurate with grammar school student skill and vocabulary. By 1860 Chambers brothers' textbooks began to be used in Canada and the United States.||The prefaces states the intention: 'to present a systematic exposition of the properties of light and laws of Vision.' The book covers all aspects of optics involving light and vision, presented in an elementary but thorough manner, at a level appropriate for students net yet in university. The style is descriptive--no mathematics above elementary geometry is used--and relies heavily on the figures that accompany the text. The structure and completeness of the material permitted the book's use for self-study or in a school course. This text optics first appeared in 1850.
","The text is in seven sections. 1: General Observations, covering the nature and propagation of light. 2: Reflection, covering plane and spherical mirrors, images from mirrors. 3: Refraction, covering law of refraction, prisms, atmospheric refraction, spherical lenses, foci and images from lenses, compound lenses. 4: Prismatic colors. 5: Optical Instruments, covering magnification, solar microscope and magic lantern, telescopes, microscopes. 6: The Eye and Vision, covering anatomy, eye function, vision and perception. 7: Physics Optics, covering interference, diffraction, polarization, double refraction, chromatic phenomena, polarized interference.||The material is elementary and simply presentational; no derivations are presented. Light rays are presented as the principle manifestation of light, and are used in the geometric optics that is covered. Mirrors and lenses are simply described, with chromatic aberration described but not considered analytically. Most sections have at least one Example to demonstrate the principle or idea being presented.","<i>Publishers for the People<i>|Cooney, S.M.|Dissertation, Ohio State University, 1971, 270 pp, NB: pp 153-213.|http://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1486661662987297&disposition=inline.||Business and Reading Across the Atlantic: W. & R.

He chides Thomas Young for his dismissal of Euler's early efforts at the mathematization of lens design. He outlines how basic principles and mathematical analysis can be used in lens design; specifically by building a practical mathematical apparatus for modeling off optical axis geometric lens aberrations (spherical and coma aberrations) . Using the aberration theory developed by Mossotti, Giovanni Battista Amici designed and built an achromatic triplet of 6-inch aperture and 52-inch focal length that was corrected for geometric aberrations. Mossotti summarized the events that lead up to this work by Amici and how he considered it a test of his aberration theory. Amici's successful lens that convinced Mossotti to publish this work. Parts of work appeared in the Annali delle Universit√† Toscane, and the forth part (on the design of an aplanatic lens) appeared as a long entry in the journal Il Nuovo Cimento for December 1859.||Mossotti's theory was recognized as a significant step forward in practical lens design and he was held to be one of the greatest optical theoreticians of his time.
","Mossotti sets out a theory for the correction of geometric lens aberrations that can be applied to achromatic lenses involved multiple elements. The work is in four parts. 1: Ray-tracing through optical instruments of many surfaces. 2: First approximations to geometric lens aberrations. 3: Second approximations to geometric lens aberrations. 4: Application of the theory to a multiple-element aplanatic lens. The work is detailed, clearly laid out, and densely mathematical. Examples of the principles are given for microscopes and telescopes as they are developed. The fourth and final part is in bristling mathematical detail, including elaborately documented numerical calculations leading to the specification of the shape of all the lens surfaces involved.","The Production of achromatic objectics in the first half of the nineteenth century: The Contributions of Giovanni Battista Amici|Proverbio, E.|<i>Memorie della Societ√† Astronomia Italiana<i>, Vol 61, No 4, p 829-875.||Su di un obiettivo costruito dall‚ÄôAmici se- condo la teoria del Mossotti|Morais, C|In:<i> Physis<i>, Vol 2, 1965, pp 202-210.",Nuova Teoria Degli Stromenti Ottici,A New Theory of Optical Instruments,,1859,1850-1875,"Italian-born physicist, taught at the University of Buenos Aires and then at Tuscany.

Stephen Parkinson,"Parkinson, Stephen",,1823-1889," ",A Treatise on Optics,"Parkinson's first extensive revision and emendation of the second edition of William Nathaniel Griffin's optics textbook that had appeared in 1842.
","The first edition of Stephen Parkinson's extensive revision and emendation of the second edition of William Nathaniel Griffin's optics textbook that had appeared in 1842. Parkinson rearranged the material and made additions which altered the nature of the book considerably. Unlike Griffin's original text, Parkinson's book has enough additional explanation and detailed worked examples and problems--particularly in the second and third  editions--to make it accessible for self-study or a reading course in university. That is, it is considerably more independent of a course of lectures. To this end Parkinson provides a suggested course of reading for either self-study or to prepare for examinations. As with Griffin's original, Parkinson's revision deals only with geometrical optics. Parkinson's textbook became a standard and was used for many years. It was, for example, the text used by J.W. Strutt, Lord Rayleigh in his undergraduate optics course at Cambridge. Editions appeared in 1859, 1866, and 1870.
","Parkinson's textbook has 11 chapters. 1: General properties of light, direct reflection and refraction, rays and pencils of rays, reflection and refraction at spherical surfaces, geometrical focus, spherical aberration, reflection and refraction at parabolas and hyperbolas. 2: Illumination of surfaces. 3: Aberration of pencils by refraction at spherical surfaces. 4: Focal lines and caustics of pencils. 5: Successive reflections and refractions in prisms and lenses. 6: Paths of pencils through systems of multiple surfaces. 7: Spherical aberrations. 8: Images from reflection and refraction. 9: Chromatic dispersion. 10: Vision and optical instruments. 11: The rainbow and halos. The material is detailed and analytic. The development of lens analysis is very detailed, particularly the off-optical-axis analysis and aberrations. Applications of analysis to telescopes, microscopes, and other instruments is concise in the extreme. More elaborate is the explanation and solution of problems in geometrical optics posed throughout the text.","The Principles and Methods of Geometrical Optics: Especially as Applied to the Theory of Optical Instruments|Southall, J.P.C.|MacMillan, 1910, 626 pp, NB: pp v-vi.","A Treatise on Optics  by S.

Gieswald describes the need to update Barfuss's text, maintaining its focus on applications while updating the theoretical parts to align with optical developments in the intervening 20 years. The most significant changes being the elimination of the long introductory section on perspective and the added theoretical detail in the sections on physical optics. Another editing of Barfuss's text by Ferdinand Meisel appeared in 1889.
","Gieswald's edition of Barfuss' compendium is in ten chapters. 1: General remarks on light, its generation and propagation, shadows, and reflection. 2: Laws of reflection, mirrors, analysis of plane and curved mirrors, images from mirrors, description of mirrored instrument operation, mirror anamorphosis. 3: Laws of refraction, refraction and plane and curved surfaces, operation of prisms, prismatic colors, index of refraction and dispersion, measurement, description of refractive instrument operation. 4: Lenses, types of lenses, analysis of lenses, calculating focal lengths and image position and size, spherical aberration, chromatic aberration. 5: Simple lensed instruments, camera lucida, camera obscura, magic lantern, the eye and eye-function, spectacles for vision correction. 6: Lensed telescopes, general form, types, magnification, achromatic objectives, discussion of recent practical lens work, example telescopes, telescope configuration and use. 7: Microscopes, simple and compound, field of view and magnification, objective and ocular combinations, chromatic and spherical aberration correction, illumination methods, mirrored microscopes, solar microscope. 8: Interference and diffraction.  9: Polarization. 10: Instrument making, optical glass, glass properties, lens grinding, figuring and polishing, machine and hand work, mirror making.

James Clerk Maxwell,"Maxwell, James Clerk",,1831-1879," ",On the Theory of Compound Colours and the Relations of the Colours of the Spectrum,"Maxwell's paper on color perception, color specification, and what is now called colorimetry. It marks the final separation of color science from optics, establishing it as a separate field of study and research.
","Maxwell's interest in color and color vision has its origin when he was a student at the University of Edinburgh and joined the color vision research program of the physicist J.D. Forbes. in 1849. Maxwell continued this work in 1854 when he was at Cambridge. He began with the trichromatic color theory of Thomas Young which was an important effect of the paper: drawing attention to Young's theory. Maxwell's initial experiments blended colors by using visual persistence and three colors presented on a rapidly rotating wheel. The proportion of each of the components was determined by the size of the wedge on the wheel. This method was replaced with evermore sophisticated viewing boxes that allowed three narrow bands of chosen from the solar spectrum to be combined in arbitrary proportion. This apparatus, the trichromator, was fundamental to the development and result of Maxwell's research and is described in the paper. One aspect of the instrument's design was the development of the eponymous 'Maxwellian View' that produced a uniform field for observation.||The paper introduced the concept of metameric color matches--different physical stimuli producing the same perceptual response. It also described dichromatic vision or 'color blindness.' and establishes the concept of a 'color space.' The paper marks the separation of color science and color perception from optics, establishing color, its specification, and its perception as a field of research and study in its own right.","Maxwell begins the paper with a review of color theory, adopting Thomas Young's trichromatic theory and establishing a three dimensional color space, each dimension corresponding to the stimulus of each of the three types of sensors in the eye. Importantly, he established 'The Principle of Univariance'--wavelength information is not retained, only the amount of light. This color space led to the linear algebra of color equations that would be used to described and specify metameric color matches. The paper then describes Maxwell's trichromator and its use in determining what are now called color-matching functions of normal human color vision. This included his 'Method of determining the Wave-length corresponding to any point the Spectrum.'  Interestingly, Maxwell's error analysis of his experimental results lead him to discover that vision is more sensitive to chromatic difference than to brightness difference. His experiments also revealed individual differences in color vision, the 'Maxwell Spot,' a description of dichromatic color vision or 'color blindness,' and the elaborate process he used to determine the spectral sensitivities of the three color sensors in the eye.","Classical Articles in Color|Zaidi, Q.|<i>Color Research and Application<i>, Vol 18, No 4, 1993, pp 270-287.","""On the Theory of Compound Colours and the Relations of the Colours of the Spectrum.""

Jabez Hogg,"Hogg, Jabez",,1817-1899," ",Elements of Experimental and Natural Philosophy,"An example of mid-19th century British tracts written for a wide, general audience with an interest in the many aspects of natural philosophy but without any mathematical background.","Second edition of Jabez Hogg's text of 1853 was prompted by the success of the first edition--selling 10,000 copies in seven years. The book is an example of mid-19th century British tracts written for a wide, general audience with an interest in the many aspects of natural philosophy but without any mathematical background. Considerably expanded from its first edition, Hogg assembled the main components of the several topics he covered for exposition, sometimes uncritically. Though a medical man active in ophthalmology, he relies on other sources for most of the material he presents. For some topics, he is quite behind the times. He presents, for example, the wave theory of heat which most physicists had abandoned.||Editions appeared in 1853 and 1861. This second edition received some revision and updating by the author and included many new figures. Hogg's work was also issued as part of Bonn's 'Scientific Library.'

In 1861 he began working on the experiment to measure the speed of light. As in 1850, Foucault was assisted by the instrument maker Paul-Gustave Froment. The apparatus was an extension and refinement of that of the 1850 experiment and after one year of work, Foucault announced his result.","Foucault used a rotating mirror to provide for the comparison of two images of a single solarly illuminated aperture. The mirror, rotating at 400 rps, slightly displaced the image of the aperture, as light traveled a distance of 40 meters, by way of 5 concave mirrors. A rotating toothed wheel allowed the sweeping images produced by the mirror to be interrupted, and so produced two adjacent but shifted image positions. Foucault announced his result in September of 1862: 'in round numbers, 298 millions' of kilometers per second, with an uncertainty of 1/2 million. The description of the apparatus appeared later that same year, on 17 November.","‚ÅÇ 'Toothed wheels and rotating mirrors: Parisian astronomy and mid-nineteenth century experimental measurements of the speed of light'|Tobin, W.|<i>Vistas in Astronomy<i>, Vol 30, No 3, 1993, pp 253-294.","D√©termination exp√©rimentale de la vitesse de la lumi√®re; parallaxe du Soleil.

","George Biddell Airy added the monograph-length essay 'On the Undulatory Theory of Optics' to the second, 1831 edition of his <i>Mathematical Tracts<i>, first published in 1826 and appearing in all subsequent editions of the <i>Mathematical Tracts<i>. This is the first edition in book form, published with Airy's approval. Given the scope and intent of the work, the content is little changed from that in the Essay. Airy wrote on the wave theory of light with the same certainty of correctness with which he held the theory of gravity. He held the wave theory of light to be  '... certainly true, and that, by mathematical operations of general elegance, it leads to results of great interest. With regard to the evidence for this theory; if the simplicity of a hypothesis, which explains with accuracy a vast variety of phaenomena of the most complicated kind, can be considered a proof of its correctness, I believe there is no physical theory so firmly established as the theory in question.' Airy was one of the earliest British natural philosophers to accept the wave theory and he wrote extensively in its support. The current essay brought together aspects of the theory Airy considered to be its core, and presented them with his typical clear yet detailed manner. He believed that experimental data and phenomena needed to be considered along with mathematical theory; to that end Airy personally performed each experiment described in the essay. Interestingly, Airy separates the simpler assumptions  in the theory that have proven to be powerfully predictive--transverse waves, varying speeds, and such, all of which he calls the geometrical part of the wave theory--from what he calls the mechanical part of the theory--Cauchy's assumption of the aether as a 3-dimentional lattice and everything that followed from that. That later he considered probable but 'far from certain.' Editions appeared in 1866, 1877, and 1887.
","Airy's book is in several unlabeled sections. 1: General theory of undulations including the theory and mathematics of waves, wave interference, wave length, wave phase. 2: Application of wave theory to unpolarized light, including diffraction pattern positions and intensities, wave fronts, reflection, refraction, reflection and refraction both, unequal (chromatic) refraction.  3: Experiments involving optical phenomena including interference fringes, chromatic interference, prismatic interference, phase shifting with glass plates, thin plates, Newton's rings, diffraction fringes, diffraction from a rectangular aperture, colored fringes, lenses and apertures and wire gratings, diffraction spectra. 4: Double refraction including crystal properties, experiments with polarized light, relation to the hypothesis of the nature of light, transverse waves, general explanation of double refraction, conical refraction. 5: Aspects of the wave theory including predicted values of reflection from glass, total internal reflection, circularly and elliptically polarized light, reflection from metals, colored polarization, polarization in crystals with multiple axes.

The 'reversal of spectra' to is how absorption spectra were referred to; they absorbed rather than emitted.  Kirchhoff's experiments with Robert Bunsen created a link between the chemical elements, known and unknown, and a signature of spectral lines that could be detected with a spectrograph.

Louis Denis Jules Gavarret,"Gavarret, Louis Denis Jules",,1809-1890," ",Des images par reflexion et par refraction,"A textbook written to present Gaussian Optics without freighting it with mathematics any more advanced than geometry.","Louis Denis Jules Gavarret wrote this textbook to present Gaussian Optics without freighting it with mathematics any more advanced than geometry. That is, mathematics sufficient to use Gauss's work but not derive or prove its correctness. Gavarret's purpose was to provide a text that made Gauss's dioptric formulation available to students who needed to understand systems of lenses used in optical instruments and the functioning of the human eye. Gauss's developments allowed for the evaluation of complex lens systems with just a few parameters as well as accounting for the thickness of lenses. Although Gavarret's text considers images by reflection, the bulk of the material centers on image formation by lenses. This is one of many texts written by Gavarret covering a wide range of technical and subjects published by the great Parisian medical publisher Bailli√®re. A Russian translation appeared in 1891. 
","Gavarret's text is in two parts, the first is very brief and covers image formation by mirrors. It is entirely conventional catoptrics and serves only to review very basic geometrical optical notions and conventions. The bulk of the text is the second part on image formation by refraction; that is, by lenses. Gauss's cardinal points are introduced: the principal points, focal points, and the nodal points. The analysis of lenses using these basic parameters is demonstrated by increasingly complex practical examples. Many types of lenses are considered, including biconvex, biconcave, plano-concave and convex, and meniscus lenses. Each demonstration and example is accompanied by striking white-on-black geometric drawings. Gavarret's text is a thorough introduction to Gaussian Optics applied to lens analysis.","The origins of medical physics|Duck, F.A.|<i>Physica Medica<i>, Vol 30, No 4, 2014 pp 397-402.","Des images par reflexion et par refraction.

","Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel 2-volume treatise <i>La Lumi√®re<i> gathers together the results of his nearly 30 years of experimenting with the generation of light and the assessment of its effects. Becquerel was not only a physicist but also a photographer and had long had an abiding interest in the chemical effects of light, particularly as it pertained to photography. In his preface he makes it clear that is had not written an optics book, but rather something 'purely experimental, the small number of theoretical considerations which it contains have been judged necessary to unite and explain the facts. It is accepted that the vibratory motion of matter is the cause of luminous phenomena, and that the transmission of light takes place at a distance through an ethereal medium which penetrates all bodies; The hypothesis of the undulations facilitating the explanations which can be given to account for all the effects which have recorded.' Becquerel's treatise presents his pioneering work in spectroscopy, actinometry, photometry, fluorescence, phosphorescence, and chemical analysis, a large amount of experimental data on the properties of light sources and materials, as well as descriptions of the experimental apparatus he developed for his work. There is virtually no mathematics. Becquerel's treatise was of general scientific interest for the skillful acquisition, arrangement, and coordination of seeming disparate facts. The treatise was particularly important to the nascent discipline of photography, the study of fluorescent and phosphorescent chemistry, and eventually to the electric lighting industry.
","Becquerel's treatise is in two volumes. Volume 1 is devoted to sources of light and has seven books. 1: History of research in phosphorescence up to 1840. 2: Luminous effects produced by action and motion. 3: Luminous effects produced by heat. 4: Analysis of light by refraction. 5: Luminous effects produced by electricity. 6: Luminous effects produced by the action of light itself (phosphorescence and fluorescence). 7: Light produced by plants and animals. Volume 2 is devoted to the effects of light and has 5 books. 1: Heating effects. 2: Chemical effects including photoelectric effects. 3: Photographic effects. 4: Physiological effects. 5: On vision. The material in each chapter presents experiments that had been conducted by Becquerel, describing in detail the equipment and method and often accompanied by an etching showing the apparatus. These are usually followed by results and its analysis and commentary on significance.","Edmond¬†Becquerel (1820-1891).

James Clerk Maxwell,"Maxwell, James Clerk",,1831-1879," ",A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism,"Maxwell's elaborate, unsystematic presentation of the physical ideas and governing mathematics of his theory of the electromagnetic field, which arose from his desire to develop a rigorous framing of Michael Faraday's idea that fields and lines of force can explain electrical and magnetic phenomena.
","The intellectual origin of Maxwell's treatise is his study of and correspondence with Michael Faraday. Faraday, and subsequently Maxwell, held that theories of physics based on instantaneous action at a distance between particles of matter were incorrect. Maxwell developed a theory of the electromagnetic field and presented it, in its essential form, his famous paper of 1865: 'A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field.' A summary in his own words is in Maxwell's 1870 presidential address to annual meeting the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Regarding electricity and magnetism , he mentions vortex theory but described his won as 'Another theory of electricity which I prefer denies action at a distance and attributes electric action to tensions and pressure in a an all-pervading medium, these stresses being the same kind with those familiar to engineers, and the medium being identical with that in which light is supposed to be propagated.'||Between 1867 and 1870, Maxwell concentrated hid efforts on writing the <i>Treatise<i>. This was simultaneous with an effort to reform physics education at Cambridge. Examinations were expanded and a new chair of experimental physics was established. The reform, devoted mainly to electricity and magnetism, was powered, in part, by the rapid industrial developments in electricity and telegraphy. It was recognized that there were very few texts in English that could support such teaching and so the Clarendon Press accepted Maxwell's proposal for the <i>Treatise<i>. During its writing, Maxwell was in constant correspondence with Peter Guthrie Tait, Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh and Sir William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, asking advice and submitting ideas for review. Maxwell finished the book at the end of 1870. Printing of 1500 copies began in March 1871 and would take two years.||Maxwell's treatise was unsystematic, lacked a clear focus, and did not provide an orderly presentation. Central ideas were inadvertently camouflaged by descriptions of miscellaneous phenomena and so failed to stand out. The underlying physical ideas and the elaborate vector mathematics used made it inaccessible to most British physicists and to nearly all on the Continent. The power of Maxwell's ideas would only become widely known by the work and publications of 'Maxwellians' such as  G.F. Fitzgerald, Oliver Heaviside, and Oliver Lodge. Maxwell's theory would undergo continuous development and extension in its original form in the treatise of 1873 until 1890. The <i>Treatise<i> appeared in three editions: 1873, with the first nine chapters revised by Maxwell and the whole edited by W.D. Niven in 1881, and edited by J.J. Thompson in 1892.","Maxwell's Treatise has a preliminary and four parts. Preliminary On the Measurement of Quantities, Part I Electrostatics, deals with electrostatic fields produced by static electric charge and static electric displacement caused by electric polarization. Part II Electrokinematics is devoted to steady electric currents but does not consider displacement current or the magnetic fields produced by steady electric currents. Part III Magnetism, is devoted to magnetostatic fields produced by magnetization. Part IV Electromagnetism, treats magnetostatic fields of electric conduction currents as well as time-varying electromagnetic fields and sources including displacement current. This includes Chapter XX, Electromagnetic Theory of Light.||The central result of the Treatise are equations that both state and govern electromagnetic fields. Two of the equations state the laws valid for static electric and magnetic systems. The third provided a mathematical description of the laws governing magnetic induction: the generation of an electric field by a changing magnetic field. The fourth gave a description of Ampere's law: the magnetic field associated with a (steady) electric current. Remarkably, Maxwell added a term representing the magnetic field produced by a changing electric field. This seemed to be a symmetric requirement, complementary to the electric current induced by a changing magnetic field. This is one of the most remarkable developments in the Treatise: that the total current must be considered as the current of conduction and the time variation of the electric displacement.||Maxwell used vectors and vector notation (a notation subset of Quaternions) and the original formulation of his governing equations is in coupled differential equation form. Though he uses vectors and vector operators, the results are usually expressed in component form, often resulting in bristling complexity. Maxwell often states equations in their integral form. He summaries the equations of the Treatise in Article 619 (Volume 2) though, strangely, that equation governing electromagnetic induction (Faraday's Law) is not included.||The culmination of the Treatise is Chapter XX of Part IV, 'Electromagnetic Theory of Light'. Maxwell proposes that 'if the velocity of propagation of electromagnetic disturbances is the same as the velocity of light, and this not only in air, but in other transparent media, we shall have strong reasons for believing that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon.' He derives the velocity of an electromagnetic disturbance in a nonconducting medium as (Œº Œµ)‚Äæ¬π‚Ä≤¬≤, Œº and Œµ being its permeability and permittivity. Using measured values of Œº‚Çí Œµ‚Çí, the permeability and permittivity of free space, he compares  (Œº‚Çí Œµ‚Çí)‚Äæ¬π‚Ä≤¬≤  with the then generally accepted values for the speed of light in (empty) space and finds agreement within 10%, showing that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell then considers plane-wave light propagation, the energy in a propagating light wave, radiation pressure in a light wave, and light waves in conducting media.","Reflections on Maxwell's Treatise|Yaghjian, A.D.|<i>Progress In Electromagnetics Research<i>, Vol 149, 2014, pp 217-249.||<i>From Maxwell to Microphysics<i>|Buchwald, J.Z.|University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1985, 339 pp, NB: ppp 20-40.||<i>The Maxwellians<i>|Hunt, B.J.|Cornell University Press, 1991, 266 p.",A Treatise on Electicity and Magnetism,,,1873,1850-1875,"Scottish mathematical physcist, academic.

George Biddell Airy,"Airy, George Biddell",,1801-1892," ",On the Undulatory Theory of Optics,"Airy added the monograph-length essay <i>On the Undulatory Theory of Optics<i> to the second, 1831 edition of his Mathematical Tracts.","George Biddell Airy added the monograph-length essay 'On the Undulatory Theory of Optics' to the second, 1831 edition of his <i>Mathematical Tracts<i>, first published in 1826 and appearing in all subsequent editions of the Mathematical Tracts. This is the first edition in book form, published with Airy's approval. Given the scope and intent of the work, the content is little changed from that in the Essay. Airy wrote on the wave theory of light with the same certainty of correctness with which he held the theory of gravity. He held the wave theory of light to be  '... certainly true, and that, by mathematical operations of general elegance, it leads to results of great interest. With regard to the evidence for this theory; if the simplicity of a hypothesis, which explains with accuracy a vast variety of phaenomena of the most complicated kind, can be considered a proof of its correctness, I believe there is no physical theory so firmly established as the theory in question.' Airy was one of the earliest British natural philosophers to accept the wave theory and he wrote extensively in its support. The current essay brought together aspects of the theory Airy considered to be its core, and presented them with his typical clear yet detailed manner. He believed that experimental data and phenomena needed to be considered along with mathematical theory; to that end Airy personally performed each experiment described in the essay. Interestingly, Airy separates the simpler assumptions  in the theory that have proven to be powerfully predictive--transverse waves, varying speeds, and such, all of which he calls the geometrical part of the wave theory--from what he calls the mechanical part of the theory--Cauchy's assumption of the aether as a 3-dimentional lattice and everything that followed from that. That later he considered probable but 'far from certain.' The title pages labels this 'A New Edition', though it is essentially a reprint of that of 1866. Editions appeared in 1866, 1877, and 1887.
","Airy's book is in several unlabeled sections. 1: General theory of undulations including the theory and mathematics of waves, wave interference, wave length, wave phase. 2: Application of wave theory to unpolarized light, including diffraction pattern positions and intensities, wave fronts, reflection, refraction, reflection and refraction both, unequal (chromatic) refraction.  3: Experiments involving optical phenomena including interference fringes, chromatic interference, prismatic interference, phase shifting with glass plates, thin plates, Newton's rings, diffraction fringes, diffraction from a rectangular aperture, colored fringes, lenses and apertures and wire gratings, diffraction spectra. 4: Double refraction including crystal properties, experiments with polarized light, relation to the hypothesis of the nature of light, transverse waves, general explanation of double refraction, conical refraction. 5: Aspects of the wave theory including predicted values of reflection from glass, total internal reflection, circularly and elliptically polarized light, reflection from metals, colored polarization, polarization in crystals with multiple axes. The material is detailed and highly analytic, with experimental optical phenomena and mathematical developments closely coupled.","The Reception of the Wave Theory of Light in Britain: A Case Study Illustrating the Role of Methodology in Scientific Debate|Canntory G.|<i>Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences<i>, Vol 6, 1975, pp 109-132.",On the Undulatory Theory of Optics,,,1877,1875-1900,"British mathematician, astronomer.

Galileo Ferraris,"Ferraris, Galileo",,1847-1897," ",Le proprietaÃÄ cardinali degli strumenti diottrici,"Ferraris was convinced that Gauss's developments in dioptrics could be presented without the advanced mathematics necessary to derive or prove results. Once simply presented, they could be used with only geometry.
","Galileo Ferraris saw the need for a textbook on Gaussian Optics and was inspired by other textbooks on the subject, particularly that of Louis Denis Jules Gavarret of 1867. Like Gavarret, Ferraris was convinced that Gauss's developments in dioptrics could be presented without the advanced mathematics necessary to derive or prove results, but once simply presented they could be used with only geometry. Unlike Gavarret, Ferraris considered it necessary to show Gaussian Optics applied in detail to many practical problems if the student was to fully understand the concepts. To that end, Ferraris's book is in two parts, the first presents Gaussian Optics in outline, the second and considerably longer shows the analysis of several optical systems. The work was reprinted in 1902 as Volume 3 of his <i>Opere<i> and by Hoepli in 1921. A German translation appeared in 1879 and an English translation in 1919.
","Ferraris introduces Gauss's cardinal points of a lens: the principal points, focal points, and the nodal points; and then shows how they are related to parameters of the lens involved and how they can be used to analyze it. The same analysis is then performed for a system of two lenses. In the second part of the book, the analysis of lenses using these basic parameters is demonstrated by increasingly complex practical examples, showing how image analysis is performed, giving magnification, clarity, field of view, and placement. Several types of lenses are considered, how they are analyzed, and how they are used in instruments including telescopes and microscopes. Like Gavarret's text, Ferraris's book is illustrated with diagrams of white-on-black.","Ferraris, Galileo|Lerda, F.|Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Vol 46,  1996.||Numerical Work.

Geoorge Francis FitzGerald,"FitzGerald, Geoorge Francis",,1851-1901," ",On the Electromagnetic Theory of the Reflection and Refraction of Light.,"The first application of Maxwell's theory of Electro-Magnetic fields to explain and predict reflection and refraction.
","George FitzGerald was one of the earliest British physicists to understand and appreciate Maxwell's work in Electro-Magnetic fields. FitzGerald would communicate frequently with Heaviside, Hertz and Lorentz who were the other active developers of Maxwell's ideas. By 1880 FitzGerald has considerable command of the theory and its mathematics and states in its first paragraph why he wrote this paper: ""In the second volume of his ‚ÄòElectricity and Magnetism‚Äô Professor J. Clerk Maxwell has proposed a very remarkable electromagnetic theory of light, and has worked out the results as far as the transmission of light through uniform crystalline and magnetic media are concerned, leaving the questions of reflection and refraction untouched. These, however, may be very conveniently studied from his point of view.' Maxwell himself was one of the referee's of FitzGerald's paper. After explaining that the difficulties involved in applying his theory to reflection and refraction were the reason why such an application did not appear in his treatise, Maxwell noted that FitzGerald's development paralleled that of Lorentz. FitzGerald's paper presents the first complete theory of reflection and refraction based on Maxwell's Electro-Magnetic fields.
","FitzGerald formulated appropriate boundary conditions at the surfaces of media and then interpreted these conditions in terms of electro-magnetic variables. FitzGerald takes up the theory presented by James MacCullagh in 1839, which gave laws of reflection and refraction based on purely mechanical effects of the luminiferous aether. FitzGerald casts this in Maxwellian form. Working in both Cartesian and Quaternion forms, FitzGerald uses Lagrange's equations of motion to establish expressions for reflected and refracted waves. An elaborate application of integration by parts is used to render the required integrals and dropping vanishingly small terms gives the expected results, in alignment with Fresnel's equations. FitzGerals shows that his equations are able to predict the results obtained by John Kerr in his series of experiments conducted in 1877, now named the magneto-optic Kerr effect.","<i>The Maxwellians<i>|Hunt, B.J.|Cornell University Press, 1991, 266 pp, NB: pp 5-23.",On the Electromagnetic Theory of the Reflection and Refraction of Light.,,,1880,1875-1900,Irish natural philosopher in the University of Dubin.

","August Beer was a mathematical physicist, with a particular interest in optics. Beer's text is an elaborate, carefully presented, mathematically detailed consideration of physical optics. The preface states his reason for writing the book: to bridge the gap between the 'less profound textbooks' and the the exhaustive, specialized treatises and articles of the various authorities. The preface also make clear that Beer considered the undulatory theory of light to be capable of explaining all optical phenomena: reflection, refraction, diffraction, dispersion, propagation, color, polarization, and double refraction.||Beer sees his task as not only presenting in necessary detail the undulatory theory of light but also showing its great explanatory power by using to analyze optical phenomena in crystals.||Beer's text achieved a high and widely-held reputation and, along with F√©lix Billet's <i>Traite d'Optique Physique<i>, would not surpassed until Paul Drude's <i>Lehrbuch der Optik<i> nearly 50 years later with its presentation of electro-magnetic theory.||As the editor states in his Forward, this edition keeps the principal pedagogical purpose of the Beer's book, unalters the structure and style, and only modifies content slightly and omits all the tables of data that had been included in the first edition and which had become obsolete. Notably, and consistent with the German hesitancy about Maxwell's theory at the time, the editor does not introduce any electro-magnetics into Beer's material on physical optics.
","Beer's text is in two parts, the first setting the principles of the undulatory theory of light and its propagation in isotropic media. The second part applies the theory developed in the first part to the derivation of mathematical expression for optical phenomena including dispersion and propagation in crystals and birefringence.||Part One is in 11 chapters. 1: Wave theory principles; 2: Propagation of light: 3: Refraction and change in media and dispersion; 4: Polarization in birefringence; 5: Mathematics of light propagation; 6: Interference of Polarized light; 7: Elliptical Polarization; 8: Unpolarized light; 9: Photometric analysis; 10: Partially Polarized light; 11: Apparatus for detecting polarized light.||Part Two is in 12 chapters. 1: Analytic derivation of propagation equations; 2: Law of dispersion; 3: Propagation in crystals; 4: Structures of crystals; 5 & 6: Propagation equations applied to crystals; 7: Law of dispersion; 8: Propagation equations applied to crystals; 9: Wave surfaces in crystals; 10: Refraction in biaxial crystals; 11: Optical properties of biaxial crystals; 12: Apparatus for studying propagation of light in crystals.||Part one sets out the undulatory theory in a descriptive but thorough way.

William Thomson,"Thomson, William",Lord Kelvin,1824-1907," ",Notes of lectures on molecular dynamics and the wave theory of light,"Copy of the original, 'papyrographically' reproduced notes of William Thomson's presentations at a course of invited lectures by Thomson in Baltimore in 1884, stenographically prepared by a participant.","The occasion for these lectures was an invitation by Robert H. Gilman, then president of Johns Hopkins University, to William Thomson to present lectures on a topic of Thompson's choosing. He lectured on the wave theory of light, emphasizing it's incompleteness and faults. The idea was not to denigrate the theory but to challenge the attendees. This was what would now be called a master-class and the attendees were advanced students, professionals, and seasoned academics. A.A. Michelson and E.W. Morley were in the audience and the problems and uncertainties set out by Thomson prompted them to conduct the famed eponymous Michelson-Morley Experiment. Thomson focused on the the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation, and the nature of the medium, the luminiferous aether, that would be required to support such oscillations.||Arthur S. Hathaway, student at Johns Hopkins at the time and later instructor at Cornell, attended the meeting and, since Thomson provided no public notes, Hathaway recorded the entire proceedings, mathematics and all, in stenographic short-hand. He later transcribed his short-hand into a 328 page text with tables and index. onto the stencils required of the so-called papyrograph process for quick and low-cost reproduction. Copies of these reproduced notes appeared in December of 1884 and  were widely circulated. The demand was great enough for Hathaway to contact Thomson, attempting to arrange for letter-press printing. After long delays and revisions by Thomson, the notes finally appeared in printed form in 1904.||Thomson's lectures were delivered at the beginning of the twenty-year period in which physicists strove to rectify theory and experiment, all based on the presence of the luminiferous aether. By the time the printed version of the notes appeared, Thomson would consider most problems solved or soluble by the application of dynamics, save for one: the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment which had been conducted in 1887. Thomson wrote in the preface to the 1904 printing of the lecture notes: 'All of us will, I am sure, feel sympathetically interested in knowing that two of ourselves, Michelson and Morley, have by their great experimental work on the motion of ether relative to earth, raised the one and only serious objection against our dynamical explanations.' Thomson's lectures are one of the last, great summaries of classical physics and aether-based light-theory before the coming of relativity and the quantum revolution.
","Thomsos's lectures stated and attempted to solve the known problems regarding light's propagation and other optical phenomena. He delivered 20 lectures. Lecture 1 on kinetic theory of gases, molecular dynamics (vortex atoms), wave theory of light and its difficulties, mechanical models. Lecture 2 on motion of elastic solids (the aether). Lecture 3 on isotropic elastic solids. Lecture 4 on motion in elastic solids. Lecture 5 on vibrating globes. Lecture 6 on velocity. Lecture 7 on dispersion. Lecture 8 on other dynamic solutions. Lecture 9 on light properties. Lecture 10 on plane waves. Lecture 11 more on elastic solids. Lecture 12 more on wave motion. Lecture 13 on mechanical models of molecules (the aether). Lecture 14 more on molecules. Lecture 15 more on molecules. Lecture 16 on double refraction. Lecture 17 on polarization. Lecture 18 on the theory of reflection and refraction. Lecture 19 problem solutions. Lecture 20 additional difficulties and summary.||Lectures 1-5 set out the dynamical properties of the presumed aether. Molecular dynamics is invoked, together with the presumed nature of the aether, to explain reflection, refraction, dispersion. Along the way, the difficulties are highlighted.

Robert Samuel Heath,"Heath, Robert Samuel",,1858-??," ",A Treatise on Geometrical Optics,"An advanced textbook on geometric optics
","Heath wrote his treatise while professor of mathematics at Mason College in the University of Birmingham. Heath was not an originator in optics but a skilled compiler and expositor. His text was intended to bring together all developments in geometric optics presented in a textbook that could be used in advanced courses. His primary sources are Gauss, Listing, Maxwell, Helmholtz, and Abb√©. He also adopted sections from Humphrey Lloyd's <i>Treatise on Light and Vision<i> of 1831. The list of sources he consulted cites more than 60 works. The result is a compendium of geometrical optics as it stood at turn of the 20th century.||The considerable latter part of the text presents applications, worked problems, descriptions of the construction and use of optical instruments including microscopes, telescopes, and other practical applications of optics.||Editions appeared in 1887, 1895, and 1900. A German translation by  R. Kanthack appeared in 1894. Heath would abridge his text and remove advanced mathematics to produce <i>An Elementary Treatise on Geometrical Optics<i> in 1888.","Heath's treatise is in 13 Chapters. 1: Nature and Properties of Light. 2: Reflexion and Refraction of Rays of Light. 3: Reflexion and Refraction of Direct Pencils. 4: Elementary Theory of Refraction through Lenses. 5: Refraction through Lenses. 6: General Theorems. Caustics. 7: Aberration op Direct Pencils. 8: On the General Form and Properties of a Thin Pencil. General Refraction of Thin Pencils. 9: Dispersion and Achromatism. 10: The Eye and Vision through Lenses. 11: Optical Instruments. 12: Optical Instruments and Experiments. 13: Refraction through Media of Varying Density. Meteorological Optics.||Heath's treatment, especially in the initial theoretical chapters, is deeply mathematical, requiring a knowledge of calculus. The presentation order of the material reflects a sense of pedagogy and Heath's clear style is evidently informed by his teaching experience. An example of Heath's extensive use of mathematics is in Chapter 4 where he uses continued fractions to analyze place and size of images by refraction through any number of coaxial spherical surfaces. This is applied to the analysis of image formation by multiple, coaxial lenses.","A Treatise on Geometrical Optics (Book Review)|Larmor, J.|Nature, Vol 36, 7 July 1887, pp 291-220.||Generalized Meridional and Sagittal Formulas|Roe, E.D.|<i>Journal of the Optical Society of America<i>, Vol 8, No 3, pp. 461-470.",A Treatise on Geometrical Optics,,,1887,1875-1900,"English mathematician, professor at Mason College of the University of Birmingham, textbook author.",1,1887,,,Cambridge,University Press,,,,œÄ¬π‚Å∞ 1-22‚Å∏ 23¬≤,[ùüö] [i-v] vi [vii] viii-x [xi] xii-xvii [xviii] [1] 2-356,,,"Contemporary Blind Stamped Cloth, Spine Gilt",,220,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1887 Heath - A Treatise on Geometrical Optics - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,http://books.google.com/books?id=gnhLAAAAMAAJ,750,,52.1869,0.1305
Heinrich Hertz,"Hertz, Heinrich",,1857-1894," ",√úber sehr schnelle electrishche schwingungen,"Heinrich Hertz's announcement of the production, detection, and analysis of electro-magnetic waves.
","Before starting the experimental work that would make him famous, Heinrich Hertz had studied under Helmholtz's and knew the latter's generalized theory of electrodynamics. Popular on the continent, this purportedly subsumed the action-at-a-distance theories of Weber and Neumann and the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell. Helhmoltz had urged Hertz to study the problem of demonstrating whether electromagnetic waves existed; the Weber and Neumann theories did not predict their existence, Maxwell's did. Hertz began his experiments in 1886 while teaching at the Technische Kochschule at Karlsruhe. The instruments he perfected allowed him to generate and detect high-frequency electromagnetic waves, to investigate their nature, and to show them completely like the much shorter waves associated with light.||These first two papers appear in 1887. Their importance, indeed epochal nature, was recognized immediately by the British Maxwellians George FitzGerald, Oliver Lodge, and Oliver Heaviside. Hertz had demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves, the first physical evidence of the correctness of Maxwellian electromagnetic theory. Hertz's discovery was announced with great fanfare the 1888 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and Hertz's papers were quickly translated into English and appeared in British journals.||Hertz would produce a series of papers completely determining the properties of the waves demonstrating their velocity, reflection, refraction, focusing, and interference. These papers would be collected and, together with an introduction, appear as <i>Untersuchungen √ºber die Ausbreitung der Elektrischen Kraft<i> in 1891. An English translation of the collection, under the title <i>Electric Waves<i>, appeared at London and New York in 1893.","Hertz describes the apparatus he developed to produce electromagnetic waves. The long-understood difficulty had been to generate wave of sufficient frequency such that they had a wavelength of a size that made it possible to conduct experiments. Equally daunting has been the problem of detection. Hertz describes the modification of an existing combination spark-gap apparatus with induction coil, Leyden jar, and gap. Removing the capacitance of the Leyden jar increased the operating frequency significantly, and long wires leading to the gap became long-wavelength electromagnetic wave emitters. A remote, isolated moveable coil with a micrometer spark gap was placed in the radiated field would intercept the waves--acting as an antenna of sorts--inducing a current in the coil; the presence and size of the spark indicated the presence and size of the waves.||The second paper describes Hertz determination of the effect of ultra-violet light on the sensitivity of the spark-gap detector. When illuminated with ultra-violet light, the detector was more sensitive. There was no know explanation for this at time; only later would this be described as the photoelectric effect produced by light-electron interaction.","‚ÅÇ Pioneers of Electrical Communication part 5 - Heinrich Rudolph Hertz|Appleyard, R.|<i>Electrical Communication<i>, Vol 6, No 2, pp 63-77.||<i>The Maxwellians<i>|Hunt, B.J.|Cornell University Press, 1991, 266 pp, NB: pp 152-162.","√úber sehr schnelle electrische schwingungen WITH  Nachtrag zu der Abhandlung √ºber sehr schnelle electrische Schwingungen WITH √úber einen Einfluss des ultravioletten Lichtes auf die electrische Entladung. in: Annalen der Physik und Chemie 31, neue Folge, 1887, pp 421-448, 543-544, 983-1000.","On Very Fast Electric Oscillations With Addendum to the Treatise on Very Fast Electrical Oscillations WITH On the Influence of Ultraviolet light on the Electric Discharge.

It relies on and is to some extent patterned after Mascart's <i>Trait√© d'Optique<i> of 1889. The first half of Basset's treatise presents the optical phenomena and experimental data which must be explained by any theory of light, that last half presents and evaluates the theories that had been put forward, including Fresnel, Green, and Maxwell his followers. Basset was an applied mathematician and can be regarded as an agnostic with respect to the theories he presents, seeking only mathematical rigor and explanatory power, and treating the entire subject as mathematical physics.||The results of the Michelson-Morley experiment had appeared in 1887 but it would be nearly 20 years until the aether was finally abandoned and Basset takes its existence as a given. The book received a drubbing by reviewers in The Academy of London in July 1893 and The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science for August 1892. The Edinburgh reviewer objected to the mathematical nature of the book and the ""foolish process of writing down equations."" The Academy reviewer complained that Basset could not have been a teacher and book could not possibly be used as a textbook. The journal Nature, on the other hand, welcomed the book. The Edinburgh review, and Basset's response a month later, highlights the lingering dispute concerning the role of mathematics in physics, particularly in optics.","The treatise is in 20 Chapters. The first 10 present optical phenomena and data: Interference, colored fringes from thin and thick plates, diffraction, double refraction, colors from crystalline plates, polarization, and reflection and refraction. Though data and phenomena are presented, the experimental details are omitted, which adds to the clarity of presentation. Chapters 11-20 present theories of light involving dynamics and the nature of the luminiferous aether. The aether is presented as a scientific given, but with its properties unknown. Green's theory, proposed in 1837, on the dynamics of isotropic media is presented in detail, attempting to show the properties of the aether and how they account for observed optical phenomena. Rayleigh's and Thomson's theories of electrodynamics are presented, followed by the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell and his followers. The last chapter discusses magnetism and light, and presents optical phenomena that were only partially explained: The Faraday effect, Kerr's experiment, and the Hall effect.||The presentation is detailed, deeply mathematical, and those aspects involving the various theories are closely argued. Some of the early chapters end with worked examples.","Nineteenth-Century Aether Theories|Schaffner, K.F.|Peramon Press, Oxford, 1972, 277 p.",A Treatise on Physical Optics,,,1892,1875-1900,"English applied mathematician, textbook author in geometry, hydrodynamics, and optics.",1,1891,,"Deighton, Bell",Cambridge,,,,,[a]‚Å¥ b‚Å∏ 1-25‚Å∏ 26‚Å¥ 27¬≤,[i-v] vi-xxiii [xxiv] [1] 2-411 [ùüô],,,Contemporary Cloth Blind Stemped Spine Gilt,,215,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1892 Basset - A Treatise on Physical Optics - Images.JPG,Title Page,,,,,http://archive.org/details/atreatiseonphys00bassgoog/page/n7,758,Jeff Weber Rare Books,52.1869,0.1305

Hertz showed demonstrated the wave properties predicted by Maxwell‚Äôs theory of electromagnetism and that they had a velocity equal to that of light.
","Between 1886 and 1889, Heinrich Hertz conducted experiments to demonstrate the physical reality and properties of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves. Several papers reporting these experiments appeared in the Annalen der Physik und Chemie at that time. Though pressured by the publisher to produce simple reprints, Hertz decided that errors had to be corrected and additional commentary made, and so produced a corrected reprinting of 13 journal articles on his electromagnetic research, along with a long, preliminary overview and a concluding set of notes and corrections. As Hertz wrote, this reworking of his papers gave him 'the opportunity to acknowledge mistakes that had been made, to erroneously reject mistakes that had been attributed to me, and at the same time to have the opportunity to publicly answer a series of questions that have often been put to me orally or by letter.' In his work, Hertz showed that transverse free-space electromagnetic waves traveling at a finite speed, produced standing waves which showed the wave properties predicted by Maxwell‚Äôs theory of electromagnetism and had a velocity equal to that of light. Hertz also determined the electric field intensity, polarization and reflection of the waves and established that light and these waves were both a form of electromagnetic radiation obeying the Maxwell equations. An English translation appeared in 1893.

Siegfried Czapski,"Czapski, Siegfried",,1861-1907," ",Theorie der Optischen Instrumente,"A detailed, highly technical handbook of optical instrument design and practice. Based on the work of Ernst Abbe at the Zeiss optical works in Jena.
","Siegfried Czapski became assistant to Ernst Abbe at the Zeiss optical works in Jena in 1886. With the approval of the Zeiss brothers, Czapski became Abbe's most trusted assistant, working with Abbe on the many projects and developments at Zeiss. Czapski began work on an optical treatise in 1888, Abbe having neither time nor interest in writing up his theoretical and practical developments. Czapski's treatise appeared 5 years later in two forms: as a contribution to Adolf Winkelmann's <i>Handbuch der Physik<i> and as a separated publication. It was immediately recognized as a major work in technological and instrumentational optics.||Czapski states his purpose in writing the book in his Forward: 'to communicate that which, in my opinion, can not be found elsewhere more completely and coherently; to mention only what is essential, and for my special purpose, of what is necessary; and to offer merely a literature reference for the study of these fields of geometric optics. Czapski presents Abbe's theory of optical images in dioptric systems--which included the effects of diffraction--but states that he does not present Abbe's later general theory of diffraction since it would take too much and it was Abbe's intention to produce such a work himself. Abbe's theory of optical imaging revolutionized microscopy in the last 19th century.||A revised version of Czapski's book appeared in 1904 and again in 1924.","The book is in nine Sections. L Geometric optics, II. Geometric theory of optical imaging after Abbe. III. Realization of an optical image. IV. Spherical aberrations. V. Chromatic aberrations in dioptric systems and the theory of achromatism. VI. Prisms and prism systems. VII. The limitation of the rays and their dependent properties of the optical instruments. VIII. Main types of optical instruments including projection systems, microscopes, and telescopes. IX. Methods for the empirical determination of optical instrument constants.||Czapski presents Abbe's theory of optical images and its use in optical instrument design. This includes consideration of spherical and chromatic aberrations. These general results are then used to generate a particular theory of optical instruments which, in turn, is then applied to the principal types considered: the eye, projection system, magnifying glass, microscopes, and telescopes. In each of these instruments, the basic dioptric function is described and the factors on which it depends are characterized. These are the optical instrument constants considered in the last section of the book.","Ernst Abbe and the Foundation of Scientific Microscopes|Masters, B.R.|<i>Optics & Photonics News<i>, February 2007.",Theorie der Optischen Instrumente nach Abbe von Dr. Siegfried Czapski Wissenshaflichen Mitarbetier der optischen Werkstatte von Carl Zeiss in Jena,Theory of Optical Instruments after Abbe by Dr. Siegfried Czapski.

","In 1889 A.A. Michelson and E.W. Morely published their article 'On the feasibility of establishing a light-wave as the ultimate standard of length' in the American Journal of Science. Between 1890 and 1892 Michelson experimented with the interferometer developed for the Michelson-Morley experiment, seeking a way to use it to count the number of waves of light in the standard meter. It was necessary that the light source be stable, emit light of the narrowest possible wavelength spread, and be extremely coherent. Eventually, the red line emitted by cadmium vapor was found satisfactory and in 1892 Michelson succeeded in determining the length of the International Prototype Meter at the US National Bureau of Standards in terms of cadmium's red-line wavelength. The interferometer developed by Michelson for this work eventually became the standard instrument for measuring lengths and was adopted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The 1907 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Michelson 'for his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid.'
","Michelson's text is in 5 parts and six appendices. I: Introduction, II: Theory. III: Description of the apparatus. IV: Methods of observation.

Thomas Preston,"Preston, Thomas",,1860-1900," ",The Theory of Light,"Second, expanded edition of Thomas Preston's widely praised and used textbook for advanced students of the electromagnetic theory of light.","In his Preface, Preston makes clear his reason for writing his book on the theory of light: Most texts were too elementary regarding physical optics and the most current information was only available in difficult to access scientific journals. He wish to produce an complete, advanced text on physical optics for students British universities. The book is completely Maxwellian in its foundation and presents electromagnetism in service of explaining optical phenomena and providing a mathematical physics of light--that is, physical optics. All of this was written before the discovery of the electron and the large shift in Maxwellian theory which that discovery produced. Large sections of the book deal with aspects of polarization and interference effects and the only material in geometric optics is a brief section on the rainbow.||The first edition appeared in 1890 and this, the second edition, appeared in 1895. It was significantly augmented by Preston in sections dealing with the elementary phenomena of reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Posthumous edition appeared in 1901, edited by Preston's colleague Charles Joly, in 1912 edited by William Thrift, and 1928 edited by Alfred Porter. Preston's book was part of a remarkable series of textbooks published by Macmillan between 1890 and 1910. The book was widely used in physics courses in Great Britain until the 1930's. Many of the major names in physics at the time reviewed and praised the book: Thomson, Rayleigh, Fitzgerald, Wiedmann, Quincke, Poynting, and Michelson and later recalled with praise by Eddington.","The 21 Chapters of The Theory of Light present a complete, pre-electron electromagnetic theory of light. Chapters 1-6 present the elementary optical phenomena of propagation, reflection, refraction, and dispersion in terms of electromagnetism. Chapters 7-9 deal with interference and diffraction and Chapters 10-13 deal with polarization. Chapters 14-21 are somewhat more applied, covering application of polarization, instrumentation, measurements of properties, the velocity of light, and the rainbow.||The structure of the book reflects Preston's skill in ordering material and working out careful presentations, and is one of the reasons it was widely praised and widely used. The style is clear, detailed, and informed by history, with references to previous work throughout the text. Most sections that present theoretical material end with fully worked example problems that involve the theory. The mathematics required is presented in a matter-of-fact way that demands a complete knowledge of calculus.

","Paul Karl Ludwig Drude was asked by the publisher to produce an advanced, comprehensive textbook on optics, in the spirit of Mascart's <i>Trait√© D'Optique<i> of 1889. Drude agreed that a modern optics text was needed and even though, when the book was finished, he said 'I can make no claim to the completeness of the excellent textbook of Mascart . . .', his book was widely used, praised, and translated. Drude's text is a thorough introduction to physical optics in the mature and post-electron-discovery era of Maxwell‚Äôs theory of electromagnetism and sits on the cusp between it and the advent of quantum optics just five years later. In that regard, Drude describes the null result of Michelson's and Morley's experiment to detect the luminiferous aether in 1887 and he follows this with an explanation of the startling proposition of Lorentz and Fitzgerald that the length of a solid body may depend upon its absolute motion in space. Though Einstein‚Äôs suggestion of light quanta would eventually revolutionize physical optics, the mathematical power of the electromagnetic theory remained, and still remains, important in optics. Drude's book would not be superseded until Max Born's <i>Optik: Ein Lehrbuch der Elektromagnetischen Lichttheorie<i> of 1933. Editions of Drude's text appeared in 1900 and 1906, An English translation appeared in 1902, 1905, and 1907, and was reissued in 1917, 1922 and 1959, a French edition was published in 1911.
","Drude's optics textbook is in two parts, Geometric Optics (104 pages) and Physical Optics (395 pages). Drude leans heavily on Siegfried Czapski's <i>Theorie der Optischen Instrumente<i> of 1893 for his material on Geometrical Optics in five chapters. 1: Fundamental experiments and laws. 2: Geometric optical imaging. 3: Images by mirrors and lenses. 4: Vison, photometry, and images. 5: Optical instruments. The Physical Optics part is in three sections: General Properties of Light, Optical Properties of Bodies, Radiation from Bodies. General properties include: Propagation and speed, interference, Huygens principle, refraction, polarization. Optical Properties include the theory of light, transparent bodies, optical properties of crystals, absorbing bodies, dispersion, optically-active bodies, magnetically-active bodies, moving bodies. Radiation from bodies includes energy interpretation of radiation, thermodynamics applied to blackbody radiation, glow of gases. ","<i>The Theory of Optics, By Paul Drude.

Albert Abraham Michelson,"Michelson, Albert Abraham",,1852-1931," ",Light Waves and their Uses,A summary of how light itself was used as an instrument of science at the start of the 20th century.,"This is the third volume in a series published by the University of Chicago, commemorating first ten years of its existence. A. A. Michelson had given eight lectures given at the Lowell Institute in 1899, developed by Michelson specifically for a general audience. The lectures were accompanied by demonstrations, experiments, and 'lantern slides' to make the material accessible and engaging. In his preface to this printed version of the lectures, Michelson notes that he attempted 'to present the lectures as nearly as possible in the words in which they were originally given.' And so they retain an almost conversational tone. The purpose of the lectures was to present a summary of how light itself was being used as an instrument of science at the very end of the 19th century. The principal mechanism for this was the interferometer, a tool that Michaelson had developed and used in his famed Michelson-Morley experiment. The text is filled with figures and photographs of the experimental apparatus from the lectures. The sources of the material in the lectures were the many papers, technical and popular, that Michelson had published and part of the popularity of the lectures and the book was in the value of having brought all these different source to one place. The book was reprinted in 1907.","The book presents 8 lectures: 1 Interference; 2 Microscope, Telescope, and Interferometer; 3 Interferometer measurements of distance and angles; 4 Interferometry and spectroscopy; 5 Light waves as standards of length; 6 Interferometric measurement of magnetic effects on light; 7 Interferometric astronomy; 8 the Ether.  The first lecture starts with an elementary account of light waves, their properties, and the principle of interference and its consequences. The more familiar microscope and telescope are then evaluated with respect to resolving power and this leads to the interferometer and its resolving power. The following lectures present various applications of the interferometer, including heightened resolving power of telescopic measurements and the revealing of fine detail in spectroscopy. The last lecture presents the Michelson-Morely experiment and its attempt to detect the effect of the earth's motion through the luminiferous aether. Even then, it had become one of the most famous experiments to yield negative results.","Michelson and his interferometer|Shankland, R.S.|<i>Physics Today<i>, Vol 27, No 4, 1974, pp 37-43.",Light Waves and their Uses,,,1903,1900-1925,"Polish-born American physicist, astronomer, academic.

James Walker,"Walker, James",,1857-1929," ",The Analytical Theory of Light,"A complete, highly analytic presentation of physical optics based on wave theory, but without any reference to or assumptions regarding the luminiferous aether. Presaging the later vector-based treatment of physical optics.
","Walker makes clear the purpose of the book in his Preface: 'to give an account of physical optics without having recourse to any hypothesis respecting the nature of the influence that constitutes light or the character of the medium in which it is propagated.' In this sense it is almost entirely phenomenological--that is, an elaborate mathematical apparatus is erected to model clear experimental results--but not to form any underlying theory. It is based on and extends Fresnel's fundamental theory of transverse waves, frames the older theory in modern vector analysis, and makes no reliance on Maxwellian electromagnetic theory. In this sense it is quite unlike Paul Drude's <i>Lehrbuch der Optik<i> of 1900.||Walker sets aside considerations of a luminiferous aether, citing the contradictory properties it must exhibit depending on whether electrical or optical phenomena are considered, and that no suitable aether theory had been developed, whether corpuscular or of a continuum. The book presents an attractive (and uncommon) balance between analytic results and experimental facts. It was reviewed very favorably in the December 1905 issue of The London, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, in the January 1906 issue of Nature, and in the March 1906 issue of Science. Walker's text was widely read and recognized as the most complete treatment of analytical physical optics then extant. The analysis of the expressions he derived for modeling diffraction continue to be used and cited. Walker's heavy reliance of vector methods resulting in him citing Stokes's (then obscure) paper on the vector parameterization of polarized light. It was this reference in Walker's book that led Subrahamanyan Chandrasekhar to formulate his theory of atmospheric radiative transfer using the Stokes vector.
","Walker's text is in 19 chapters. 1: Geometrical Propositions of the Wave Theory. 2: Analytical Expressions for a Train of Plane Waves. 3; Interference. 4: Interference Produced by Isotropic Plates. 5: Differential Equations of the Polarisation Vector. 6: Huygens Principle. 7: Fraunhofer's Diffraction Phenomena. 8: Fresnel's Diffraction Phenomena. 9: More Accurate Investigation of the Problem of Diffraction. 10: Reflection and Refraction at the Surfaces of Isotropic Media. 11: Double Refraction. 12: Determination of the Principal Wave Velocities. 13: Crystalline Reflection and Refraction. 14: Interference of Polarised Light. 15: The Study of Polarised Light. 16: Absorbing Media. 17: Dispersion. 18: Structurally Active Media. 19: Magnetically Active Media.||Walker's initial analysis is in Chapter 1-4 and begins with experimental facts and a reasonable mathematical model is constructed from known properties of waves. Chapters 5-19 present the subsequent analytic theory. Wave analysis is made more general, analytically easier, and more concise by Walker's artifice of a 'Polarisation Vector' and another vector perpendicular to it. These are akin to the later conception of an Electric and Magnetic vector. Walker shows that a beam of unpolarized light can be represented by two beams of polarized light, having their polarization vectors perpendicular. Another artifice of Walker's is the introduction of exponentially diminishing wave amplitude to model absorption and dispersion.

Albert Einstein,"Einstein, Albert",,1879-1955," ","√úber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt ","One of the three papers Albert Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik in 1905, his famed <i>annus mirablis<i>. In it he advanced the 'heuristic' that light energy is carried in discrete quantized packets which he called light-quanta.
","One of the three papers Albert Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik in 1905, his famed annus mirabilis. Einstein dealt with the statistical/quantum nature of radiation and from this came his radical idea of light quanta which explained the inability of the electromagnetic theory of light to account for the so-called photoelectric effect: experiment showed that the energy of electrons emitted from a metallic surface struck by incident radiation depended not on its intensity, but rather on its frequency. Further, electromagnetic theory predicted a time lag in electron emission if the intensity of incident radiation was very low; which was also not observed experimentally. Einstein's paper advanced the hypothesis (he called it a 'heuristic') that light energy is carried in discrete quantized packets which he called light-quanta. He stated 'Energy, during the propagation of a ray of light, is not continuously distributed over steadily increasing spaces, but it consists of a finite number of energy quanta localized at points in space, moving without dividing and capable of being absorbed or generated only as entities.' Initial reactions to Einstein's idea were quite dim; indeed, in a reference letter for Einstein, Planck assured the recipient of Einstein's knowledge and ability and urged him not be prejudiced by his more fantastic ideas, such as light quanta. But in 1914, Millikan's Experiment supported Einstein's model of the photoelectric effect and Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 for 'his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.' In 1909, Einstein would propose the wave-particle duality for light in his paper 'Zum gegenw√§rtigen Stand des Strahlungsproblems' ('To the Recent State of Art of the Radiation Problem').
","First, Einstein calculated the change in entropy when a volume filled with blackbody radiation of some total energy in the high-frequency region of the spectrum was reduced to a smaller subvolume, The requirement of 'high frequency' was required so that he could use Wien‚Äôs radiation law. He then used Boltzmann‚Äôs statistical expression for the entropy to calculate the probability of finding some number, N, of independent, distinguishable gas molecules moving in the large volume at a given instant of time in a the subvolume. He found that these two results were formally identical, providing that the change in entropy was a function of the frequency of the radiation. And so he concluded: ‚ÄúMonochromatic radiation of low density (within the range of validity of Wien‚Äôs radiation formula) behaves thermodynamically as if it consisted of mutually independent energy quanta ...‚Äù He then cited three experimental results to support his idea, the most famous of which was the photoelectric effect, the others were Stokes Law for photoluminescence and the generation of cathode rays by illuminated solid bodies.","Einstein's Revolutionary Light-Quantum Hypothesis|Stuewer, R.H.|In: <i>American Physical Society, 36th Meeting of the Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics<i>, May 17-21, 2005||‚ÅÇ ùëª  http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/100","""√úber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt"" In: Annalen der Physik, Vol 17, 4th Series, pp 132-148.","""On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light""  In: Annalen der Physik, Vol 17, 4th Series, pp 132-148.",German,1905,1900-1925,Swiss physicist of preternatural imaginative power.,1,1905,Stamp of the Institut Catholique de Paris,House of Johann Abrosius Barth,Leipzig,,,,,œÄ‚Å¥ 1-12‚Å∏ 13¬≤ 14-24‚Å∏ 25‚Å¥ 26-65‚Å∏,[i-v] vi-viii [1] 2-1020,Plates [I-V] 1 folding,,Contemporary 1/2 Calf Over Marbled Paper Covered Boards,,210,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1905 Einstein - √úber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt  - Images.JPG,Title Page,F:/Bibliotheca Opticoria/Catalogue/BibliothecaOpticoria Images/Photo3rdDrafts/1905 Einstein - √úber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt  - Images 2.JPG,,,,http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuViewSB?url=http://content.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/mpiwg/online/permanent/einstein_exhibition/sources/HUN315QN/index.meta&mode=texttool,767,Librairie Alain Brieux,51.3419,12.3751
Karl Schwarzschild,"Schwarzschild, Karl",,1873-1916," ",Untersuchungen zur geometrischen Optik,"Three of Karl Schwarzschild's most important papers on the optics of reflecting telescopes.
","With these three papers, Karl Schwarzschild advanced the theory and practice of reflecting telescope design. By 1900 the technology of telescope mirror manufacture had produced the 60-inch reflector at the Mr. Wilson Observatory and the promise of even larger aperture telescopes underscored the inadequacy of current design theory and practice. Beginning with Seidel's third-order aberration theory, Schwarzschild extended this with his Eikonal developments. This theory was applied to reflecting telescopes of single or multiple optically active mirrors. This was followed with procedures to design astrographic objectives for telescopes. Schwarzschild's work has been used in the theoretical design of multiple-mirror huge aperture telescopes.
","Schwarzschild's work proved singularly important, particularly that in the second paper, in which he proved that a telescope using two aspheric mirrors could allow significant improvement in aberration correction, maintaining a wide field of view. More interesting and influential was his demonstration that a multi-mirror system could be designed that used a spherical primary mirror--rather than parabolic--something immeasurably simpler to design, manufacture, use, and maintain, since all of its segments would have the same figure.","‚ÅÇ Karl Schwarzschild and Telscope Optics|Wilson, R.N.|<i>Reviews in Modern Astronomy<i>, Vol 7, 1994, pp 1-30.","Untersuchungen zur geometrischen Optik.

A thorough introduction to geometric and physical optics in the mature and post-electron-discovery era of Maxwell‚Äôs theory of electromagnetism and sits on the cusp between it and the advent of quantum optics just five years later.
","Paul Karl Ludwig Drude was asked by the publisher to produce an advanced, comprehensive textbook on optics, in the spirit of Mascart's <i>Trait√© D'Optique<i> of 1889. Drude agreed that a modern optics text was needed and even though, when the book was finished, he said 'I can make no claim to the completeness of the excellent textbook of Mascart . . .', his book was widely used, praised, and translated. Drude's text is a thorough introduction to physical optics in the mature and post-electron-discovery era of Maxwell‚Äôs theory of electromagnetism and sits on the cusp between it and the advent of quantum optics just five years later. In that regard, Drude describes the null result of Michelson's and Morley's experiment to detect the luminiferous aether in 1887 and he follows this with an explanation of the startling proposition of Lorentz and Fitzgerald that the length of a solid body may depend upon its absolute motion in space. Though Einstein‚Äôs suggestion of light quanta would eventually revolutionize physical optics, the mathematical power of the electromagnetic theory remained, and still remains, important in optics. Drude's book would not be superseded until Max Born's <i>Optik: Ein Lehrbuch der Elektromagnetischen Lichttheorie<i> of 1933. Editions appeared in 1900 and 1906, An English translations appeared in 1902, 1905, and 1907, and reissued in 1917, 1922 and 1959, a French edition was published in 1911.
","Drude's optics textbook is in two parts, Geometric Optics (104 pages) and Physical Optics (395 pages). Drude leans heavily on Siegfried Czapski's <i>Theorie der Optischen Instrumente<i> of 1893 for his material on Geometrical Optics in five chapters. 1: Fundamental experiments and laws. 2: Geometric optical imaging. 3: Images by mirrors and lenses. 4: Vison, photometry, and images. 5: Optical instruments. The Physical Optics part is in three sections: General Properties of Light, Optical Properties of Bodies, Radiation from Bodies. General properties include: Propagation and speed, interference, Huygens principle, refraction, polarization. Optical Properties include the theory of light, transparent bodies, optical properties of crystals, absorbing bodies, dispersion, optically-active bodies, magnetically-active bodies, moving bodies. Radiation from bodies includes energy interpretation of radiation, thermodynamics applied to blackbody radiation, glow of gases. ","<i>The Theory of Optics, By Paul Drude.

Louis de Broglie,"de Broglie, Louis",,1892-1987," ",Procedings of the Solvay Conference of 1911,Papers presented by 18 leadings scientists from all over Europe at the first Solvay Conference held at Brussels in 1911. The cusp of the quantum age.,"Walther Nernst, German chemist and physicist, was the principal architect of the first Solvay Conference. Nernst knew Ernest Solvay, chemist, industrialist and philanthropist, and lover of science, and suggested to Solvay that he fund an international conference. Nernst's proposal was to invite a select group of physicists from around the world to an international conference devoted to debating the new theories of physics and attempting to reconcile molecular-kinetic theory with Planck and Einstein's quantum approaches to energy and radiation. Solvay agreed and the first international invited conference in the history of science was arranged. This would be the first of a series of 'Solvey Conferences.'||The conference is considered a turning point in science since its titular topic, radiation and the quantum, had begun to challenge and remove the underpinnings of classical physics. The proceedings  included papers (and extensive commentary on papers) by Einstein, Lorentz, Nernst, Jeans, Warburg, Rubens, Planck, Knudsen, Perrin, Onnes, Sommerfeld, Rutherford, Poincare, Curie and Langevin. The patronage provided by Solvay and the prestige provided by the chair, Hendrik Lorentz, was sufficient to bring together the leading physicists of the time for a week-long discussion on the 'Radiation Theory and Quanta,' or the quantum theory of radiation. This was Albert Einstein's first public appearance in the international community of physicists, and though the youngest attendee, was already sufficiently successful and confident so as not to be overawed by all the great names. He referred to the conference as 'the Witches' Sabbath in Brussels.' At its end, he would be recognized as the new, young leader of the profession of physics. The conference papers were provided in typescripts in French, English and German, derived from submissions by the participants. These were eventually published, with revisions, in this, the conference proceedings, edited by Langevin and de Broglie. A German edition of the proceedings, edited by Arnold Eucken, appeared in 1914.","The essential aspects of the conference papers and the discussion that surrounded them was the existence and nature of quanta. Classical physics has famously failed to produce a theory that resulted in an equation that correctly predicted the the energy distribution as a function of wavelength of a blackbody radiator--a radiation formula. H.A. Lorentz presented a thorough review of why classical physics fails to produce a realistic radiation formula. In the process he references (and supports) Einstein's work on the quantization of energy. Max Planck presented a summary of the work that had been done on explaining his own successful expression of a radiation formula he had produced 11 years earlier. As Einstein had proposed in 1906, the only reasonable assumption was that of energy quanta. The discussion of Planck's report was particularly extensive and highlighted the difficulties faced by physics at the time. Einstein's report was ostensibly on specific heats, but its scope was much broader. He linked the problem of specific heats to that of the radiation formula. Einstein's comments on this own report and that of Lorentz and Planck show him to be perhaps the only physicist present to fully understand the depth of the problem facing physics. He mentioned that it was then quite apparent that classical physics could not explain important physical phenomena in radiation and there was no complete quantum theory to replace it. The conference ended with a general debate, but no conclusions or, more importantly, no progress or agreement.","‚ÅÇ On the first Solvay Congress in 1911| Straumann, N.|<i>The European Physical Journal H<i>, Vol 36, No 3, 2011, pp 379‚Äì399.","La th√©orie du rayonnement et les quanta.
