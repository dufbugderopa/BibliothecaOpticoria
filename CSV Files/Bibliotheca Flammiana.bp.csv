Seventh edition (the first six were all incunables) and a rare and remarkable edition of the author’s chief work. The second edition to have the anatomical figures.  The Conciliator of Pietro d’Abano (1250–1315), who, as the title of the work implies, “tried to reconcile the views of the Arabists and Grecians, marks the rise of the rival school of Padua as a center of medical dialectics, of which Thaddeus and Peter were the patterns for a century… Peter’s Conciliator consists of 210 moot points to be resolved by dispute…which became the fashion for students’ dissertations and disputations even beyond the 17th century” (Garrison, p. 163). “Peter’s greatest and best-known work, the Conciliator, expresses his mediation between the humanistic Greek school, of which he was one of the very earliest forerunners, and the Arabists. It may be called the first product of medical humanism. From that work we learn that he came into contact with Marco Polo. Among the views expressed in the Conciliator that are most worth record may be mentioned the statements that air has weight, that the brain is the source of the nerves, that the heart is the source of both veins and arteries and that the nerves convey sensation and impulses of movement and are to be distinguished from tendons and ligaments — all ideas that were novel at his time. The work was very popular and influential in the northern Italian schools of the fifteenth century” (Charles Singer in the Fascicolo di Medicina). A striking feature of the present edition is the large anatomical woodcut representing two nude figures holding each other by their shoulders; at the abdomen the anatomy of the abdominal muscles is shown. This cut is copied from the one in the 1496 edition, one of the earliest graphic incunabula of anatomy. Abano is credited with performing the first autopsy/dissection in Padua. Besides the Conciliator, this edition contains the Tractatus de venenis, which was the first book on toxicology to be printed in 1472 (G&M 2070), and another tract on the same subject by Pietro Carario de Montefelice.

ff. I–XVIII","A series of lecture notes probably not intended for publication and published posthumously by Achillini's brother Giovanni Filoteo Achillini (1466-1538).. They record anatomical observations made in 1502, 1503, and 1506, and follow the outline of Mundinus’ text on which they are in fact a brief commentary. He quotes numerous authors and presents a broad view of the subject, avoiding certain dogmatic features of contemporary anatomy such as the doctrine of humours or pseudoscientific theories of astrology or physiognomy. He is credited with certain small discoveries or rediscoveries, as those of the fornix and infundibulum; his description of the brain is very good for that time. His work serves as an admirable short introduction to pre-Vesalian anatomy.  A second edition was published in Venice in 1521 and again in the 1522 edition of Ketham.  This may be the earliest medical book with a portrait of the author.

RCPE:  Achillini's 'Anatomical notes' were published posthumously by his brother, Giovanni Filoteo. The work seems to have been based on lecture notes, and in the preface Giovanni recommends the book to students. An early attempt to correct Galen's errors, Achillini is credited with discovery of  the fourth cranial nerve and of the hammer and stapes in the middle ear. He also gives an excellent description of the brain, and clearly describes the duodenum, ileum, and colon.

Alessandro Achillini (1463 – 1512) ‘is remembered for his considerable activity in
research on human anatomy. He gave a good description of the veins of the arm, and he described the seven bones of tarsus, the fornix of the brain, the cerebral ventricles, the infundibulum, and the trochlear nerve. He also described, exactly, the ducts of the submaxillary salivary glands—a discovery generally attributed to the Englishman Thomas Wharton (1614–1673)—and the ileocecal valve, described later by Costanzo Varolio and Gaspard Bauhin. Finally, to Achillini is attributed the first description of the two ossicles of the ear, the malleus and incus’ (DSB, I, 46).",17th century boards,220 x 160,"Achillini, Alessandro 1520-1.jpg","Achillini, Alessandro 1520-2.jpg","Achillini, Alessandro 1520-3.jpg","Achillini, Alessandro 1520-4.jpg",Roger Gaskell,B5

ff. [52]","Dated 31 May 1503 in the colophon.  Woodcut on f8r is a cartoon of the ventricles shown as circles with functions assigned to each. This is among the earliest woodcuts to assign function to areas of the brain, in this case, the ventricles.  It is preceded by Albertus Magnus from which the circles are derived.  Other early depictions of the ventricles include Ludovicus of Prussia 1498, Peyligk 1499, Magnus Hundt 1501, Versor's edition of Aristotle's De anima, 1501, and Reisch's Margarita Philosophica 1503 (before July 13th).   Clarke and Dewhurst discuss and illustrate these works.  The present illustration shows both memoria and motiva in the fourth ventricle.  The same wood block without the type in the circles appears on the title page of Berengario's Tractatus de fractura calve sive cranei of 1518.  NLM lists this under Augustino Trionfo (1243-1328).

Achillini was a famous teacher. While he was known as a philosopher during his own lifetime, Achillini is now mainly remembered for his achievements in medicine. ""He gave a good description of the veins of the arm, and he described the seven bones of tarsus, the fornix of the brain, the cerebral ventricles, the infundibulum and the trochlear nerve. He also described, exactly, the ducts of the submaxillary salivary glands - a discovery generally attributed to the Englishman Thomas Wharton (1614-1673) - and the ileocecal valve, described later by Costanzo Varolio and Gaspard Bauhin. Finally, to Achillini is attributed the first description of the two ossicles of the ear, the malleus and incus"" (DSB). 

ACHILLINI, ALESSANDRO (1463-1512), Italian philosopher, born 20 October 1463 at Bologna, was celebrated as a lecturer both in medicine and in philosophy at Bologna and Padua, and was styled the second Aristotle. His philosophical works were printed in one volume folio, at Venice, in 1508, and reprinted with considerable additions in 1545, 1551 and 1568. He was also distinguished as an anatomist among his writings being Corporis humani Anatomia (Venice, 1516-1524), and Anatomicae Annotationes (Bologna, 1520). He died at Bologna on 2 August 1512.

His brother, Giovanni Filoteo Achillini (1466-1533), was the author of Viridario and other writings, verse and prose, and his grandnephew, Claudio Achillini (1574-1640), was a lawyer

A Dominican friar, Albertus Magnus was Thomas Aquinas’s teacher and one of the most knowledgeable students of the Aristotelian corpus. De animalibus provides not only a practical compendium of Aristotle’s zoological works, but also numerous integrations arising from Albertus’s direct observation of nature.

 ""The year 1249 marked a turning point in the intellectual career of Albert the Great.  This was the year he finally acceded to the pleas of his Dominican confreres to compose a work explaining the natural science of Aristotle. The immediate product of this decision was Albert's paraphrastic commentary on the Physics, but there were long-term results as well. This work was but the first part of what was to become one of the major literary productions of the Middle Ages; a production which would establish Albert as, according to his envious contemporary Roger Bacon, an auctoritas on equal footing with Avicenna, Averroes, and Aristotle himself. Albert's project, intended to 'make the new learning of Aristotle intelligible to the Latins,' was largely concerned with the natural sciences. He not only commented extensively on all of Aristotle's libri naturales; but also recorded his own extensive researches in several fields. By far the largest part of this vast compilation of the sciences is that devoted to zoology. Albert’s massive De animalibus libri XXVI is not only the longest of his Aristotelian commentaries but also represents one of the most extensive records of empirical observation published before modern times.""

The best illustrated incunable edition of this renowned textbook of natural philosophy and psychology, which was used in schools throughout the Middle Ages. It first appeared in Toulouse about 1480. This edition by Giorgio Arrivabene comprised larger copies of the beautiful woodcuts published by Battista Farfengo in 1490 and 1493. The text, drawn from Farfengo’s publications, includes an excerpt on the twelve passions of the soul from De regimine principum by Giles of Rome (ff. giv-giiiv). The Philosophia pauperum (philosophy for simple folk) gathered extracts from writings of the scholastic thinker Albert the Great (c.1193-1280). His influential works and Aristotelian commentaries were often summed up by his students and confreres for the instruction of the less learned. In earlier manuscripts, the Philosophia is ascribed only to a ‘Brother Albert, O.P.’, while others mention an ‘Albert of Orlamünde’, a Dominican teacher in Thüringen. Its authorship remains debated. The work consists of an accessible adaption of the first four treatises by Aristotle (Physics, De Coelo, De generatione et corruptione, Meteorology) as well as of his De Anima. In this last part, the author’s interpretation is strongly influenced by Avicenna, especially with regard to the human soul. The ventricles and faculties of the brain are discussed according to the medieval Cell Doctrine of the nervous system, which envisaged the existence of the three cerebral sections hosting respectively common sense, reason and memory. Imagination is also said to play an important part in the cognitive process, if one is able to distinguish between real and false with reason. The impressive woodcut at f. evir provides a representation of a treble brain. This was the thurd independent printed image of the organ, after the two, slightly different and smaller, issued by Farfengo in 1490 and 1493.

ff. 66","With woodcut initial 'A', the first letter of the author's name, and large symbolic woodcut (115 x 95 mm) on title, depicting the position of the earth in the universe consisting of the four elements and protected by God, surrounded five symbolic emblems: scales, a human head with the numbers 1-10 underneath, a pair of compasses, a carpenter's square and a vase; woodcut printer's device at the end (f. 65r), full-page woodcut of a human head with three circular compartments ('Ventriculus I-III') representing three different of the brains (f. 46r), and 2 large woodcuts in the text of the spheres. (66) lvs., incl. last blank. Early sixteenth century edition of this popular treatise,with a woodcut of the ventricular man different from the earliest editions. In earlier manuscripts this Philosophy for the simple (Philosophia pauperum, first published in Brixen in 1490; later editions Brescia 1493, Venice 1496, Leipzig 1502 and 1505), as the work was sometimes also called, is ascribed only to a 'Brother Albert, O.P.'. Other manuscripts are more specific, mentioning an 'Albert of Orlamünde'. Scholars now believe that it was this Albert (fl. late 13th c.), a Dominican teacher in Thüringen, who compiled these digests, which summarize and explain Aristotle's ideas on physics, metaphysics, and mathematics. Three parts are dedicated to heaven and earth, the elements and meteorology, and another part describes the 'anima' in every detail: the soul and mind of the human being and the spirit of animals and plants, the five senses, the human intelligence to invent, judge, memorize and interpret, and emotions like sensibility, sensuality, desire, love, affection, and fear. Other aspects of the mind like fantasy, imagination, dreams, the will, and even the control of the limbs are treated as well. The work is a fine example of the way Aristotle was introduced to students and how Greek and Arab science were taught by Albertus Magnus at the universities. The work provides in fact a short textbook of natural philosophy and psychology which was used in schools throughout the Middle Ages. In the chapter about the soul (De anima) the author discusses the three ventricles of the brain as it is represented in the illustration on f. 46r: a diagram of the ventricles of the brain, sort of a 2D version of a phrenological model, with three perfect circles neatly packed into the brain case. Albertus Magnus was born sometime between 1193 and 1206, in Lauingen in Bavaria Contemporaries such as Roger Bacon applied the term 'Magnus' to Albertus during his own lifetime, referring to his immense reputation as a scholar and philosopher. Albertus was educated principally at Padua, where he received instruction in Aristotle's writings. In 1223 (or 1221) he became a member of the Dominican Order, against the wishes of his family, and studied theology at Bologna and elsewhere. Selected to fill the position of lecturer at Cologne, Germany, where the Dominicans had a house, he taught for several years there, at Regensburg, Freiburg, Strasbourg and Hildesheim. In 1245 he went to Paris, received his doctorate and taught for some time as a master of theology with great success. During this time Thomas Aquinas began to study under Albertus. Good copy, complete with the mostly lacking last blank, with a few contemporary annotations in ink in the margins and on verso of the last.

pp. 285, [3]","Woodcut printer's device on title, woodcut initials, and 2 woodcut illustrations of a splint and an orthopedic boot.  First edition of this treatise by Spain's most outstanding surgeon of the sixteenth century. This work on wounds of the head and other parts of the body was notable for improving the conditions, as well as educating and reforming the technique and ethics, of his profession. In treating wounds and physical deformities, the author provides information on fevers and various treatments for illnesses, including drug-related remedies. Arceo ""believed in healing by first intention, described an operative technique for removal of the breast for cancer, and discusses the treatment of talipes with a special shoe of his design"" (Leonardo). In addition, he describes a new rhinoplastic method and was the inventor of a special balm. Arceo (1493-1575) of Fregenal was so highly esteemed as a surgeon, that patients visited him from foreign countries. His name is preserved to us today in the balsamun Arcaei that he invented. Edited by Benedictus Arias Montanus (1527-1598) with annotations by Alvaro Nuñez.  

The English translation by John Read in 1588: A most excellent and compendious method of curing woundes in the head, and in other partes of the body, London, Thomas East contains the first printing of the Hippocratic Oath in English. The book was also translated into German and Dutch.

 Only Lier seems to have offered this first edition before this copy at Sotheby's in 2005.

Francisco de Arceo (1493-?1573), who studied medicine and surgery at Alcala and who was for a while physician attending surgical patients at the monastery-hospital at Guadalupe, was also one of the more distinguished surgeons of the 16th century. His one-time fellow student and continuing close friend the theologian, statesman, and philosopher Benito Arias Montania (1526-1611), who edited Arceo's principal surgical treatise published after his death, recorded in his preface that Arceo continued to perform successful operations into his 80s. He was particularly famed for his empyema operations, and patients came to him from all over Europe, even from France and England. The basic principles set forth in his De recta curandorum vulnerum ratione (Antwerp, 1574) were those of Pare: simplicity, cleanliness, and a proper humility on the part of the practitioner. He added a detailed dispensary to his work and developed a balm which was later called after him (balsamo de Arceo), and a method of rhinoplasty antedating that of Tagliacozzi. His major work, which was divided into two books, the first dealing with wounds and fractures of the head, and the second with wounds of the rest of the body and (briefly) with ulcers and syphilis, was translated into English as 'A most excellent and compendious method of curing woundes in the head', (trans. J Read, London, 1588), and reached German translations in 1600, 1674 and 1717, and a Dutch translation in 1667. Though his theoretical views were naturally based on Galen and Avicenna, he was responsible for simplification of treatment, improvements in dressings and instruments, and for such experiments as the treatment of malaria with sarsaparilla.",Contemporary limp vellum,160 x 100,"Arceo, Francisco [Arcaeus] 1574-1.jpg","Arceo, Francisco [Arcaeus] 1574-2.jpg","Arceo, Francisco [Arcaeus] 1574-3.jpg","Arceo, Francisco [Arcaeus] 1574-4.jpg",Rootenberg / NY Book Fair,A4

Fourth edition 12 September 1499. Earlier editions: 1480, 1492, 1497.  Pietro d'Argelata (d. 1423) was the most distinguished pupil of Guy de Chauliac, and the principal surgeon between Guy and Giovanni da Vigo. He was professor at Bologna, and his Cirurgia was first published in 1480, edited by Matthaeus Moretus. He “taught the dry treatment of wounds, but powdered them; was skilled in dentistry, used sutures and drainage-tubes in wounds, trephined the skull, incised the linea alba in post-mortem Caesarean section, and sometimes operated for hernia, stone, and fistula in ano” (Garrison). He recommended compressing bandages in chronic ulcers, did not sew up wounds of nerves, cauterised varicose veins, and accomplished the removal of teeth by medicine rather than by pulling them out.  The work contains a careful review of earlier literature with numerous references. The various chapters cover wounds in general and of particular parts, and ulcers in general and of particular parts. Other chapters on specific disorders include hernia and scabies, and parts of the body include the eyes, eats, teeth and gums, skin, nerves, spine, etc. It contains a post-mortem, carried out on the body of Pope Alexander V, who died suddenly and mysteriously in Bologna in 1410 (Long, p. 62).  The annotations in this copy range from a brief note or even a single word to much longer notes occupying a whole margin. They are most extensive in the chapters on wounds.

On f. 210 appears De divisione librorum Galieni by Gentilis de Fulgineo (ca. 1230-1310) which is the earliest printed bibliography of any medical writer and, according to Besterman, is preceded only by the 1467 bibliographies of St. Jerome and Gennadius Massiliensis (Verona, Boninus de Boninis, c. 1475-1483) [Goff P-298; see 2001 Countway Library exhibit of incunables]. Early use of running titles, signatures, a register and foliation in Arabic numerals.  Second printing of the Articella, the first to contain the Oath and to be dated.

Perhaps one of the earliest books printed with a register without catchwords. See Haebler p. 58 where he attributes this to Lichtenstein in his Catholicon dated 24 September 1483, six months later than the Articella.

Theodorus Gaza's translation of Aristotle's three main zoological works: De historia animalium, De partibus animalium and De generatione animalium. They were the first collection of treatises on biology to be printed when the first edition appeared at Venice in 1476, and none of these texts were included in the Opera until the Aldine Greek edition of 1495-1498. ""Historia Animalium is an immense collection of biological data - anatomical, physiological, behavioral - on over 500 species of animals. Aristotle's interest lay in identifying and classifying groups of animals and in explaining their functioning as a part of nature, and it was the data reported in Historia animalium, that provided the basis for his philosophical analyses of relationships between structure, function and purpose. In De partibus animalium he explored these ""links of causation"" in the various groups of animals. In De generatione animalium he dealt with the principles of animal generation, including organs and secretions, gave a detailed account of generation in the different groups of animals, answered various questions connected with generation, and finally gave an explanation of development after birth and the differences between individuals of the same species"" (Grolier, Medicine 2A).

ff. [10], 317","§ Bound with Celsus 1497.  Two medicine treatises, bound together by Dr. Hector Pomer, a prior from Nuremberg during the Reformation, with his bookplate, attributed to Albrecht Durer or his disciple Sebald Beham (1500 – 1550), in a contemporary binding with a recorded price and date of the binding in 1525 on the rear pastedown. 

Vilanovanus (c. 1240–1311) was a Spanish doctor, theologian and alchemist, possibly born in Catalonia (perhaps Lerida) as Menedez Pelayo asserts, or Valencia clericus valentinae diocesis. His medical studies were in Montpellier until 1260, before going to Naples and Salerno, where he apparently studied under Arab and Jewish doctors, including Raimundo Marti.  He became personal physician Pedro III and James II of Aragon; While on a diplomatic mission to Philip IV of France, he presented his De adventu Antichristi, a work that would gain him enemies and censorship, and eventually imprisonment. 

On the front pastedown is a fine large woodcut depicting a full-length figure of Saint Lawrence, traditionally attributed to Albrecht Durer (who is known to have made several plates destined for bookplates), with modern scholarship also giving it as possibly his disciple Sebald Beham (National Gallery, Rosenwald Collection). It is one of the earliest known bookplates, with earlier examples dating to c.1480, for books of the Carthusian monastery of Bruxheim; other examples of German artists who produced bookplates are Cranach, Holbein, Solis, and Amman, later in the 16th century. The bookplate was made for Dr. Hector Pömer (1495-1541), featuring St. Lawrence –reflecting Pomer became provost of the Nuremberg parish of St. Lorenz in 1520-, and a escutcheon “with the Pömer arms and the gridiron of St Laurence, with crest, helm and mantling. Placed under an arch, St. Laurence standing on the left. In the four corners small escutcheons with the arms of Pömer, Rummel, Schmiedmaier and Bergmeister.” (British Museum, 1895,0122.748, acquired in 1895). The motto at the bottom of the plate is in Hebrew, Greek and Latin. Omnia munda mundis ""to the pure [men], all things [are] pure"" The binding was commissioned by Pömer -the acquisition recorded in the binding-, for which he paid '84d.' on 23 July 1525. There are handwritten notes on both works, however those of Vilanovanus are somewhat cropped by the binder.","Contemporary blindstamped calf, brass corners and catches",312 x 215; overall 323 x 225 x 78,Arnaldus of Villanova1509-1.jpg,Arnaldus of Villanova1509-2.jpg,Arnaldus of Villanova1509-3.jpg,Arnaldus of Villanova1509-4.jpg,HS Rare Books (Sebastian Hidalgo Sola) +54 911 5512 7770,B1

On the incipit page, the running title includes Nicolaus Jenson Galicus, thus making this an early example of a proto-titlepage.

Sixth overall  and second Venetian edition.  The present edition was issued a few months after Sixtus IV conferred upon the Frenchman the title of Count Palatine (announced in a letter printed at the end of the Decretales of March 1475). Following a three-year lull provoked by the crisis in the book trade, Jenson's press resumed the steady pace of the first two years of its activity, producing a total of 13 known editions. Variant settings are known of 1/2r, line 1 and for the colophon: this copy corresponds in both to the main entries of GW and BMC.

Loosely inserted is a tailor’s bill addressed to one Mychell Constable by Thomas Clarke, dated January 1624.

Augustine's De Civitate Dei appeared in print for the first time in 1467 at Subiaco, printed by Conradus Sweynheym and Arnoldus Pannartz. The first Venetian edition of the City of God was printed by Johannes and Vindelinus de Spira in 1470. This second Venetian edition is the only edition of Augustine issued by French printer Nicolas Jenson (1420-1480), the second printer in Venice, whose publications numbered over 100 works and equaled the best, and often surpassed, all Venetian fifteenth-century printed books in beauty and importance.

Jenson's types, the often-magnificent impressions, and the mise-en-page of his books, are considered milestones in the history of printing; his very name is synonymous with excellence. Along with his Pliny of 1472 and his Plutarch's Lives of 1478, the City of God is one of Jenson's most beautiful works. The present text is buttressed by wide margins, and entirely rubricated by hand in red and blue.

A seminal Christian text, Augustine's City of God had considerable influence not only on Medieval but also Renaissance thought. Augustine has been called ""the first medieval man and the last classical man"" (Thomas Cahill, How The Irish saved Civilization, chapter 2). Martin Luther, John Calvin, Thomas Aquinas, Emperor Charlemagne, Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and many other theologians and philosophers were inspired by this work. Like the Bible, the City of God has been a major topic of debate for theologians, historians, politicians, and philosophers throughout the ages.

An attractive, wide-margined copy of a great early printed text, here present in its second Nuremberg edition. The ""Catholicon"" was the first dictionary to be printed, and is the first printed text of any work in the field of secular knowledge: an encyclopaedic compendium, dealing with orthography, prosody, grammar, rhetoric, and etymology. A great number of manuscripts extant testify to the work's popularity right from the beginning. It was compiled around 1286 by Johannes Balbus, a Dominican from Genoa (died about 1298), and consist of five parts; the first four parts are text books of grammar and rhetoric; the fifth part is an encyclopaedia-dictionary comprising more than 14,000 entries covering all fields of knowlege. The name of the work, ""Catholicon"" indicates that its scope was intended to be universal. During the 14th and 15th centuries, it was used frequently for the instruction of the Latin language to lay people. A copy of the first edition (Mainz, Johannes Gutenberg, 1460) was part of the books collected by Christopher Columbus (today Madrid, BN I/1298-99). Balbus relied on older sources such as Isidorus of Seville, Papias and Huguccio. - Ungainly stain at upper inner corner at the beginning, especially the first leaf, repair to lower outer corner of leaf z6, 12 leaves somewhat shorter at lower edge, a few minimal flaws, some neat ms. marginalia (?Becker), some underlinings in red or blue, rubrication stops at leaf cc. 

Balbus, a Dominican friar from Genoa, completed this work in 1286. It contains treatises on orthography, etymology, grammar, prosody, and rhetoric, but is best known for its etymological dictionary of the Latin language, which occupies the greater part of the text. This was apparently the first lexicographical work to achieve complete alphabetization from the first to the last letter of each word. It remained the standard Latin dictionary into the sixteenth century. Many manuscripts survive, and there were no fewer than 24 incunable editions. The first edition, sometimes attributed to Johann Gutenberg and extant in three issues, was printed by a revolutionary technique using two-line “stereotyped” slugs, but the subsequent editions were printed using moveable type in the standard manner. The printed of this edition, known as the R-printer, so named from the “bizarre” shape of the capital R that appears in his works, is now considered to have been Adolf Rusch von Ingweiler. Rusch printed in Strasbourg in the 1460s and 1470s, often in collaboration with Johann Mentelin, the first printer in Strasbourg, whose daughter he married.","Contemproary blind-stamped calf over wooden boards with clasps, rebacked",410 x 275,"Balbus, Johannes (Giovanni Francesco Balbi or Johannes Januensis1486-1.jpg","Balbus, Johannes (Giovanni Francesco Balbi or Johannes Januensis1486-2.jpg","Balbus, Johannes (Giovanni Francesco Balbi or Johannes Januensis1486-3.jpg","Balbus, Johannes (Giovanni Francesco Balbi or Johannes Januensis1486-4.jpg",Christie's /Nigel Phillips,B7

Of course Trithemius' Catalogus illustrium viro[rum] germania[m] (1495) might also be considered to be a national bibliography. A later printing of the Summarium exists, dated 1549. The book follows the arrangement of Trithemius.  It was based in part by a 1545 manuscript of John Leland.  Title page woodcut shows Bale presenting the book to Edward VI.  John Bale was the Bishop of Ossory, converted to Protestantism and returned to England only after the accession of Edward VI. His autobiography appears on ff. 242-246.  Preliminary quires wormed, title wormed and mounted.  Some errors in foliation may indicate early states.  This copy has l. 248 for l. 251.  Other copies have l. 251 for l. 249.  Breslauer and Morgan copies are in bindings of Thomas Wotton.  The Grolier Club owns Edward VI's dedication copy of this book, which was exhibited by Breslauer and Folter at the Club in 1981.  Bale undertook his antiquarian project to preserve and catalogue the manuscript holdings of those libraries threatened by the dissolution of the monasteries. He often remarked that 'to destroye all without consyderacyon, is and wyll be unto Englande for ever, a moste horryble infamy amonge the grave senyours of other nacyons' 

DNB: Bale was a man of great theological and historical learning, and of an active mind. But he was a coarse and bitter controversialist and awakened equal bitterness amongst his opponents. None of the writers of the reformation time in England equaled Bale in acerbity. He was known as ‘Bilious Bale.’ His controversial spirit was a hindrance to his learning, as he was led away by his prejudices into frequent misstatements. The most important work of Bale was a history of English literature, which first appeared in 1548 under the title ‘Illustrium Majoris Britanniæ Scriptorum Summarium in quinque centurias divisum.’ It is a valuable catalogue of the writings of the authors of Great Britain chronologically arranged. Bale's second exile gave him time to carry on his work till his own day, and two editions were issued in Basel, 1557-1559. This work owes much to the ‘Collectanea’ and ‘Commentarii’ of John Leland, and is disfigured by misrepresentations and inaccuracies. Still its learning is considerable, and it deserves independent consideration, as it was founded on an examination of manuscripts in monastic libraries, many of which have since been lost.

DNB: Banister or Banester, John 1540-1610, surgeon, was well known among surgeons in London in the latter half of Queen Elizabeth's reign. He began his professional life as surgeon to the forces sent under the Earl of Warwick in 1563 to relieve Havre. On this expedition he and William Clowes [q.v.], another surgical author, began a friendship which lasted throughout their lives. Some time after his return he studied at Oxford, and received a license to practise in 1573. For several years he practised both physic and surgery at Nottingham. Leicester's expedition to the Low Countries in 1585 gave Banister another opportunity of public service, and he served on board ship (Royal Letter, 1593; see Munk). After the expedition he settled in London, and in 1588 he and Clowes are associated in the dedication of Read's ‘Translation of Arceus.’ They saw many cases together, and in 1591 T. P., a patient of theirs, praised both surgeons in a wretched English poem. Complaints were often made at that time to the College of Physicians as to surgeons practising medicine, and, perhaps in consequence of some such difficulty, Banister in 1593 obtained a royal letter of recommendation which led the college to grant him a license (15 Feb. 1593-4) on the condition that in dangerous cases he should call in one of its fellows.

This is now considered to be the second edition after the Cologne edition of 1471. The De proprietatibus rerum was first printed in Cologne by Johann Schilling for William Caxton in about 1471. There were twenty-four editions (in Latin, Dutch, French, English, and Spanish), printed in the fifteenth century. This is the first important encyclopedia written in the Middle Ages and the first to include the works of Greek, Arabian and Jewish naturalists and medical writers. For three hundred years it defined the general knowledge the Latin literate need master. Its nineteen books cover anatomy, musical instruments, astronomy, plants, food, political geography, insects, wine, glass, medicine, form, matter, animals, meteorology, minerals, metals, venom, how to give a dinner party…. Ruppel learned to print with Gutenberg and introduced printing to Basel and Switzerland. None of his sixteen books is dated.

In good condition (final upper margins and first leaves are lightly stained — one quire more so), a large copy with pinholes preserved, a few margins uncut. 

A journeyman of Johannes Gutenberg's called Bechtold of Hanauwe [1] and Berthold Ruppel were probably the same person. As Berthold early as 1468 a Latin Bible ( GW -printed 4207) in Basel, it is believed that he had introduced the printing press there. In the following years Ruppel printed  about 20 to 28 more works that are mainly devoted to theology and canon law. By 1475 Berthold Ruppel was married to a Magdalena, with her ​​he had a daughter. In 1477 Berthold acquired the freedom of the city.  Ruppel was last mentioned as alive on 4 March 1494.. On 12 March 1495 his wife was referred as a widow.  Ulrich Zel was also from Hanau.

Bartholomeus' encyclopedia of mediaeval knowledge, written for the common people, was highly popular and successful (this is its eighth edition, the first by Anton Koberger [ca. 1440–1513]). The first edition appeared in 1470. It treats natural history, geography, medicine, cosmology, meteorology, medicine, music, etc. ","Colophon: [Nuremberg] : Impressus per industriosum viru[m] Anthoniu[m] Koburger inclite Nurenberge ciue[m], anno Salutis gratie M.CCCClxxxiij, iij. Kal[enda]s Iunij. [30 May 1483]. Partially rubricated.

First editions Caxton 1472, ca. 1471 or 1479 [Basel. Berthold Ruppel]; First dated edition 1480. Strasbourg.

The first important encyclopedia of all the sciences of the Middle Ages, which by its wide dissemination over three centuries, had a profound influence on medieval thought. It is ""still important for its information on political geography and its accounts of natural history"" (Stillwell). Divided into nineteen books, the contents are as follows: ""(1) God; (2) angels and demons; (3) psychology; (4–5) physiology; (6) family life, domestic economy; (7) medicine; (8) cosmology, astrology; (9) time divisions; (10) form and matter, elements; (11) air, meteorology; (12) flying creatures; (13) waters and fishes, dolphins, whales; (14) physical geography; (15) political geography, (in 175 chapters; this contains a number of interesting remarks, notes on economic geography, etc.); (16) gems, minerals, metals; (17) trees and herbs; (18) animals; (19) color, odor, savor; food and drink, eggs; weights and measures; musical instruments"" (Sarton, II, p. 586). ""Book 16 contains 104 short chapters on as many mineral substances as earths, stone, ores, metals, salts, etc., as well as gemstones, the latter often given names that now defy identification of the materials concerned. Gemstones are alabaster, adamante, amethyst, agate, alabandina, beryl, carbuncle, chrysoprase, chalcedony, chrysolite, rock crystal, coral carnelian, hematite, heliotrope, jet, jasper, hyacinth, pearl, marble, onyx, opal, prase, sapphire, emerald, sard, sardonyx, topaz, turquoise; very brief descriptions with comments on curious or medicinal lore associated with each"" (Sinkankas, Gemology, p. 70).The first English edition was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1495.  The next English edition was by Berthelet in 1535.  Both editions were the translation of John Trevisa.

This is the second illustrated edition of Bartholomaeus’s work, preceded only by the French printing of Matthias Huss in Lyon (1482). The eleven full-page woodcuts in our book are original to this edition and independent from the French cuts. They are famous for the naturalistic liveliness, especially the plates of Books XII-XVIII showing birds, fish, plants and animals. A remarkably lifelike elephant even suggests he might have been studied by nature. The illustrations also include one of the earliest pure landscapes in printing (see Snyder, p. 55 and 59). At the end is Bellaert’s woodcut device within a four-piece floriated woodcut border with animals and birds (Juchhoff 37).  This is the only work printed bt Bellaert in which his name appears.  He prinyed from 1483 to 1486.
The illustrations – including the device – are attributed to Conway’s ‘Haarlem Woodcutter’, who is also called the ‘Bellaert Master’, as his works appeared at first in printings of Jacob Bellaert. After Bellaert ceased to operate his press in 1486, the master worked for Gerard Leeu in Antwerp. He is considered one of the best woodcut designers of the late 15th-century Netherlands, and, due to his painterly style, he has been connected to the workshops of panel painters as the Master of the Tiburtine Sibyl (cf. W.R. Valentiner, in: The Art Quarterly VI (1943), p. 74/91) or the Monogrammist AM (cf. Vroege Hollanders. Schilderkunst van de late middeleeuwen, exhib. cat. Rotterdam 2008, p. 126)

Jacob Bellaert (born in Zierikzee) was an early Dutch publisher who produced seventeen books in Haarlem from 1483 to 1486. The early Netherlandish painter Master of Bellaert or Master of Jacob Bellaert is so called for his many woodcuts in Bellaert's publications.","BSPS, plates colored",249 x 185,Bartholomaeus Anglicus1485-1.jpg,Bartholomaeus Anglicus1485-2.jpg,Bartholomaeus Anglicus1485-3.jpg,Bartholomaeus Anglicus1485-4.jpg,Romantic Agony,B5

Decorated with rolls of frames with portraits, inscriptions and ornaments; letters PEGAW on center panel of front cover.    Like Tagliacozzi, Bartisch produced one of the 16th century  works that established a surgical subspecialty.  Like other German surgeons such as Brunschwig, Gersdorff & Stromayr, Bartisch wrote in German and illustrated his book with actual cases.  A large part of its success is due to the many full page woodcuts that show not only the specific surgical procedures and instruments but also the style of dress of patients and surgeons and the conduct of surgical procedures.  Many of the plates appear to be individual portraits.  The woodcuts are by Hans Hewamaul after Bartisch's own drawings.  The use of superimposed flaps began with the fugitive leaves of Jobst de Negker, Hans Guldenmund, Heinrich Vogtherr and Gianantonio de Nicolinis de Sabio.  These all were based on pre-Vesalian anatomy.  Vesalius provided instructions for cutting out illustrations and superimposing them as flaps.  Leonhard Thurneisser in 1576 used a number of anatomical plates with super- imposed flaps for which Hewamaul also cut the woodblocks. Bartisch gives the first illustration of the brain and eye with superimposed  flaps.  Colored copies exist in Putti Collection, Duke University, Karolinska and the State Library of Dresden as well as the copy Mickey Carton bought from Jörn Günther.  The first three have identical coloring.  Günther offered a colored copy at NY Book Fair 2009 for $350,000 (to Micky Carton).  All copies seem to have similar coloration.  A second issue with a new title page was published in 1584.

The only artist that Belon mentions in his letter to the reader is Pierre Goudet (Gourdelle).  Firmin-Didot 4: 221b suggests that the initial letters are by Jean Cousin. Belon's comparison of the skeleton of a bird with that of a human in Book 1 establishes him as the originator of comparative anatomy.  The work is divided into seven parts: the first on the anatomy and physiology of birds; the second on birds of prey; the third on swimming birds; the fourth on coastal birds; the fifth on galliformes; the sixth on crows and similar species; and the seventh on songbirds. The second part also includes a chapter on falconry.  All seven books have separate title pages with the printer's device colored  The work is dedicated to Henry [sic] II.  The edition was published by Gilles Corrozet and Guillaume Cavellat; copies have either imprint and printer's device on title pages. Norman Catalogue shows both issues on p. 64.

The first and only old edition of this highly important ornithological work. It is the first French ornithology book. The cost of publishing this first edition was shared by two Parisian publishers: Guillaume Cavellet and Gilles Corrozet who had the book printed by Benoist Prevost. There are therefore two issues of this first edition, but with neither taking precedence: the present copy was published by Cavellat. 
Pierre Belon du Mans (ca. 1518-1564) studied medicine in Paris, where he took the degree of doctor before becoming a pupil of the brilliant botanist Valerius Cordus at Wittenberg, with whom he travelled throughout Germany. Cordus died of malaria in Italy in 1544, and Belon, on his return to France, came under the patronage of François, Cardinal de Tournon. De Tournon provided him with the means which allowed Belon in 1546 to undertake a wide ranging journey, apparently of scientific intent. He travelled through Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, Arabia and Palestine, returning to Paris in 1549, where a full account of the journey was published in 1553. Besides the narrative of his travels he wrote several scientific works of considerable value. Belon was highly favoured both by King Henry II and Charles IX. 
Perhaps taking his working methods from his former mentor Cordus, Belon published the Histoire naturelle des estranges poissons in 1551, followed by De arboribus coniferis and De aquatilibus in 1553, and then the present work in 1555. In this work Belon attempted to match the names of birds used by Aristotle and Pliny with those then current in France; he was also one of the pioneers of comparative anatomy, illustrating and describing the homologies of human and avian skeletons, and re-grouping birds according to their anatomy in the following books: (2) 'La nature des oyseaux vivants de rapine, tant de iour que de nuict'; (3) 'La nature des oyseaux vivants le long des rivieres, ayants le pied plat, nommez en latin Palmipedes aues'; (4) 'La nature des oyseaux de riviere, qui n'ont le pied plat'; (5) 'La nature des oyseaux de campagne, qui font leurs nids sur terre'; (6) 'La nature des oyseaux qui habitent indifferemment en touts lieux, & se paissent de toutes sortes de viandes'; and (7) 'La nature des oysillons, qui hantent les hayes, buschettes, & buissons'.
L'Histoire de la nature des oyseaux was also one of the first ornithological compendiums to be based, at least in part, on field observations, and it is also clear that many of the woodcut bird portraits were taken from actual specimens. Belon acknowledges the work of Pierre Goudet (= Gourdel(le) in the preface, but evidently a number of other artists cut the blocks: the cuts are variously signed with an arrow, a Lorraine cross, or a white cross in a black lozenge; the remainder are unsigned. Jean-Pierre Mariette confirms in his Abecedario (p. 324, de Nobele editeur) that Pierre Gourdel(le) (1530-after 1588) has drawn almost all the birds. Many of the original drawings were auctioned in June 2006 by Bergé in Paris.
On the verso of the title is the portrait of Belon with a quotation and sonnet by Guillaume Aubert (1534-1597), directed to King Henry II of France to whom the book is dedicated by Belon (pp. 3-4), dated Paris, 'en l'Abbaye S. Germain', 12 January 1554. After the preface on pp. 5-7, follow the contents (pp. 8-12), Index (pp. 13-25), the privilege, dated 14 January 1554 (p. 26-27), and laudatory poems by Nicolas Denisot (1515-59), Jean Vezou and Desiré Jaquot de Vandoeuvre.

Along with Estienne and Paré, Belon presented scientific work in French.  This work is preceded by Belon's L'histoire naturelle des estranges poissons marins...Paris: 1551 which is a quarto of 58 leaves.  It is this work that marks the revival of research into animal and comparative anatomy.  The first French edition of this work by the famous French naturalist Pierre Belon (1517-1564), printed by Charles Estienne (1504-1564), son of Henri I and brother of Robert Estienne.  Charles became  ""imprimeur du Roi"" in 1551. The work contains descriptions of a dolphin, a seal, a salamander, a turtle, a seahorse, all sorts of fishes, shells, etc., and it is illustrated with beautiful woodcuts, depicting also some imaginary animals.  For the present work, the author was probably inspired by the animals he saw on his journey from 1546 to 1550 to Greece, the Greek Islands, Alexandria, Lower Egypt, Judea, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, and back to Rome. The fish he describes include some rare species from the Mediterranean area. The Latin edition was published by Estienne in 1553.  The work was republished in Zurich in 1558.  According to Bayle & Thillaye, Belon was murdered because of Protestant beliefs.

ff. [8], 80, [12]","In the present work, his last one, Belon lists a large number of exotic trees useful to be introduced into France, inviting the College of Medicine in Paris to constitute a garden for the acclimatization of exotic plants. The bishop of Le Mans, René du Bellay, immediately adopted Belon's ideas for his gardens at Tourvoye.  Pierre Richer de Belleval, inspired by Belon, established the Jardin des Plantes at Montpellier in 1593, even before Paris had one. Charles de l'Escluse (Carolus Clusius) recognized Belon's authority in natural history. Clusius translated this work into Latin in 1589 to make it available to those unable to read French. Like most of Belon's books, this was published by Cavellat and Corrozet; there are copies with each imprint. The woodcut portrait of Belon at age 36 had already appeared in Belon's L'Histoire de la Nature des Oyseaux, 1555.  It is attributed to Geoffroy Tory by Auguste Bernard in his work on Tory (1865).  The title page is signed by Gesner: C. Gesnerii ex dono authoris, a very plausible presentation copy.   Belon stayed with Gesner in 1557 while working on Historia Animalium liber iiii (de Piscium). Belon contributed greatly to the progress of natural sciences in the sixteenth century and was the originator of comparative anatomy. In La nature et diversité des poissons, Paris 1551, he presented an orderly classification of fish. He set forth the first notions of embryology, and also classified birds. Belon's knowledge was not derived solely from books; he was one of the first explorer-naturalists. Between 1546 and 1550 he undertook long journeys through Greece, Asia, Judaea, Egypt, Arabia, and other foreign countries. Belon was very interested in the plants and trees he observed during his voyages, especially in their practical use, more than in their scientific description. According to Bayle & Thillaye, Belon was murdered because of Protestant leanings. The title page is mounted on a stub.  The washing of the book has eliminated the annotations, presumably by Gesner.

Recorded here are the results of twenty postmortems and hundreds of unusual cases describing gallstones, urinary calculi, cancer of the stomach, fibrous tumor of the heart, peritonitis arising from intestinal perforation, and Siamese twins. Benivieni was also the first to observe and describes here the superficial manifestations of syphilis and its transmission to the foetus. There are several important sections treating pathology in his descriptions of surgical procedures; therefore, this work is as valuable to the history of surgery as it is for early pathology.  While not as detailed as dissections by Morgagni, it is one of the earliest attempts to reach conclusions from direct observations. 
Benivieni (1443-1502) was an eminent Renaissance physician and surgeon to the most important families in Florence, a few of which include Machiavelli, Poliziano, Ficino, Lorenzo de' Medici, and his friend Leonardo da Vinci. His original conception of De abditis (on the several hidden and strange causes of disease and cure) was a work of 300 cases; unfortunately he only lived to complete one hundred sixty of these. His brother Girolamo, with the help of physician Giovanni Rosati, edited and had the work printed containing the one hundred eleven parts as it is seen here.  The work is noted in Poccianti, Gallus and Spach.  Malgaigne has a section on Benivieni in the introduction to Paré. 1: cxii-cxx.

""Antonio Benivieni was a friend and colleague of several of his distinguished contemporaries, including Angelo Poliziano, Marsilio Ficino, Benedetto Varchi, and Lorenzo de'Medici; during his thirty years of medical practice he attended the most important families in Florence. However, his fame today rests on the posthumous De abditis, edited by his brother, the poet Girolamo Benivieni, and the physician Giovanni Rosati. The title of the book, which translates as 'on the several hidden and strange causes of disease and cure,' reflects the author's interest in ascertaining, via postmortem examination, the reasons for death in cases where diagnosis during life had been obscured... De abditis was derived from the large number of manuscript records that Benivieni left behind him at his death. The work was originally conceived as a treatise of 300 sections to be published in three series or centuriae; however, Benivieni completed only 160 sections, and of these the editors selected 111"" (Grolier Medicine 12).

The work was based on the treatment of a head wound sustained by Lorenzo de Medici (Duke of Urbino), the father of Catherine de Medici whose husband, Henri II, was the subject of Paré's work on Head Injuries.  The woodcut on the title page appeared in an earlier publication of de Benedictis: Alessandro Achillini & Augustinus de Ancona: Opusculum perutile de Cognitione Animae et eius Potentiis Augustini de Anchona Cum Quadam Questione Prosperi de Regio, 1503.

Lind was published in 1990.  
RCPE: The first separate treatise on head wounds, and their surgical treatment. Describes several types of skull fractures. Also discusses apoplexy, meningitis and paralysis. 
The work originated in a dispute between Berengario and some other physicians over the treatment of Lorenzo de Medici, who had suffered a skull fracture. Berengario described several types of skull fractures and grouped the resulting lesions according to their symptoms, drawing from his own observations, as well as contemporary medical knowledge, to cite the relation between location and neurological effect.
""He also discussed prognosis, diagnosis and treatment, described the technique of craniotomy and provided detailed illustrations of contemporary neurosurgical instruments. The title illustration is a typical representation of the medieval cell doctrine, which localized mental functions in the ventricles or ""cells"" of the brain."" (Norman).

""Berengario's book was the most original neurological treatise until then and was not surpassed until the appearance of Ambroise Paré's similar work in 1562, in which Paré expressed his appreciation of his predecessor's efforts and made use of them."" DSB.

FIRST EDITION OF THE FIRST SEPARATE TREATISE ON HEAD INJURIES AND THEIR NEUROSURGICAL TREATMENT. In 1517 Berengario was called to attend to Lorenzo de Medici who had suffered a gunshot wound and an occipital skull fracture in battle. This illustrated monograph was written as a result of the assignment and was dedicated to Lorenzo. ""Berengario was able to cite from contemporary knowledge or from his own direct observation the relationship between the location of the lesions and the resulting neurological effects ...

ff. cccccxxviii","The first significantly illustrated book on anatomy.  The ""musclemen"" served as a model for those of Vesalius 20 years later as did the skeleton holding skulls for the figure in the Epitome. Berngario's Isagogae brevis can be regarded as the model for Vesalius' Epitome, both being shorter versions of major books. Herrlinger cites a number of illustrations that show the influence of Leonardo's anatomcal drawings.

Scarce first edition, the ""starting point of the new anatomy"", as it was the first work since Galen to contain a significant amount of anatomical information derived from the author's own experience and observation. A commentary on the 14th-century anatomical text of Mondino de' Luzzi, who had reintroduced human dissection into anatomy, the work contains numerous observations by Berengario himself based on his own dissections. It also includes the first references to the vermiform appendix, the thymus gland, and the sphenoid sinus, as well as Berengario's denial of the presence of the rete mirabile, a structure described by Galen and found in some animals but not humans (ccccclix r-v) The head and brain are covered on ll. CCCCIIv-CCCCLIXv

Lind points out that Berengario's surname was actually Barigazzi as noted in his will.  The name Berengario does not appear in any of his works published during his lifetime.  After receiving some tutoring from Aldus Manutius who was tutor to the children of Lionello Pio, Prince of Carpi, he took a medical degree at Bologna where he studied under Gabriele Zerbi and Alessandro Achillini.

ff . [1], 2–80","Second edition but first with illustrations of the heart and brain.  The title border appeared in Berengario's Commentaria 1521.  The plate of the brain is a transaxial view at the level of the atrium of the lateral ventricles.  It is probably the first illustration of the brain from an actual dissection. Other than the marginal illustrations on Schott's fugitive leaf in Gersdorff, this is the first non-schematic illustration of the brain.  This work in its abridged form of Berengario's commentary on Mundinus of 1521 can be compared to the Epitome of Vesalius. Berengario followed Mondino but added original descriptions of the sphenoid sinus, the pineal gland, the tympanum, the valves of the heart, the lateral ventricles and the choroid plexus.

1. Decorative woodcut borders have been added to the plates of the Commentaria
2. The plates of the heart D7v, D8r and D8v and brain G8r are new to the 1523 edition. Another plate new to the 1523 edition is the seated muscle figure on I4r.  
 
3. Other differences between the 1521 and 1523 works are the illustrations of the vertebrae, and the figures of the uterus. 
 
I have always thought that the Commentaria and Isagogae are analogous to the Fabrica & Epitome.  Also the use of full page illustrations set in a landscape background in Berengario must have been a model for Vesalius.  Interestingly the female figure C7v also can be considered a model for Estienne's illustrations.

 The second edition of Beregario's Isagogae added three more anatomical woodcuts, as well as some revisions to the illustrations that had appeared in the first edition. ""These alterations and additions emphasize the anatomy of the heart and brain, and include THE FIRST PUBLISHED VIEW OF THE CEREBRAL VENTRICLES FROM AN ACTUAL DISSECTION."" (Norman, 189). The architectural title-border was first used in Berengario's Commentaria (1521). Here it has been altered to read ""Maria"" instead of ""Leo P.X.,"" and Berengario's surname ""Carpus"" appears both in the architrave and the vignette. The shield has also been altered to read ""YHS."" Berengario's woodcut illustrations of muscle men posed before a landscape background, while lacking in detail in comparison to those in Vesalius's Fabrica, make a bold and aesthetically graphic statement, and represent the model on which Vesalius based his series of larger and more scientifically portrayed muscle men. ""There are six dramatic woodcuts of men standing four square with their legs apart. The muscles are indicated by lines representing in a diagrammatic way the direction of the muscles fibers. In all but one the figures show us their own dissected parts by holding skin and muscle flaps away. All stand in a sketched-in landscape with a few hillocks and a few grass tufts or weeds.

Only in the middle of the 16th century; with the reawakening of anatomy based on direct observation as advocated by Berengario and Vesalius was there a glimmer of new innovative approaches to what might be considered neurosurgical procedures.... In 1518 the anatomist and surgeon Berengario da Carpi published the first 'modern' work on head injuries.  Berengario had participated in 1517 in the care of Lorenzo de Medici, who sustained an occipital skull fracture from a gunshot wound. Because of the successful outcome, Berengario wrote his work ' Tractatus de fractura...'. 

In addition to the treatment of Lorenzo, the overall management of head injuries is described. He also includes a description of the surgical treatment by using gravity to facilitate drainage of an abscess that resulted from a laceration of the brain. Berengario stressed that the surgeon must have appropriate instruments before beginning an operation of the brain. ... This work was the first to illustrate neurosurgical instruments. Many of these instruments appear in other books of the 16th and 17th centuries and are quite similar to those used today. The woodcuts on the title pages of the two 16th century editions of Berengario's book illustrate both the theoretical and the practical aspects of surgery during this time. The cut from the first edition of 1518 is a cartoon of the medieval concepts of localization of functions in the ventricles rather than in the brain substance itself. The cut from the second edition of 1535 shows the pragmatic side of the surgeon's responsibility to the injured patient in an age of violence and warfare .."" ESF. Greenblat.

Bernard of Gordon (c.1258-1318) of Scottish descent but born in France, was a professor at Montpellier from 1283 to 1307. He spent his entire teaching career at Montpellier and contributed greatly to the university's fame as the outstanding medical school in Europe. He completed the Lilium in 1305. In the Dark Ages (476-1000), European medicine was entirely in the hands of the Jewish and Arabian physicians when the founding of the medical school at Salerno in the eleventh century began to breathe new life into medicine. The Lilium preserves the Arabic tradition, but also contains much original material, and is one of the works which laid the foundations of medical literature in the fourteenth century, from the schools of Montpellier, Paris, Bologna and Padua. It contains, inter alia, the first description of a modern truss, the first mention of spectacles (oculus berellinus), and the suggestion that muscles move due to a mechanical action of the nerves. Modern studies have been made of Bernard's treatises on epilepsy, marasmus, smallpox, and urology. The Lilium was translated in the Middle Ages into French, German, Hebrew, Irish, French and Spanish, but never into English, although Bernard is mentioned in the prologue to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Demaitre says of Bernard (p. 169): ""It would be difficult to find a more worthy representatives of Montpellier?s claim to fame, of the academic tradition, and of the medical profession around 1300 than Bernard of Gordon.""","Contemporary blind stamped calf, catches, no clasps",292 x 212,Bernard of Gordon1487-1.jpg,Bernard of Gordon1487-2.jpg,Bernard of Gordon1487-3.jpg,Bernard of Gordon1487-4.jpg,James T.

Dedication of the author to Paulus Sidlovitium Polonum. Some slight and sporadic browning along the lower edge of a few papers but an example in more than good general condition. (Editio Princeps) First rare edition of both these works by the illustrious Bolognese humanist. In the first, the author gives life to a debate between three brothers (the first, a philosopher, the second, a doctor and the third, an orator) to settle a controversy over their father's will. The parent in fact establishes that his inheritance goes to the child who carries out the most useful profession for society. The three to get the paternal patrimony strenuously defend their activities but it is obviously the speaker who gets the inheritance because, even if his profession is probably the least useful, he is the best at defending it. In fact, the orator exposes the errors of the philosopher and the doctor drawing on sources such as Pythagoras, Empedocles, Plato, Hippocrates, Galen and Avicenna. The second work, from card B2, is an epistle on the art of governing and the optimal form of government. Beroaldo begins ""De optimo statu"" with a description of the different regimes considered legitimate, speaking of ""status popularis"", ""status paucarum"" and even ""status unius"" when referring to the monarchy, then reaching the same conclusions as Campano. The best state, he argues, can only be achieved if our sovereign or our chief magistrate remains oblivious to his own good and is sure to act in everything in such a way as to promote only public welfare. Filippo Beroaldo the Elder was a famous Italian humanist pupil of Francesco dal Pozzo. At the age of 19 he opened his own school in Bologna, later becoming a professor of rhetoric and poetry in 1472. In 1476 he went to Paris, where his lessons in classical texts attracted a large audience. In 1479 he returned to Bologna where he remained a very successful teacher until his death. Prolific teacher and successful writer, Beroaldo was known for his editions of classical authors such as Plautus, Cicero, Suetonius, but above all he is famous for his commentary on Apuleius's Golden Ass. He has also published a series of important treatises-orations on moral and social issues, among which these two works are among the best known and cited.","Half green gilt calf, marbled boards",203 x 152 Arrived 12-19-20,"Beroaldus, Philippus 1497-1.jpg","Beroaldus, Philippus 1497-2.jpg","Beroaldus, Philippus 1497-3.jpg","Beroaldus, Philippus 1497-4.jpg",Libreria Antiquaria Dentis (Turin),B4

First edition to be edited by Joannes Kaiser of Bertucci’s principal work, first printed in Lyon in 1509 and again in 1518. It “comprises the following sections: De regimine sanitatis; De aegretudinibus particularibus; De febribus; De crisi et de diebus creticis; De venenis; De decoratione. According to Sarton, it contains also a chapter on anatomy including a description of the brain” (Stillwell). This chapter appears on f. XII, and the following chapters are on the diseases of the brain. According to Hirsch and others the author’s name is Bertucci, but it is spelled Bertrucci in this book. He was a pupil of Mondino, continuing his practice of dissecting cadavers in the classroom, and the teacher of Guy de Chauliac, who makes frequent mention of him. He died in Bologna in about 1342. He is one of five anatomists between Mondino and the beginning of the sixteenth century to be listed by Baas (Outlines of the history of medicine, p. 297), the others being Petrus de Argelata, Montagnana, Achilini, and Gabriel de Zerbis.

Though Bertuccio's life remains undocumented, his work has left a permanent mark on the study of medicine. Bertuccio was an authority in surgery, but in practice he preferred nonsurgical procedures. His most notable writing was a systematic collection of diseases and treatments. For each ailment he discussed etiologic factors, gave the rational and empirical treatment, described the symptoms, and provided his prognosis for recovery. There is one chapter on anatomy which includes a description of the brain. Apoplexia is covered in Chapter IX f.

First Latin edition of Pietro Bizarri's account of the Turkish war in Hungary from 1540 to 1547. An Italian edition was published first in 1568 and 1569 in Lyons, and it was Bizzarri himself which translated it into Latin in order to reach a larger public. The dedication at the beginning is adressed to the 13 years old August of Saxony, son of Prince Elector August. It is dated January 1573 and gives the young man a brief account of the history of writing and of historiography. The Turkish war in Hungary (pp. 1-165) is followed by an account of the unrest in the Netherlands in 1566 and of other contemporary European occurrences (pp. 166-332). On p. 284 is the earliest published account of the death of Vesalius.  The somewhat longer account in the 1568 Italian edition of this work is translated by O'Malley on pp. 309-310 of his biography of Vesalius.  The present single imprint of Bizzari's ""Pannonicum bellum"" was one month later compiled in a collective edition together with the Latin translation ""Aula Turcicae"" of Antoine Geuffroy s ""Briefve description de la cour du grand Turc"" and with the ""Belli Cyprij inter Venetos et Zelymum Turcarum Imp."" as well by Bizzarri.

Contains descriptions of the Turkish War in Hungary 1564-68, siege of Malta, including conquests of the French in Florida and Canada. First edition with this title. 
Pietro Bizzarri (1525–1586) was an Italian historian and spy. Bizzarri was born at Sassoferrato in Umbria; or, according to some writers, at Perugia, and so is sometimes called Petrus Perusius. When young he went to Venice, but having become a Protestant he left for Germany, in 1545. After the Battle of Mühlberg (1547) he moved on to England, where he spent periods his life. On 4 July 1549 Bizzarri was admitted a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, by the royal commissioners for the visitation of the university, being incorporated there ad eundem; and Francis Russell became his patron. The accession of Queen Mary saw him leave England; he returned on the accession of Elizabeth I. Bishop John Jewel, prompted by Archbishop Matthew Parker, gave Bizzari the prebend of Alton Pancras in Salisbury Cathedral. This followed the presentation to the queen of his De principe tractatus.[1][2] Meanwhile Russell had become governor of Berwick. Bizzarri went north with him. He presented Mary, Queen of Scots with a different treatise, and shortly went abroad. Not receiving further church preferment, Bizzarri began to travel. He obtained, in 1570, a license from William Cecil to go abroad, to print his own works, and gather news of foreign affairs for the government. He passed some time at Genoa; in Germany he obtained, through the influence of Hubert Languet, employment with the Elector of Saxony. On 20 October 1573 he addressed from Augsburg a letter in Italian to Cecil, now Lord Burghley. He went on to Antwerp, where he met the scholarly circle around Christopher Plantin. In 1581 he asked Justus Lipsius in Leyden to find a publisher of his ""Universal History"" in eight volumes. He was back in Antwerp in December 1583; on 23 November 1586 he addressed a Latin letter from The Hague to Burghley.",Half vellum,145 x 93,"Bizzarri, Pietro [Bizarus, Petrus]                              1573-1.jpg","Bizzarri, Pietro [Bizarus, Petrus]                              1573-2.jpg","Bizzarri, Pietro [Bizarus, Petrus]                              1573-3.jpg","Bizzarri, Pietro [Bizarus, Petrus]                              1573-4.jpg",avelibro(DinkelscherbenGermany),C4

Première édition d’Antoine Vérard. Elle est magnifiquement illustrée par 10 grands bois gravés. C’est une traduction en français du «De casibus virorum illustrium» par Laurent de Premierfait. Partant d’Adam et Eve, Boccace passe en revue les «cas et ruynes des nobles et femmes renversés par la fortune depuis la création du monde». On y trouve le récit des malheurs d’Athalie, de Denys de Syracuse, de Mithridate, de Philippe le Bel, de Pétrarque et de beaucoup d’autres, avec des considérations sur les songes prémonitoires, l’inconstance de la fortune, les dangers de l’oisiveté, etc. (Bechtel).
Le texte de cette édition reprend, avec un style rajeuni, celui de l’édition de 1483, chez Jean Dupré, qui est le premier livre parisien illustré. Dans l’histoire de l’imprimerie parisienne, Antoine Vérard tient une place majeure. Libraire- éditeur, très actif, il est celui qui a le plus contribué au développement de l’art de l’illustration dans le livre français.
Le premier feuillet (a1) est un facsimilé sur papier ancien. Il ne porte que deux lignes de texte : «Des nobles malheureux. Imprimé nouvellement à Paris», le verso est blanc. Il manque deux feuillets blancs (M10 et EE8). Texte sur deux colonnes en caractères gothiques. Initiales tracée au pinceau en rouge. L’exemplaire a été lavé.
Exemplaires conservés en France: BNF (2 ex.) et Institut de France (incomplet). Très rare. Nous n’avons pas trouvé d’exemplaire passé en vente depuis 40 ans.
<> Vérard’s first edition. It is beautifully illustrated by 10 large woodcuts. It is a French translation of «De casibus virorum illustrium» by Laurent de Premierfait. Boccace deals with the fortunes and calamities of famous people starting with the biblical Adam, going to mythological and ancient people, then to people of Boccaccio’s own time, with considerations on the premonitory dreams, the inconstancy of the fortune, the dangers of the idleness, etc... The work was successful, influencing many other famous authors such as Geoffrey Chaucer. The text of this edition is, with a modernized style, that of the edition of 1483, by Jean Dupré, which is the first illustrated Parisian book. Folio a1 is in facsimile, bearing only two lines of text: ""Des nobles malheureux. Imprimé nouvellement à Paris"", verso is blanck. It lacks two blanks leaves (M10 et EE8).

pp. [68], 1200, [64]","First Latin edition translated by the Strasbourg physician and botanist David Kyber (1525-1553). The number of woodcuts was increased by almost one hundred, the text revised and enlarged, and for the first time, extended by Conrad Gesner's preface and bibliography of 300 botanical writers from the antiquity.  Gesner's influence is also evident in the the 5 indexes to the work (in Greek, Latin, German, Arabic, and Hebrew) and in an elaborate subject index, both modeled after the indexes to his Historia animalium.  About a fourth of the woodcuts are in contemporary coloring, among them the portrait and the striking genre scenes of trees in the third part.  A title label is attached to the last fly leaf to serve as a label for the book when inserted into a shelf spine first.   Hieronymus Bock was intended for a monastic life, but he rebelled against his parents' wishes and attended university instead. He began his career as a schoolteacher, but became fortunate enough to attract the attention of the Count Palatine Ludwig, who employed him as superintendent of his gardens in Zweibruecken. Bock made extensive botanical study-trips to the Hunsrueck, the Eifel, the Ardennes, the Vosges, the Swiss Jura, and the countries of the Rhine. He collected plants and cultivated his private garden in order to study their relations, with naming he followed antique examples. The first edition (1539) of Bock's herbal was not illustrated, the second one, published in 1546, had 465 woodcuts only, of which many had been copied from the works of Otto Brunfels and Leonhard Fuchs by the Strasbourg artist David Kandel (1527?-1595).   The significance of the work lies mostly in the accurate description of the structure of plants, as well as in that of their development in the course of the vegetation period, elaborate descriptions of the places where they were found are given. Unlike the other two so-called German Fathers of Botany, Bock set the authorities aside and chose to rely primarily on his own observations and experimentation. Until 1553 all editions were supervised by the author himself.  The great achievement of Bock was as a pioneer of descriptive botany (phytography). Brunfels' herbal had not sold well, and it was probably in part Bock's inability to persuade his publisher to pay for illustrations for the first edition of his New Kreütter Buch (1539) that obliged him to describe in detail facts that Brunfels and Fuchs mistakenly believed to have been adequately dealt with by their artists. In 1546 Bock, by judicious saving, was in a position to subsidize an illustrated edition of his herbal, now renamed Kreuter Buch.  Bock's book sold far better than Brunfels', better even than those of Fuchs. Hieronymus Bock's herbal was by far the most popular of the time and was re-issued in about twenty editions up to the 17th century.  The treatise of Benedict Textor (fl. 1530-1556) on Dioscorides is also included.  Inscription on flyleaf dated 1648. RCPE: Written by the second of the ""German fathers of botany"", Bock's 'Kreutterbuch' marked a new beginning in botany. Originally written in the vernacular it only became widely recognised with the above Latin translation. In his description of ca.700 plants and trees, Bock attempted to classify them into three groups: herbs and odoriferous plants, clovers or grasses, and trees or shrubs

pp. [2], 3–150 [2]","The work contains the first illustrations of burr holes interconnected to create a bone flap rather than simple trephination.  The illustrations next appeared in 1569 edition of Dalechamps. Botallo supported Maggi (his former pupil) and Paré in denying the poisonous nature of gunshot wounds as had been advocated by Vigo and Ferri.  He too advocated mild treatment of gunshot wounds. This influential work went through several editions: Venice (1564) and Frankfurt (1575), as well as being inserted in a miscellany on military medicine published in Venise in 1566.
Botallo came from Asti and studied under Falloppius and Vittore Trincavelli (1496-1548).  Botallo was physician to Charles IX and Henri III.  His name is associated with the congenital cardiac anomalies of the duct and foramen of Botallo.  Through his observation, he discovered or independently rediscovered that the blood's passage from the right to the left side of the heart in the fetus was by way of the foramen ovale cordis (Botallo's foramen). His discovery was published in De catarrho commentarius (Paris,1564). He also observed the arterial duct from the pulmonary artery to the aorta which also carries his name although he was not the original discoverer of either of these features.

Catherine de' Medici, was instrumental in having his services transferred to her favorite son, the Duke of Anjou, later Henry III.  He practiced medicine in Asti before 1544, and joined the French forces in Italy as a military surgeon.  In 1560 he was already located in Paris as one of the physicians of Charles IX, having been called there by his patron, Catherine de' Medici.  Sometime before 1575 he became physician to the Duke of Anjou, later Henry III. At various times he was also physician to Elizabeth of Austria, Louise of Lorraine, William Duke of Brabant, the Duke of Guise, and Prince William of Orange.

He had a regular stipend of 400 livres and apparently received other payments. 
Sometime before 1575 he became physician to the Duke of Anjou, later Henry III. At various times he was also physician to Elizabeth of Austria, Louise of Lorraine, William Duke of Brabant, the Duke of Guise, and Prince William of Orange. 
Mazzuchelli says that he was appointed Bishop of St. Malo. Careri says that this is not documented and no one else mentions it. However, Henry III made him a counselor and conferred honorary ecclesiastical positions, from which he could have the income, on him. There is documentary evidence that he held the Abbacy of Notre Dame de Change. 
Near the end of his life, Botallo was apparently in economic straits. (Note that he did not enrich himself.) Catherine de' Medici took steps to insure that he had enough money. She had him confirmed in the Abbacy of Notre Dame de Chage, a position he was able to pass on, during his life but not after his death, to a nephew who was a cleric. Catherine de' Medici wrote a number of letters for him in her own hand, some to the King, wanting to be sure that one who had served her well was not neglected.

ff. 145, [3]","The Ship of Fools is the most important of a long line of moralizing works in which the weaknesses and vices of mankind are satirized as follies. The tradition goes back to early medieval times both in England and on the Continent...In a ship laden with one hundred fools, steered by fools to the fools' paradise of Narragonia, Brant satirizes all the weakness, follies and vices of his time. Composed in popular humorous verse and illustrated by a remarkable series of woodcuts...the book was an immediate success. Brant's purpose was a moral one: he wanted to improve the life of his contemporaries and to help in the regeneration of the Holy Roman Empire and the Church...the book also contains the earliest literary reference to the discovery of America [on k4v]; the Columbus Letter had been published by the same printer the year previously. The influence of The Ship of Fools was extensive and prolonged: thirty-six editions were published between 1494 and 1513...There were twelve translations in about forty different editions. Its most immediate imitators were Geiler von Kaisersberg, Thomas Murner, Hans Sachs and Johannes Fischart in Germany, where the ëNarrí as a type has lived until today. Erasmusís Moriae Encomium was directly inspired by it. The Ship of Fools was the first original work by a German which passed into world literature...[It] played an important part in European literature, and helped to blaze the trail that leads from medieval allegory to modern satire, drama and the novel of character (Printing and the Mind of Man). The Latin version of Das Narrenschiff was made under Brant's close supervision by his favorite pupil Jacobus Locher (1471-1528).

Before Goethe’s Werther arrived on the scene, this work was the most successful book ever published in Germany, immensely popular and read until it fell to pieces. This is one of literature’s most famous satires and a remarkable illustrated book. Sebastian Brant describes in his “Ship of Fools” the voyage of a ship bearing 100 fools, to the fools’ paradise of Narragonia, and he satirizes all the follies of his time including representatives of every human and social type.

PMM calls it “the first original work by a German which passed into world literature.and helped to blaze the trail that leads from medieval allegory to modern satire, drama and novel of character”.  The reference to the newly discovered America is found on fol. 76 verso (cf. Harrise, BAV, Additions, no. 21).

Nowadays, in general, about two-thirds of the 114 illustrations (counting 9 repeating ones) in the 1494 edition are attributed to the young Dürer, while the rest, which are found inferior in design and cutting, are ascribed to anonymous masters, such as the so-called Master of the Haintz Narr (named after the namesake scene in The Ship of Fools). A more conservative view, expressed by the art historian Erwin Panofsky in 1945, attributes only one-third of the illustrations to Dürer.

Notes: This 'curious and amusing droll old book' (as per an old bookseller's description tipped onto the inside fron cover) first appeared in German in 1494, and in Latin, at Basle, 1 March 1497, of which this a reprint with different woodcuts. There was another Strasbourg reprint (Strasbourg being Brant's native city) by Johann Schönsperger, 1 April 1497, which included the Basle colophon. Brant spared no-one in his satire, and the book immediately became immensely popular, in fact an unprecedented bestseller, with numerous authorised and unauthorised editions.

This is Brunfel's first publication. He edited an edition of prayers and sayings from the Bible in 1528. Brunfel received his doctor of medicine degree in Basel, 1532. His bibliography contains 750 entries, listing over 300 authors and their works in chronological order. It opens with an alphabetical index of authors and ends with a six-page subject index.  The woodcut title page border is by Hans Weiditz and shows portraits with the names of ancient physicians: Hippocrates, Galen, Oribasius, Soranus, Celsus, Herophilus, Plinius and others.  Weiditz also created the images for Brunfel's herbal 1530-1536. Brief non-bibliographical entries for approximately 300 classical writers from ancient times to the end of the 15th century.  The entries are in chronological order.  Short synopses of works but no details about the editions are provided.

pp. [372]","First edition, a second edition appeared in 1543.  Woodcut of on p.12 of Sts. Cosimas and Damien as on tp of Gersdorff.

Rare first edition of Brunfels’s early medical dictionary, written to assist practicing physicians and apothecaries reading the standard medical-botanical authors of the time (Galen, Dioscorides, Pliny). The work precedes by thirty years Estienne’s better known Dictionarium medicum and is more encyclopedic than lexicographical, making it difficult to understand why it is omitted from Garrison-Morton (see #6787 and following): G-M lists two incunable dictionaries which pre-date this, as does Fries 1519 Synonima. Since the components of most medicaments were natural, the work is properly included in botanical bibliographies (Pritzel, etc.). Though “medicine” appears in the title, the work encompasses a much wider field than that designated nowadays by the term, including entries relating to botany, meteorology, alchemy and even magic. 

Brunfels’s passion for collecting and organizing vast amounts of information into intelligent, digestible form is evident from his first publication, the Catalogus illustrium medicorum (1530), one of the earliest medical bibliographies; it can even be seen in his greatest work, the Herbarum, which changed the study of botany, freeing it from the superstitions of medieval herbals.

These leaves are not rubricated.","This work can be considered the first book on surgery to be illustrated.  It also contains the first published account of gunshot wounds, antedating Vigo's work: Practica in arte chirurgica [1514].  This is the reissue or pirated edition of the Grüninger publication in Strasbourg which first appeared 4 July 1497.  Some corrections by Hans Schönsperger were added in this Augsburg edition of December 1497.  The Strasbourg edition is printed in 2 columns and the Augsburg in a single column which conveys less of a medieval appearance to the work.  Eleven small woodcuts show surgical instruments.  Although this is considered the first illustrated book of surgery, there is no image that helps the surgeon perform his operations.  The images are made from smaller woodblocks that are rearranged throughout the book to provide different scenes of consultations that are of limited surgical value.  The emphasis is on common problems such as wounds, fractures, dislocations and medications.  The 1460 manuscript of Heinrich Pfolspeundt on gunshot wounds was not published until the 19th century.  The woodcuts of the lecturer, the interior of the apothecary shop and the skeletal figure used by Grüninger in the added chapter on anatomy also appear in Ortus Sanitatis of 1497 published by Johann Prüss. The piracy prompted Grüninger to reissue his work with four additional chapters including one on amputation as well as a correction of the last quire to correct the misprint in the colophon of 1397 for 1497. Cushing has the ""1397"" edition & Yale also has an incomplete colored copy of the Augsburg edition.  There are several variations among the corrected Grüninger copies since the new additions were added in different amounts to the remaining copies of the first issue. There are 49 illustrations with some repeats.  

Eleven small woodcuts show surgical instruments. In both editions, some of the woodblocks are divided into halves and are used in different combinations. The work is of limited surgical value, but it is the earliest surgical work with illustrations although not of actual surgical procedures as in Gersdorff.  The emphasis is on common problems such as wounds, fractures, dislocations and medications.  It also contains the first published account of gunshot wounds, antedating Vigo's work: Practica in arte chirurgica [1514].  The 1460 manuscript of Heinrich Pfolspeundt was not published until the 19th century. A woodcut illustrating the treatment of a head wound appears for the first time in 1513 and is the earliest printed illustration of this topic.  The woodcuts of the lecturer, the interior of the apothecary shop and the skeletal figure used by Grüninger in the added chapter on anatomy also appear in Ortus Sanitatis of 1497 published by Johann Prüss.

An edition with corrections by Hans Schönsperger appeared in December 1497 in Augsburg.   This prompted Grüninger to reissue his work with four additional chapters including one on amputation as well as the last quire to correct the misprint in the colophon of 1397 for 1497. (Cushing has the ""1397"" edition [Goff B1225] & Yale also has a colored copy of the Augsburg edition [Goff B1226.]  There are several variations among copies since the new additions were added in different amounts to the remaining copies of the first issue.  The woodblocks are again divided into halves and used in different combinations.  There are also small cutouts of woodblocks to allow for changes in healing of different wounds.  These changes are seen in the first edition but the small inserts were probably lost by the time of this printing.  The technique can be seen in the illustrations on K2r, K5r and P2r.  The insert is missing from the illustration on P1r leaving a blank rectangle.  This certainly predates the use of this method always cited for Estienne.  In this edition there are 10 full page cuts and 6 repeats for a total of 16 full woodcuts and 25 illustrations made of repeated split woodblocks.  Collation complete but foliation errors occur on ll. xxxii, lii, liii, lvi, xc, ci, cxviii, & cxxiii.  A woodcut illustrating the treatment of a head wound appears for the first time in this 1513 and is the earliest printed illustration of this topic.  This corresponds to the description of Sudhoff 58a.  An Augsburg edition was reissued in 1534 and 1539. 

The work is of limited surgical value but is the earliest surgical work with illustrations although not of actual surgical procedures as in Gersdorff.  The only operation described is amputation.

ff. I–CCCXXX","Beautiful large woodcut on title, ff. roman numb. 330, illustrated throughout with 145 woodcuts (one double- page). Second edition (first 1512), nonetheless rare, of the so called “Grosses Distillierbuch” by Hieronymus Brunschwig (circa 1450 - circa 1512), who, after receiving an education in surgery, traveled extensively through Alsace, South and Middle Germany, practicing as surgeon and acquiring knowledge on chemistry and pharmacology with a particular interest for distillation. At the end of the 15th century he moved permanently to Strasbourg and published soon his first works, one of his earliest was the Kleinen Distillierbuchs in 1500, printed by Grüninger, which would become the base for the Grosses Distillierbuch later on. Following still the style of the incunabula herbals, his work was the first to introduce the extraction of essential oils from plants. The first part of the book occupies itself with the procedures and technical practice of distillery by steam and required instruments as well as the base materials (plants but also animals), it also described how to separate alcohol from wine, mead or fermented fruits. Within the second part the author lists a quite good number of plants and the single qualities of their different parts. the third and last part contains a list of essential oils, in order of their therapeutic qualities, aromatic and empyreumatic ones.

A work on veterinarian medicine, Proprytees & Medicynes of Hors, was printed by Wynckn de Worde ca. 1497-98 and again in 1502.  Pynson published several works of Galen from 1522-1524(Rylands p. 716).  This is a handbook for laymen on hygiene and diet not written for physicians or surgeons. (See Ham House Catalogue, 1938 and Morgan Library-Early Printed Books: 23). The only earlier medical or surgical works printed in England, although they are in Latin, are several editions of Linacre's translations of Galen: 1522, 1523 & 1524 published by Pynson in London and Siberch 1521-1524 in Cambridge (see  Hultman Lot 256 & Freeling Lot 1299, Roy 1107).  See McKerrow and Ferguson: Title -page Borders. 1932.  

Although the text is a translation of Brunschwig, the illustrations are copied from Gersdorff.  The 8 full page woodcuts are copied after Gersdorff (the first of many copies) and a version of the cerebral ventricular system similar to Reisch and Romberch de Kyrspe.  Unlike the other editions of Brunschwig (1497 Strasbourg and Augsburg folios, 1534 and 1539 Augsburg quartos), this edition uses wood cuts copied from Gersdorff and other sources which represent surgical and anatomical views rather than the generic illustrations of medical scenes found in the original edition.

""The Booke of Simples is of considerable interest, as being one of the earliest of English herbals. Bullein traveled much and made minute observations wherever he went; but his descriptions of what he observed are more valuable than his explanations. He garnishes his pages freely with precepts and homilies, and shows a naive anxiety to impress his readers with the fact that he is pursuing his investigations with a view to promoting the practical welfare of the community ... he gives a long list of eminent English chirurgians, mentioning the achievements of each' (A.H. Bullen in DNB). In fact Bullein 'mentions the achievements' of only a few English physicians ˆ William Turner, John Caius, Thomas Eliot, Thomas Faire, Andrew Boorde, and William Cunningham. He does however provide a list of those, ancient and modern, ""which have been excellent in the worthy art of Chirurgi,"" among the moderns, Conrad Gesner, Ryff, Tagault, Fuchs, Massa, Pol, Brunfels, Matthioli, and Paracelsus. The Booke of Compoundes ends with ""Apothicaries rules."" Among these are the injunction to read Dioscorides, and the requirement that the apothecary's garden be close at hand, and the apothecary needs to tend it himself.  Bullein's own writings are the chief authority for his biography. In this book he tells how he wrote it while in prison, falsely accused.

","Carcano was the pupil and chosen successor of Gabriele Falloppio.  This did not materialize after Falloppio's death in 1562.  Carcano became professor of anatomy in Pavia.  In 1593 he published a work that ""first"" describes the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus.  Copies exist with 1583 and 1584 dates on title page. Colophon reads: Apud Pacificum Pontium, impensis D. Petri Tini, 1583.
 
GM 1479. Anatomici libri II 1574.  Carcano was the first to describe the true position of the lacrimal gland and the lacrimal duct.

Elève à Pavie de Pietro Martire, disciple de Vésale, Carcano (Milan, 1536 - Pavie, 1606) est nommé chirurgien du corps de l'artillerie dans l'armée du duc d'Albe. Il se spécialise alors dans l'étude des blessures par armes à feu, et s'engage dans des réflexions contre les méthodes chirurgicales des Espagnols qu'il considère inutilement douloureuses. Il est chargé de la direction de l'hôpital militaire de Milan, puis passe deux ans à Padoue où il rencontre Gabriele Falloppia qui l'initie à l'anatomie moderne et publie ses recherches sur le coeur du foetus et l'oeil. Dépassé par Fabricius de Aquapendente à la chaire d'anatomie de Padoue, il obtient celle de Pavie. Sa renommée fut encore accrue par la permission qu'il reçut de pratiquer l'autopsie du grand évèque Charles Borromée, mort en 1584.

Fort de ses expériences depuis sa jeunesse sur les champs de bataille, il compile et revoit alors un ensemble de cas de blessures qu'il avait eues à traiter et publie son oeuvre finale, De vulneribus capitis, version moderne du De vulneribus capitis d'Hippocrate quelque mille ans plus tôt. 
Divisé en trois parties, l'ouvrage traite de l'anatomie cranienne, des contusions et fractures et chirurgie craniennes et ses thérapeutiques post-opératoires. Il met en garde contre les coups légers mais mortels, la trépanation systématique, l'usage d'onguents et emplâtres..., à l'aide d'observations pratiques d'une grande précision, basées sur l'expérience et l'examen, en plein accord avec les principes de la médecine humaniste.

Minor worming in first and last few leaves, single small wormhole in last few gatherings, short tear in inner margin of s5, a few small marks and some very faint residual stains.

The De medicina was the first organised treatise on medicine to be printed, and the first Western history of medicine. Written in about A.D. 30, it remains the greatest medical treatise from ancient Rome. Celsus’ fine literary style earned him the title of Cicero medicorum, his Latin terminology creating a nomenclature that is still in use today. His work is in eight books, the first four of which deal with diseases treated by diet and regimen, the last four describing those amenable to drugs and surgery. The third book contains, among other things, the first use of the term ‘insanity’ (Insania), and the first adumbration of heart disease (Cardiacus), which became the canon of subsequent knowledge in antiquity. The fourth book contains the four classical signs of inflammation (dolor, tumor, rubor, calor). The fifth book begins with a classified list of drugs, followed by a chapter on weights and measures, pharmaceutical methods, and prescriptions. The sixth book treats of skin and venereal diseases, as well as those of the eye, ear, nose, throat and mouth. The seventh book is surgical (see Garrison pp. 107–109). The surgical chapters contain the first account of the use of the ligature, excellent descriptions of lateral lithotomy and herniotomy, and the earliest discussion in Western literature of the repair of mutilations, including plastic operations for restoring the nose, lips, ears, etc. (Zeis Index 21 and 2116; “certainly the earliest writer on plastic surgery,” p. 1). There are numerous important contributions to dentistry, and a classic description of malaria (Major p. 96). 

The printer, Nicolaus [Laurentius Alemannus], was responsible for the first book with engravings, Dante with the Botticelli imagres in 1481. Also know as Niccolò di Lorenzo della Magna, Nicolaus Laurentii (fl. 1477–1485) is the Latin form of the name of Niccolò di Lorenzo, also known as Niccolò Todesco (""Nicholas the German"").

Two medical works, collected by Hector Pömer, one of the most influential of Nuremberg churchmen during the Reformation. Dürer's large woodcut depicts a full-length figure of St Lawrence, reflecting the fact that Pömer became provost of the Nuremberg parish of St. Lorenz in 1520. There are annotations by different contemporary hands in the two works. The annotations in the Villanova are cropped by the binder for whose work Pömer paid '84d.' on 23 July 1525. The 1497 Celsus is the fourth edition of 'the oldest medical document after the Hippocratic writings' (Garrison and Morton 20). Written c.30 A.D., the De medicina was lost for most of the Middle Ages until it was recovered in 1426-1443. It was the first organized treatise on medicine to be printed (at Florence in 1478). Arnaldus de Villanova, probably Catalonian by birth, studied medicine at Montpellier until 1260, and was later personal physician to several popes and kings of Aragon, in spite of which he was imprisoned on several occasions and had his more controversial works censored and burned.

The present printing would appear to be the third edition.  ¶Celsus: This is the second oldest medical document after the Hippocratic writings; it was written about 30 AD.  A manuscript of the work was rediscovered in Milan in 1443.  This is usually cited as a compilation of other writers rather than as an original work.  The first printed edition appeared in Florence in 1478; an Aldine edition was published in 1528.
First Edition of Scribonius (G-M 1785), with early editions of Celsus (G-M 20) and Benivieni (G-M 2270). The first medical author of note after Celsus, Scribonius was physician to the Empress Messalina and accompanied the Emperor Claudius on his expedition to Britain in 43 A.D. He wrote his work on pharmacology shortly thereafter, giving a collection of 271 remedies, including the first definition of opium as an extract, the first account of electrotherapy for headaches (via the torpedo's shock), an expectorant mixture for phthisis, and an early reference to the Hippocratic Oath. Considered the earliest extant dispensatory (Kremers & Urdang, p. 19), De compositionibus medicamentorum contains both scientific and magical remedies, including the drinking of one's own blood.

Champier examines the conformity between Plato and Aristotle on the one hand, and Galen and Hippocrates on the other. The punning title is taken up in the lovely woodcut on the titlepage, showing a symphony of the four characters, in a string quartet with Galen on fiddle, perhaps leading the quartet, Plato, Aristotle and Hippocrates on viols and cellos.
Symphorien Champier was born at St. Saphorine-le-Château, in the Lyonais, and gained his medical education at Montpellier. He was an alderman of the city of Lyon in 1520 and in 1533 established the College of Medicine in the city. Champier studied Greek and Arabic texts and wrote a number of historical works as well as his large output of medical works.
Garrison calls him ‘One of the earliest of the French humanists’ and ‘one of the last of the conciliators of Greek and Arabist doctrine’ (History of Medicine, 4th edition, 1929, p. 196).

Dans ce curieux traité, le médecin lyonnais Symphorien Champier (v. 1471-1538) s'attache à démontrer la conformité entre les doctrines d'Aristote et de Platon, d'une part, et celles d'Hippocrate et de Galien, d'autre part (Hippocrate occupant selon lui la position la plus élevée parmi ces ""quatre princes de la médecine"").

The charming title-woodcut shows the author seated at a desk in a garden, holding in his left hand an enormous rose and pointing with his right to a closed book.

It discusses food and drink, and various bodily functions such as sleeping, bathing, exercising, and sexual intercourse.

He also served in the navy before he settled in London in 1569 and worked at St. Bartholomew's and Christ's Hospital.  He was considered to be one of the outstanding surgeons of this period although he made no specific contribution.  In 1585 Queen Elizabeth sent him to the Low Countries under the Earl of Leicester.

DNB: Clowes began practice in 1563 as a surgeon in the army commanded by Ambrose, earl of Warwick, in France, and on this expedition began his lifelong friendship with John Banester the surgeon (Banester, Antidotarie, 1589; Clowes, Treatise on Struma, 1602). Besides a power of ready expression in colloquial English, he shows a vast acquaintance with proverbs, and a fair knowledge of French and of Latin. His books were all printed in London in black letter and 4to, and are: 1. ‘De Morbo Gallico,’ 1579. 2. ‘A Prooved Practise for all young Chirurgians concerning Burnings with Gunpowder, and Woundes made with Gunshot, Sword, Halbard, Pike, Launce, or such other,’ 1591. 3. ‘Treatise of the French or Spanish Pocks, by John Almenar,’ 1591 (a fresh edition of 1). 4. ‘A Profitable and Necessary Book of Observations,’ 1596 (a fresh edition of 2). 5. ‘A Right Frutefull and Approved Treatise for the Artificiall Cure of the Struma or Evill, cured by the Kinges and Queenes of England,’ 1602. In 1637 reprints of his ‘De Morbo Gallico’ and ‘Profitable Book of Observations’ were published. Letters by him are printed in Banester's ‘Antidotarie’ (1589), and in Peter Lowe's ‘Surgery’ (1597).",Modern Brown calf,184 x 140,"Clowes, William1591-1.jpg","Clowes, William1591-2.jpg","Clowes, William1591-3.jpg","Clowes, William1591-4.jpg",Christie's- Norman I / Phillips,C3

First edition, second issue (a few copies are dated 1572). One of the most important early anatomical books, comprising ten works, including three on general anatomy, two on the anatomy of the skeleton and foetal skeleton, and one on the egg of the chick, on comparative anatomy, on the eye, the ear, and finally miscellaneous observations which includes narratives of twelve autopsies. These works include the earliest study of the growth of the skeleton as a whole in the human foetus, the first description of the spinal ganglia and musculus corrrugtor supercilii, the first published study of the development of the chick embryo based on daily observation (which is also the first work on embryology since Aristotle), and the first monograph on the ear.
The tract on comparative anatomy is to be regarded as the first scientific work on the subject. “…the first to elevate this study to the rank of an independent branch of biology, is the Frisian Volcher Coiter, whose relevant works were published in 1572 [his tract on comparative osteology] and 1575” (Cole).
Coiter was one of the first anatomists to draw his own illustrations — all but two of the engravings are signed ‘V. C. D.’ for ‘Volcher Coiter delineavit’. The first two plates are four views of the skull, followed by two double-page plates of the skeleton of a child, two full page plates of adult skeletons after Vesalius (but more accurate in anatomical detail; see Herlinger pp. 128–130), and a double-page plate of the skeleton of a monkey.

Some copies are dated 1572. Certain individual works had first appeared in Bologna, 1564 and 1566, but they are here united (revised by the author) with others, for the first time. Three plates, depicting the base of an adult human skull, the body of a human foetus and the skeletal system of a child, are the earliest known in the fields of embryology and infantile anatomy, and were copied by Felix Platter in 1583, and Laurentius (du Laurens) in 1599. The treatise that accompanies these images is the earliest to compare adult, adolescent, and foetal anatomies and describe the point at which skeletal ossification begins. The present work established Coiter's reputation as the founder of comparative osteology. It was meant as a practical guide to medical students, as evidenced by the detailed engravings and also the synoptic tables, which describe the external and internal attributes of the human body, the ossification of the bones, and human vision each in great detail, giving both Greek and Latin terms and references from Hippocrates, Galen, and Aristotle. It also included the first monograph on the ear.

Volcher Coiter hailed from the Netherlands, but in line with the leading anatomists of his day he received medical training in Italy, moving between the influences of the most prominent teachers; Falloppio in Padua, Eustachi in Rome, and most significantly Aldrovandi in Bologna, where in 1562 he obtained his doctorate in medicine and began the present work. His treatise on embryology included here, and its reliance on an emerging interest in morbid dissection are particularly influenced by the Bologna School. But by 1566, Coiter was forced to leave Italy after imprisonment by the Inquisition for his Protestant beliefs. He continued work on osteology, and expanded his interests into avian anatomy on which he published significant comparative studies in 1569, while serving as physician to the city of Nuremberg. ""In his short life of forty-two years Coiter effected significant advances in biological knowledge"" DSB III, 342.
""Coiter was one of the first to draw the illustrations for his own publications-- his illlustrations of the adult skeleton and skull, after Vesalius, are superior in anatomical detail-- and his sketches of fetal skeletons are original"", Norman 496.
The plates are signed V.C.D. and were drawn by Coiter himself. Dryander also drew his own illustrations.",Contemporary half red vellum with BSPS spine,380 x 245,"Coiter, Volcher  1573-1.jpg","Coiter, Volcher  1573-2.jpg","Coiter, Volcher  1573-3.jpg","Coiter, Volcher  1573-4.jpg",Christopher Sokol/ SF Book Fair,E7

Colombo as well as Pope Paul died as the book was being completed.  Colombo's sons, Lazaro and Febo, replaced the original dedication with a new one to Pius IV, mentioning their father's recent death.  Colombo was present at the autopsy of St. Ignatius Loyola which is described.  It is here that Colombo defines his discovery of the pulmonary or lesser circulation, i.e., the passage of blood from the right cardiac ventricle to the left via the lungs. Included is the denial of pores in the interventricular septum.  Although ibn an-Nafis in the 13th century and Servetus had described this phenomenon, it was unknown to the world of anatomists.  The concept first appeared in print in 1556 in the work of Colombo's pupil Valverde. Colombo describes the duplications of the peritoneum, the ventricles of the larynx, and the mode of action of the pulmonary, cardiac, and aortic valves, clearing up a number of errors of his predecessors. Colombo, a friend of Michelangelo, was a pupil of Vesalius and later became his successor in the chair of anatomy at Padua. He is among the first to perform vivisection on dogs instead of hogs, for the reason that the latter were ""annoying by their squealing."" 
 ""Colombo's is best known for his discovery of the pulmonary or lesser circulation... Although overshadowed by his discovery of the pulmonary circulation, Colombo's observations of the heartbeat apparently directly inspired Harvey's vivisectional studies on the heart, which in turn led to his discovery of the greater circulation"" (Norman, 501).  His discoveries paved the way for William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of blood. Harvey studied in Padua some 50 years later.  Liber VIII/XV deals with the nervous system.

Cornarius (or Hagenbut, 1500-58), a native of Zwickau, was, according to Hirsch, one of the most passionate and meritorious of the 16th century medical philologists. He edited and translated many Greek medical texts, including Dioscorides and Aetius as well as contributing to the great Basel editions of Hippocrates and Galen. These works show the author's preference for Greek medicine over the Arab medical tradition.  Cornarius took his medical degree at Wittenberg and traveled widely including Scandinavia, England, and France. In 1530 he returned to his native town where he established a medical practice and finally became professor of medicine at Marburg and Jena. While living in Basel (1528-30), Cornarius came to know Erasmus who was much impressed with his achievements. 

Cornarius had a controversy with Fuchs???  Cornarius was included in the Index of 1564.  Waller 4488 a Hippocratic work edited by Cornarius has Vesalius' signature on the title page although the two were at odds since Cornarius was an ardent Galenist.

Council of Trent (1545-1563): Pope Paul III (1534-1549); Pope Julius III (1550-1555);  Pope Pius IV (1559-1565).  The northern Italian city of Trent was the venue of an ecumenical council at three meetings held in 1545-9, 1551-2 & 1562-3. It helped to define more precisely the doctrines of the Roman Church in opposition to those of the Reformation. This is evident in the Council's rejection of the Protestant views on original sin and in the reaffirmati on of the doctrine of transubstantiation. Although papal autocracy was strengthened since the Council depended on the Pope's consent to validate decrees, the Council ultimately secured the future spiritual efficiency of the Roman Church, as when provision was made for the establishment of seminaries for the training of the clergy in every diocese.

Earlier references list this as ca. 1470 and give Mentelin as the printer. Adolf Rusch and Martin Schott were Mentelin's sons-in-law.  This printer is now generally identified with Adolf Rusch of Ingeweiler, who married Johann Mentelin's daughter Salome and is said to have succeeded to Mentelin's printing business. In this copy the capital letters, initial-strokes and paragraph marks have been supplied in red. 

Dondis (1295-1359), a native of Padua, was the municipal physician of Chioggia, a coastal town near Venice and later became professor of medicine at Padua. Dondis was also a mechanician who designed a complicated automatic clock for his native town; it was certainly one of the earliest tower clocks. Astronomy was another area in which Dondis worked; he wrote a work entitled Planetarium, a set of astronomical tables based on the Alphonsine ones but simpler and computed for the meridian of Padua. 

Dondis’ “most extensive work was the Aggregatio medicamentorum, or Promptuarium medicinae, a work which contains a large collection of medical recipes based largely on Greek and Arabic sources. It is divided into four main sections: (1) impostumes (37 chapters), (2) contusions and fractures (8 chapters), (3) wounds (12 chapters), (4) ulcers and abscesses (20 chapters). The work was completed after 1358.”–Sarton, III, p. 1670. 

This was a most successful work with a number of later editions. The Italian translation appeared under the title Herbolario volgare (eds. of 1536 and 1540). 

Binding: This combination of binding stamps is also recorded on a Venice imprint of 1477 now in Augsburg (Ink 226).

ff. [36] + folding table.","Copy from the Kings County Medical Society sales.  Dryander (also known as Eichmann) was one of he first authors to make drawings of his own dissections.  This is the first significant work devoted to the anatomy of the brain.  The first eleven plates, which first were published in 1536, depict the brain dissected according to Galen's method of starting at the top and making horizontal cuts through the skull and brain.  The work also contains four plates of the heart, chest and lungs.  Roberts and Tomlinson attribute the plates to Georg Thomas of Basil. A short work by Gabriele de Zerbis (1445-1505) on the anatomy of the fetus is also included.  The woodcut title-border is by Anton Woensam von Worms and shows the deeds of Hercules and Pyramus and Thisbe.  It was also used by Cervicornus for Dryander's edition of Abraham Ibn Ezra in 1537.

RCPE:  Dryander, also known as Eichmann, was professor of surgery at Marburg, and a friend of Vesalius. He was ""among the first anatomists who made illustrations after their own dissections"" (Choulant). The above work includes twenty plates, the first sixteen representing figures of the head and brain, and done to show successive stages of dissection. The last four show the chest and lungs. Also included is a short tract on the anatomy of the pig, traditionally attributed to Copho, and extracts from Zerbis, professor at Padua, on the anatomy of the fetus.
Dryander, who studied anatomy at Paris at the same time as Vesalius, produced in his Anatomia capitis one of the most important pre-Vesalian anatomical studies, showing by means of full-page woodcuts how he learned to dissect and display human anatomy. He was one of the first physicians in Germany to perform public dissections, and the text of Anatomia capitis is the printed record of an anatomical demonstration he gave at Marburg. Anatomia capitis was probably published in a small edition, as Dryander intended it to serve as the preliminary to a full-scale anatomy.
 
This scheme Dryander partially realized the following year when he issued his Anatomia, hoc est corporis humani dissectionis pars prior. That expanded work included 36 leaves and 19 full-age woodcuts, plus a woodcut title border. Eight of the woodcuts (one of which is repeated) are repetitions of illustrations 1-8 in the 1536 Anatomia, with the illustration numbers removed from the blocks. Another 8 woodcuts (one, Universalis figura capitis humani, repeated) are new to this work; 3 of them are signed with the monogrammed compass device used in the 1536 edition. In addition, there are 3 illustrations made up of images rearranged from illustrations 9, 10 and 11 of the 1536 Anatomia.

Gaskel-Pagel 09 for 1547 edition: A lavishly illustrated folio, an amazing display of about 275 early fifteenth-century German medical woodcuts from a range of sources. These include blocks first used in Dryander’s Anatomiae (1537); his Anatomia Mundini (1541); and works by other authors, as well as some new cuts. There are a number of sickroom and childbirth scenes, and large and small woodcuts illustrating anatomy, obstetrics and gynaecology, health and diet (many foodstuffs are shown, and a scene of a gardener tending his vegetables in a raised bed) and surgery. The surgery section includes cuts copied from Gersdorff, Feltbuch der Wundtartzney (Strasbourg, 1517) and a large number of illustrations of surgical instruments.
‘Twenty-three of the leaves, some of them with several figures, are plates taken from the above-mentioned book [Anatomia Mundini]. Two sheets are entirely new and represent (1) a figure, showing the vascular system, with heart and liver, and (2) a figure showing the cutaneous veins of the back (leaves 7 and 8). On pages 70b and 86, we, furthermore, find five smaller figures representing the brain and the tongue. These figures are the same as those of Laurentius, Phryesen, Spiegel der Artzney, Strasburg, 1518, fol., but are positively new engravings [i.e. woodcuts]. A great many other figures are nonanatomic, and were probably all done by Hans Brosamer.

pp. [24], 1–375 (i.e.379), [1].","Although Estienne received his medical degree from the University of Paris in 1542, he may have been working on the book much earlier since 3 plates are dated 1530-1532 and signed by Mercure Jollat.  Plates apparently engraved by Geoffrey Tory, five have his cross of Lorraine mark.  Charles Estienne was the younger son of Henri Estienne I.  Printed by Simon de Colines the stepfather of Charles Estienne who ran the Estienne press from the death of Henri I until Charles' brother Robert came of age.  Many of the male figures are believed to be the work of Giovanni Battista Rosso, an artist of the Fontainebleau School.  The female figures in their unusual poses have been copied from a series of prints entitled The Loves of the Gods which were engraved by Gian Giacomo Caraglio after drawings by Perino del Vaga and Giovanni Battista Rosso.  Choulant pp. 152-155. KELLETT CE. J Hist Med 12:325-336. 1957.  Herrlinger R. Clio Medica 2: 275-287. 1967.  The MacCarthy-Reagh Catalogue No. 1907 describes a copy on vellum and richly colored, perhaps the copy at the Bibliothèque Nationale.  Another colored copy was shown at the Grolier Club's exhibition of books from the Library of Duke August of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1998. The present copy is as large as the Weil copy from 1956 and the Norman copy.  This probably represents the original maximum size.  It is unpressed and in original or early boards with green silk ties.

Charles Estienne, third son of the printer Henri I Estienne, studied botany, horticulture, and classical philology before concentrating exclusively on medicine. From 1544 to 1547 he held the post of lecturer in anatomy at the Faculté de Médecine in Paris; during this same period his stepfather Simon de Colines carried out the printing of both the Latin and French editions of this anatomy, his major scientific work. Estienne was later obliged to give up his medical practice in order to manage the family printing business, but he continued to edit and compile scientific texts in such diverse areas as diet, zoology, philology, and rural economy.
The illustrations include a group of 38 cuts in books II and III in which the anatomical depictions of the internal organs are printed from separate pieces inserted into the larger blocks showing male or female figures. The sensual nature of the poses of the female figures in Book III has led to the speculation that the blocks may have been copied from a series of erotic engravings by Gian Giacomo Caraglio after drawings by Perino del Vaga, while the male figures in Book II, showing corpses reclining against trees and masonry, may be based on a series of unpublished drawings by Giovanni Battista Rosso. The insets are believed to be the work of Etienne de la Rivière.

pp. [16], 405, [3]","Choulant pp.152-155.  3 plates dated 1530-1532 are signed by Mercure Jollat.  Plates apparently engraved by Geoffrey Tory, five have his cross of Lorraine mark.  Most of the large plates were completed by 1539, but the publication of the book was delayed because of a suite between Estienne and the surgeon Estienne de la Rivière.  The two editions are the fourth and fifth illustrated anatomy works to be published, two by Berengario, the Fabrica of Vesalius being the only complete earlier ones.  Dryander's book was never completed and Hundt was not an anatomy text.  Charles Estienne was the younger son of Henri Estienne I.  The translation was done by Estienne himself.  Printed by Simon de Colines the stepfather of Charles Estienne who ran the Estienne press from the death of Henri I until Charles' brother Robert came of age.  This edition contains 2 plates of skeletons not present in the 1545 edition on A6r and A7r. There are 64 full page woodcuts (58 blocks with 6 repeats) of which 39 contain anatomical insets in the woodblocks.  It is printed throughout in italic type unlike the Latin edition.  This copy is among the tallest recorded.  Ruled in red throughout with all edges gilded and many deckled edges.
 It was the most costly book to leave the press of Simon de Colines, who was Estienne’s stepfather and the finest printer in France at the time. This book was the first published work to include illustrations of the whole external venous and nervous systems. It includes good descriptions of the clavicular joints, temporo-maxillary articulation, and the joints and ligaments of the spine, but the book excels in neurology for containing the earliest detailed illustrations of brain dissections. “His eight dissections of the brain, made in 1539, give more anatomical detail than had previously appeared, particularly the first graphical presentation of the difference between the convolutional patterns of the cerebrum and cerebellum” (McHenry).

Although this work was published two years after Vesalius’s Fabrica, it is pre-Vesalian as Estienne had begun composing it long before, possibly as early as 1530 (see below). The printing was interrupted for six years in 1539 by a lawsuit brought by the artist Etienne de La Rivière. This French edition (which, incidentally, is considerably rarer than the Latin one) is preferable for containing two full-page woodcuts which were not included in the Latin edition, bringing the total of full-page woodcuts to 64. One of the two new cuts is the famous skeleton cut on p. 13, signed by Mercure Jollat, who has also signed another eight blocks, some of which are dated 1530, 1531, or 1532. Six of the Jollat blocks and one other are also signed with the Cross of Lorraine, possibly indicating an artist from the atelier of Geofroy Tory. The first cut is signed with the initials S.R. — Stephanus Riverus, or Etienne de La Rivière, the eminent surgeon who collaborated with Charles Estienne on the drawings for the anatomical details.KELLETT CE.

(The first two editions were printed in Utrecht in 1474 and in Strasbourg in about 1475 respectively.) 

A cleric of the 4th century, Eusebius was the author of several religious works that have survived and shaped Catholic tradition. ""Eusebius' many learned publications are a history of martyrs and several apologetic and polemical works; parts of his commentaries on the Psalms and Isaiah...But Eusebius' chief fame rests on The History of the Christian Church, the most important ecclesiastical history of the ancient times, and a great treasury of knowledge about the early Church"" (Loeb). A chronological account of the development of Early Christianity, ""this was the first full length historical narrative written fårom the Christian point of view,"" and it remains an important primary source for Catholic historians (Norman).

Often called the ""Father of Church History,"" the famous bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (ca. 260 - ca. 340) was a friend and adviser of the emperor Constantine and a prolific writer of history and scriptural commentary. He is best known for three works: his epitome of universal history (covering the period from apostolic times to 324), his ""Historia Ecclesiastica"" (the first history of the Christian church).

","Single column, 45 lines plus headline in roman type. Translated by Georgius Trapezuntius (1396-1486); edited by Hieronymus Bononius (Bologni, Girolamo, 1454-1517).  Rubricated in red throughout, three- to 10-line Lombard initials painted in red.  Described by the Catholic Encyclopedia as ""a gigantic feat of erudition,"" Eusebius' ""Preparation for the Gospels"" is valued as a repository of information on paganism, preserving many extracts from classical authors that would otherwise be lost to us. Often called the ""Father of Church History,"" the famous bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (ca. 260 - ca. 340) was a friend and adviser of the emperor Constantine and a prolific writer of history and scriptural commentary. He is best known for three works: his epitome of universal history (covering the period from apostolic times to 324), his ""Historia Ecclesiastica"" (the first history of the Christian church), and the present item, a collection of knowledge and quotations from classical writers intended to prepare the mind to receive the evidences of Christianity. Composed by Eusebius during the period of the Great Persecution just prior to the legalization of Christianity, the ""Historia"" addresses an audience of learned and pious readers hesitating to embrace Christianity, and it assures them that the truth is manifest in Scripture, while the pagan schools incessantly contradict one another. The first half of the work systematizes pagan religion and mythology as well as the doctrines of the philosophical schools and goes on to recognize the similarities of Platonic and Christian beliefs, arguing that Plato's view of the Demiurge was derivative and based on a knowledge of the Hebrew Pentateuch. First printed in 1470 by Nicolas Jenson, the present work was edited by Girolamo Bologni (Latinized Hieronymus Bononius) (1454-1517), a well-known jurist, poet, and humanist. According to BMC, our printer, Michael Mazolus, was active in Treviso between 1476-81, after which time he was mainly engaged as a publisher in Venice.

The text was also edited here for the first time by Johannes Santritter. The most celebrated new addition to this edition is for the year 1457, recording the invention of printing: ""It cannot be said by any means, how much the scholars owe the Germans.  For it was Johann Gutenberg zum Iungen, nobleman of Mainz on the Rhine, who invented the art of printing around 1440 with cleverness and skill.  Nowadays it has been extended over almost all the parts of the world; by this method the whole antiquity has been brought together with little metal and can be read by our descendants in innumerable volumes.""

Henri Estienne issued to editions of the work in 1512 and 1518.

Second edition of Saint Jerome’s Latin translation of Eusebius’s Chronicon, with the continuations by him, Prosper Aquitanicus and Matthaeus Palmerius of Florence. The superbly printed Ratdolt edition, edited by Johannes Lucilius Santritter, contains an entry for the year 1440 (v3v) crediting Johannes Gutenberg with the invention of “an ingenious way of printing books.” This was one of the first acknowledgements in print of Gutenberg’s invention. The entry for 1457 on v3v contains the third published reference to Johann Gutenberg as the inventor of printing, after those in the 1474 Chronica of Riccobaldus Ferrariensis and the 1483 Supplementum chronicarum of Jacobus Philippus de Bergamo.  According to Paul Needham, this statement “influenced the account in the 1499 Cologne Chronicle, where it is stated that the printing process was ‘developed’ (‘wart undersoicht’) in the year 1440 and after, whereas printing was ‘begun’ (‘do began men tzo drucken’ in the jubilee year 1450 and after. If this statement is correct, it must refer to the period when Gutenberg was living in Strasbourg. . . . (Needham, “Prints in the Early Printing Shops,” in Parshall, ed., The Woodcut in Fifteenth-Century Europe [2009], p. 44).
Eusebius, Roman historian and Bishop of Caesarea in Palestine, composed his Chronicon or universal history around the year 310 CE. Though Eusebius’s original Greek text was lost, the work was preserved by its translation into Latin by Jerome, and by its translation into Armenian. One of Eusebius’s’ innovations in this work was a tabular system to coordinate events drawn from several distinct historiographic traditions. His use of the tabular format was influenced by the column arrangement of Origen’s Hexapla, a massive compilation of parallel texts of the Bible in tabular form, with which he was familiar. Eusebius’s Chronicon became a fundamental text for the development of historical writing in the Middle Ages.
As Anthony Grafton and Megan Williams wrote in Christanity and the Transformation of the Book (2006, p. 136), Eusebius’s Chronicon made it possible to “fix a whole world on paper” by aligning data from various strands of biblical and Near Eastern historiography. Eusebius divided his Chronicon into two parts, the Chronography and the Canons. The Chronography is a tabular list of synchonisms of Greek, Roman, and Jewish history; the Canons is a systematic chronicle of world history, following nineteen ancient states down through time, culminating in one column representing the Roman empire.
Ancient and medieval historians had their own techniques of chronological notation. From the fourth century in Europe, the most powerful and typical of these was the table. Though ancient chronologies were inscribed in many different forms, among scholars the table form had a normative quality much as the timeline does today. In part, the importance of the chronological table after the fourth century can be credited to the Roman Christian scholar Eusebius. Already in the fourth century Eusebius had developed a sophisticated table structure to organize and reconcile chronologies drawn from historical sources from all over the world. To clearly present the relations between Jewish, pagan, and Christian histories, Eusebius laid out their chronologies in parallel columns that began with the patriarch Abraham and the founding of Assyria. The reader who moved through Eusebius’s history, page by page, saw empires and kingdoms rise and fall, until all of them—even the kingdom of the Jews—came under Rome’s universal rule, just in time to make the Savior’s message accessible to all of humanity. By comparing individual histories to one another and the uniform progress of the years, the reader could see the hand of providence at work.
Eusebius created his visually lucid Chronicle just when he and other Christians were first adopting the codex, or bound book, in place of the scroll. Like other Christian innovations in book design, the parallel tables and lucid, year-by-year, decade-by-decade order of the Chronicle reflected the desire of early Christian scholars to make the Bible and the sources vital for understanding it available and readily accessible for quick reference. The Chronicle was widely read, copied, and imitated in the Middle Ages. And it catered to a desire for precision that other popular forms—like the genealogical tree—could not satisfy (Rosenberg & Grafton, Cartographies of Time. A History of the Timeline [2010], pp. 15-16).
Eusebius’s tables continued to be brought up to date by later editors; the latest year recorded in the Ratdolt edition is 1481.","Vellum, new",215 x 165,Eusebius Caesariensis 1483-1.jpg,Eusebius Caesariensis 1483-2.jpg,Eusebius Caesariensis 1483-3.jpg,Eusebius Caesariensis 1483-4.jpg,Christopher Sokol / SF Book Fair,B4

First edition of the greatest Italian anatomical book of the sixteenth century. Rather than a complete study of the whole of anatomy, Falloppio, who was a pupil of Vesalius, designed this work as a critical commentary to his teacher's De humani corporis fabrica, correcting some of its errors and adding additional observations and details. For this reason there was no need for illustrations. In fact it was a work of great originality, in which Falloppio reported many new discoveries and observations. It was the only book published during his lifetime and the only one which can be said to be fully authentic.  Bylebyl in his article about Colombo in DSB suggests that Falloppio claimed the work was written in 1555 and was published to establish his priority over Colombo whom he succeeded in the chair at Padua.
Falloppio discovered and first described the chorda tympani, semicircular canals and the aqueduct of Falloppius, correctly described the structure and course of the cerebral vessels, and knew the circular folds of the small intestines. He enumerated all the nerves of the eye, and introduced a number of anatomical names, including cochlea, labyrinth, palate, vagina and placenta, and is best remembered for his account of the tubes named after him. He also gave excellent descriptions of the ovaries, hymen, clitoris, and round ligaments, and proved the existence of the seminal vesicles. He included an important account of the kidneys, which may antedate that of Eustachius. He also discusses primary and secondary dentition.  Vesalius replied positively to Falloppio's book with his Anatomicarum Gabrielis Falloppii observationum examen, 1564, published posthumously by his friends.

Falloppio (1523-62), the foremost Italian anatomist of the sixteenth century and rival to Vesalius, made innumerable contributions to the understanding of human anatomy. His knowledge of detailed anatomical structure of the head assisted him in advancing surgical practice in dealing with head wounds, although he himself was not a skilled surgeon (O'Malley in the DSB remarks dryly that Falloppio began the practice of surgery but displayed so little aptitude for that subject - as demonstrated by the fatal outcome of a number of his cases - that he soon thereafter abandoned it and returned wholly to the study of medicine).  
The work covers cranial anatomy, treatment of cranial fractures, injuries to the brain, convulsions and inflammations, etc. Evidencing considerable knowledge of cerebral anatomy, Falloppio was the first to describe ‘the arterial circle of vessels at the base of the human brain... He described the union of the anterior rami (corresponding to our anterior communicating arteries) to the carotid arteries’ (Garrison’s history of Neurology p 58).Besides elucidating Hippocratic texts on brain anatomy, Fallopppio corrects other writers, such as Aristotle, Vidius, Cornarius, and Colombo.
The work covers cranial anatomy, the structure of the cranium, treatment of cranial fractures, injuries to the brain, convulsions and inflammations, etc.  This is a rare work, and not in the standard medical bibliographies. It was reprinted in the Opuscula tria in 1569.

He stressed the importance of physicians studying the human body themselves, an idea that may have influenced his pupil, Vesalius.  The Physiologiae was first published in 1542 and was incorporated into the present work. which was a standard text throughout Europe.  It contains the first account of appendicitis including the autopsy findings.  Portrait of Fernel on verso of *3.   Dedicated to Henri II. 
The first systematic treatise on pathology, which also introduced the names for the sciences of pathology and physiology. In the second part of the above, entitled ""Pathologia"" (a term Fernel introduced), Fernel provided the first systematic essay on the subject, methodically discussing the diseases of each organ. The result was a succinct summary of the best available knowledge of organic abnormality in disease. Fernel's predecessor Benivieni, whose De abditis (1507) represents the foundation of modern pathology, had presented a collection of case histories without any attempt at a logical or methodical system. Fernel's contributions to the study of aneurysms were particularly noteworthy. He was the first to associate arterial dilatation with aneurysm and he differentiated true from false aneurysms. Fernel also attributed the cause of arterial aneurysms to syphilis, which was pandemic during the Renaissance. Although Fernel's earlier treatise, De naturali parte medicinae (1542; PMM 68), has long been considered the earliest work devoted exclusively to physiology, Fernel actually named that science ""Physiologia"" as the title to the revised edition of it which forms the first part of the Medicina. 

Within six years after his graduation from medical school Fernel became one of the most famous physicians in France. His reputation at the court of the dauphin (later Henri II) became firmly established when he saved the life of Henri's mistress, Diane de Poitiers. Fernel was however less successful with François I, Henri's father, who died of syphilis in 1547.

pp. [4], 1–132, [4]","Contemporary limp vellum, printed in italic.  Bird gives dates as 1515-1596.  Ferri taught at Naples before moving to Rome as Papal physician to Paul III.  This is the second monograph devoted to gun shot wounds.  Ferri also deals with wounds from heavy guns and cannons.  He illustrates his instrument, an alphonsinum, for removing bullets.  Unlike Paré, Maggi and Botallo,  Ferri continued to support the idea of Vigo that gunshot wounds were poisonous.  He did recommend the removal of clothing and armor from the wounds.  This work is reprinted in Gesner's Chirurgia along with Maggi's.  Ferri also published a work on the use of guiac wood for syphilis.  

Iowa: The first part of the book deals with the treatment of gunshot wounds and covers such complications as infection, compound fractures, imbedded foreign bodies, and so forth. Directions for compounding a wide variety of medications are given and Ferri's instrument for extracting bullets, the alphonsinum, is described. 

The second monograph on the treatment of gunshot wounds (Paré's being the first), which, with syphilis on which Ferri also wrote a monograph, were the two greatest medical problems of the sixteenth century. Ferri was the first to deal with injuries caused by heavy guns. He invented a surgical instrument called an ""alphonsinum"" for removing bullets, which is illustrated in three woodcuts on page 29. He advised correctly that pieces of clothing and armour left deep in a wound led to suppuration, and should be removed, but he also perpetuated the idea that gunshot wounds were poisonous. The tract on the fleshy growths on the cervix of the bladder is of particular interest to the historian of urology, and is one of the earliest on the subject. The Spaniard Andrès Laguna published a work on the same subject the year before, in 1551, which is cited as the first important work on diseases of the genito-urinary system. This tract by Ferri, which was the subject of an extensive analysis by Malgaigne, is discussed at length by Desnos, Histoire de l'urologie, pp. 99-100. Cockle, Military books, 844.

Johann Amerbach (b. c. 1440 in Amorbach, Germany; d. 25 December 1513 in Basel, Switzerland) was a celebrated printer in Basel in the 15th century. He was the first printer in Basel to use the Roman type instead of Gothic and Italian; he spared no expense in his art. Amberbach published another edition in 1507, also ff. 100.","De triplici vita; Apologia; Annotatio

Light age yellowing, occasional oil splashes to the margins of a few leaves, a very crisp, clean and well-margined copy in contemporary ruled and blind-rolled half-pigskin over oak boards, ink stain to lower pigskin with small hole, slight tear to spine at tail, original brass clasp. A handsome copy of the second Basel edition of Marsilio Ficino's (1433-99) 'Three Books on Life', dedicated to his patron Cosimo de'Medici. For the famous translator of Plato, and of the hermetic philosophers from ancient Egypt, this was a slight departure from high scholarship into the realm of popular writing that blended folk remedies with the classics, or as the author himself writes, 'Galen, physician of Bodies, and Plato, physician of souls.' The first book 'On Healthy Life' considers black bile, the cause of madness and melancholy, but as Ficino argues, the only bodily substance that engenders profound thought, and thus the origin of genius. In this way Ficino's book is not only a 'Treatise on Healthy Living for the Learned' as he calls it, but the first to defend the temperamental genius because ""it sometimes helps to be a little crazy""(Kaske cit. infr.). After arguing ""Why Melancholics are Intelligent"" Ficino's final chapters of Book 1 provide remedies for rheum, phlegm, stomach aches, and headaches: the side-affects of melancholy. The second book 'On Long Life' continues in this vein with a advice on diet, exercise, and daily habit, (sometimes suspect: 'we should avoid both continual thinking and sexual intercourse') in order to leave a happy and healthy life. The final six chapters are addressed to the elderly, with one chapter dedicated to the uses of rose-honey, probably the earliest known superfood, and another on the significance of art and music to the well-lived life. Book Three radically changes pace from treatments for the body to consultations with the stars, reading something like a New Age Self-Help Book, i.a. ""How We Should Use the Planets in Medicines"", ""Seven Ways in Which We Can Accommodate Ourselves to Celestial Things"", ""Astronomical Precautions to Be Taken in Procreating Children, In Preparing Meals, in Buildings, and in One's Dwelling Place and Clothing"". It is not only the longest of the three books, but the most controversial, as every chapter prescribes occult practices in the name of therapy, for instance instructing readers how to capture the spirits of the stars into silver or gold rings. It was this portion of De vita which put Ficino into direct conflict with the Church for the first time: although he claims he is merely interpreting Plotinus, the more blatant references to magic are not from Plotinus but from the hermetic philosophers Proclus, and especially Al-Kindi's Picatrix. From Ficino's correspondence in 1490, we know Pope Innocent VIII found inklings of heresy in the work, and he successfully petitioned his friends in Rome for help in restoring his name to favour. The book concludes with an Apologia, another preventative measure to contain the dispute with Rome that broke out after the book's publication. In it, Ficino emphasises his vocation as a priest and physician, interested in physical healing for the sake of spiritual healing, and repeats again and again that he does not approve of 'profane magic', but only 'natural magic', that of the Magi who first adored Christ at his birth. Rare in completely original condition, as here.


Three books on life, the first being the earliest treatise on the health of scholars; the second on good health and long life; and the third on astrological medicine. There are chapters on headaches, diseases of the stomach, and dietetics. The sections on melancholy are often cited.
Ficino’s father was an eminent physician in the household of Cosimo de’ Medici where the young Marsilio got his elementary education. He was also interested in natural philosophy and made considerable progress in medicine under his father’s tuition. At the age of eighteen Ficino was chosen by Cosimo for his long cherished project, the foundation of a Platonic academy. Ficino’s Latin translation of Plato into Italian (1484) became the standard text and he was also responsible for the translation of the works associated with Hermes Trismegistus known as the ‘Corpus Hermeticum’. He translated and edited many Neoplatonic writings, a number of which are included in the Aldine edition of Iamblichus of 1497.

He was a chronicler and Biblical scholar. He was born in 1434 at Solto near Bergamo where he died in 1504. His Supplementum chronicarum (1483) was a universal chronicle running to numerous subsequent editions. Amongst other things, it records Giovanni da Carignano's lost work on papal contacts at Avignon in 1306 with Ethiopian visitors. Boninus [Dobric Dobricievic] was a Croat who began priniing in Verona before moving to Brescia and later, Lyons. He was born on the island of Lastovo, 1454-1528.

Second edition of the Chronicles of the Augustinian friar from Bergamo, which are among the first productions of modern European historiography. Published for the first time in Venice two years before, the fifteen books of the Supplementum chronicarum constitute a historical-descriptive chronology of the most important facts from the creation of the world to the end of the 1470s. Characteristic feature of this work is the use of sources (altogether over one hundred) both patristic and profane. From its reading we can understand the deep knowledge of Foresti concerning the works of Dante (1265 - 1321), Petrarca (1304 - 1374) and Boccaccio (1313 - 1375), this latter a privileged source as evidenced by the recurring quotes from his Genealogia deorum. Among the other texts utilized for the drafting of the Supplementum we find the Vitae Pontificum by Bartolomeo Platina (1421 - 1481) and the Chronicon by Saint Antonino Pierozzi (1389 - 1459). True editorial success, in addition to a translation in vernacular Italian contemporary to the princeps (reprinted several times), Foresti’s work knew dozens of editions published between the 1480s and 1581. The ultimate edition, including a 16th book on the years 1480-1499 was published in 1503 under the title Novissimae hystoriarum omnium repercussiones […] quae Supplementum Supplementi Cronicarum nuncupantur (Venice, Alberto da Lessona). Foresti’s Chronicles became in turn a source for new works on world history in no time. They were used first by Hartmann Schedel (1440 - 1514) for his Liber chronicarum (or. ed. Nuremberg, Anton Koberger, 1493), then by Marco Antonio Sabellico (c. 1436 - 1506) for his Enneades (printed between 1498 and 1504). Particularly famous and appreciated are the implemented editions of the Supplementum, and among all the Italian one printed in 1554 (Venice, Pietro Boselli and Girolamo Calepino) with complementary texts by Paolo Giovio (1483 - 1552), Pietro Bembo (1473 - 1547), Jean Carion (d. 1537) and Marco Guazzo (1480 - 1556).
Entry about the invention of printing under 1458: f. 341r lists Gutenberg, Fust and Jenson. ‘Ars imprimendi libros his temporibus in Germania primum enata est: quam alii repertam asseuerant a Guthimbergo argentine: alii a quodam alio nomine Faust: alii a Nicolao Gensone praedicant.' Praise goes equally to Gutenberg, Fust and Nicolaus Jensen (who was however French).

Bernardino Benalio, who printed the first edition of 1483, borrowed most of the illustrations for this edition from Rolewinck's Fasciculus temporum. The smaller town views are for the most part close copies of the blocks used for the first Venetian edition of the Fasciculus (Georg Walch, 1479) and copied by Ratdolt for lattr editions; they include the famous woodcut of Venice, copied in reverse from the Rolewinck blocks. Original to this edition is the larger woodcut of Genoa, on f. 50, used again for Rome on f. 79, and cited by Hind as one of the earliest views of that city. The three large Biblical cuts are derived from the illustrations of Heinrich Quentell's influential Low German Bible (ca. 1478). Hind notes their stylistic resemblance to the work of Hieronymus de Sanctis, described by Essling as ""one of the most gifted artists working in Venice at the end of the fifteenth century"" (Essling 260). Colored copies of any of the early editions of de Bergamo's chronicle are rare.
Giacomo Filippo Foresti da Bergamo (1434-1520) was an Augustinian monk, known as the author of several significant early printed works. He was a chronicler and Biblical scholar. He was born in 1434 at Solto near Bergamo where he died in 1504. His Supplementum chronicarum (1483) was a universal chronicle running to numerous subsequent editions. Amongst other things, it records Giovanni da Carignano's lost work on papal contacts at Avignon in 1306 with Ethiopian visitors. Boninus [Dobric Dobricievic] was a Croat who began printing in Verona before moving to Brescia and later, Lyons. He was born on the island of Lastovo, 1454-1528. His last years were spent as the dean of the Cathedral church in Treviso. His most famous work was the illustrated Brescia Dante. 

The invention of printing appears on f. 282v under the date 1458 and mentions Gutenberg and Fust.  In the earlier and later editions Jenson's name also appears. 

LC copy is one of the earlier copies. The index, which as printed refers only to book number, has been elaborated in ms. to refer to leaf number; additional indexing in ms. on the blank side of 1st leaf.

Franco was also the first surgeon to address himself seriously to the removal of bladder stones; he gave an account of perineal lithotomy and was the earliest to describe and perform the suprapubic incision” (Norman). 

“A less well known French-born contemporary of Paré, but one who well deserves our recognition as a shining star of Renaissance surgery, was Pierre Franco (?1500-1561). He was born in Provence of humble parents and had little schooling, but was early apprenticed to a barber-surgeon. As a Protestant, he was forced to flee from France and practiced his calling in Lausanne in Switzerland, although he eventually returned to Orange in France and his major work, Treatise on Hernias, was published in Lyon in 1561, just before his death. He deplored the fact that surgeons of his day rejected the use of open operations. This was because of the risks involved in such procedures, which they would often leave in the hands of charlatans. Franco was obviously a bold surgeon who carried out a wide range of the operative procedures known at that time. He describes in great detail his method of radical surgery for strangulated hernia, devising an incision at the base of the scrotum which he claimed was less dangerous than the higher incision. He also carried out cataract surgery and plastic operations on the face and described a new method for operating on cleft lip. In the surgery for bladder stone he was equally inventive … [he was] the first surgeon to remove a bladder stone successfully via an abdominal approach” (Ellis, p. 44).

Fuchs (1501-1556) , a student of Vesalius' classmate Guillaume Rondelet, became a successful physician, a professor of medicine at the University of Tubingen, and a prolific writer in his field; his ""De historia stirpium"" (1542) was a pioneering work of botany. He ""criticized Mondino, promoted dissection, and introduced the use of Vesalius' Fabrica in his teaching, writing a two-volume commentary on it."" (Noga Arikha, Passions and Tempers: A History of the Humors, 2007, p. 147). Fuchs freely acknowledges his debt to Vesalius in the Preface which is here printed for the first time. A second edition appeared at Lyon (1551-1555). ""Although Vesalius did not receive accolades from his mentor [Sylvius] in Paris, applause did come from other quarters. For example, in 1551 Leonhart Fuchs, a professor at Tubingen, published two volumes in which he praised Vesalius before borrowing extensively from his Fabrica. To quote from the preface of his book: 'Although Galen provided no little help to anatomy, yet it is clear that he composed his account from apes and dogs rather than men, as anyone will understand if he uses his eyes as witnesses and is willing to use his hands in dissection. Among those who in our age wrote about the structure of man, Vesalius is the only one to write with exquisite care and to describe in a suitable manner, and had his commentaries not been published we should have been deprived of the true account of many parts of the human body [.] He ought to be praised for his zeal in searching out the truth.'

pp. [12], 255, [1]","First edition of a rare collection of medical treatises by the early 16th-century Verona physician Antonio Fumanelli (also called Antonius Fumanellus).  Fumanelli had a very successful practice and, according to Hirsch, was sought out by foreigners as well as local residents.  The tracts included in this volume deal with the diagnosis and cure of fevers, skull fractures, wounds and inflammations of the chest and lungs, urine retention, and balneology.

The edition is noteworthy for its 10-page preface by Hieronymus Gemusaeus (1505–1544), professor of medicine at Basel and son-in-law of Cratander,, who has the distinction of being “the earliest known reader of Vesalius’ Fabrica,” as described by the British historian of medicine Vivian Nutton, see: “An Early Reader of Vesalius’ Fabrica,” in Vesalius: Official Journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine, Vol. III, No. 2 (December 1997), pp. 73-74.  Gemusaeus’ preface, dated 1 August 1543, contains the earliest acknowledgment of Vesalius’ revolutionary work of modern anatomy, De Humani Corporis Fabrica, which had just recently been published, with a colophon dated June 1543.
            The most relevant portion of Gemusaeus’ preface reads, “Sic enim ANDREAM VESALIVM, Anatomicae disciplinae Antistitem, locos eius [i.e. Galen] permultos a caeteris antea plane ignoratos, partim explicasse, partim etiam restituisse, ex operosissimo illo de Humani corporis fabrica, a se nunc primum edito volumine, nuper cognovimus” (trans.: “We have recently discovered that Andreas Vesalius, the leading figure in the discipline of anatomy, in that work of great endeavour just published, On the fabric of the human body, has dealt with many passages in Galen that were completely unknown to most people.  Some of them he has explained, others he has restored”).
            As Nutton explains, “On August 1, in a preface to a tract on fevers by Antonio Fumanelli, and only two months after Vesalius had approved the colophon to the Fabrica, [Gemusaeus] hailed Vesalius as the leading figure in the discipline of anatomy.  In his newly published book he had dealt with many passages in Galen that were previously unknown, some he had explained, others he had restored, and, Gemusaeus went on to imply, the author must be given the greatest of respect for his important discoveries…
            “Gemusaeus’ reaction, although serving as advertising for his friend Oporinus, is interesting for several reasons.  He acknowledges immediately that the Fabrica marks a break with the past, although he interprets it, in line with Vesalius’ own rhetoric, as a correction, interpretation, and proper restoration of Galen’s anatomical enterprise.  Gemusaeus was a committed Galenist…His comment occurs in a preface to a work almost entirely dependent on Galen’s ideas and even wording. Nonetheless, he welcomes the Fabrica warmly as developing Galen’s anatomical ideas as well as bringing to light Galenic passages that had been previously unknown.”
            This book is of considerable rarity; it is interesting to note that C.D. O’Malley, in his magisterial biography of Vesalius, did not know of this book.  WorldCat locates only two copies in the U.S. (NLM and CPP).

Conjugate blanks at K7,K8,2H8 are present.   Author's letter ""To the Friendly readers..."" is dated 12 September 1563.  Some copies (STC 11529 and Wellcome) have this dated 1564.  Dedications and introductions have dates ranging from 20 May 1563 to 12 September 1563 and are from London except the date on 2A3r which is from Paddington. 

DNB: Gale was apprenticed with John Field, also a well-known surgeon, to Richard Ferris, one of the chief barber-surgeons of the time. After practising for some time in London, he served in the army of Henry VIII at Muttrell in France in 1544 (Treatise of Gunshot, p. 74 b), and there had the good sense to refuse to imperil the lives of eleven soldiers by removing bullets the lodgments of which were uncertain. In 1557 he served under Philip II of Spain at the siege of St. Quentin, and two years later was established in practice in London (Institution, p. 8 b). He was master of the Barber-Surgeons' Company in 1561, and published a volume on surgery in 1563, dedicated to Lord Robert Dudley. It contains four separate treatises. ‘The Institution of Chirurgerie,’ the first, is a sort of catechism of surgery, in which Gale and his friend Field answer the questions of a surgical student named John Yates. The second is ‘The Enchiridion of Surgery,’ a compilation on general surgery, which contains the prescription for Gale's styptic powder often mentioned in contemporary works. Its chief ingredients were alum, turpentine, arsenic, and quicklime. The third is a treatise on gunshot wounds, in which he shows that gunpowder is not a poison, and the fourth is an antidotary or collection of prescriptions. A second volume appeared in 1566 containing some translations from Latin versions of Galen, ‘A brief Declaration of the Worthy Art of Medicine,’ and ‘The Office of a Chirurgeon.’ Gale knew but little Latin, and the translations are the work of his friend Dr. Cuningham. The writings of Gale are mainly compilations, and contain few cases from his own practice. They show him to have had less mother wit than his contemporary William Clowes the elder [q.v.], and less reading than John Banister (1540-1610) [q.v.]. He died in 1587, and left a son, Thomas, also a surgeon, admitted to the guild 18 Jan. 1597",Contemporary tooled calf,150 x 100,"Gale, Thomas1563-1.jpg","Gale, Thomas1563-2.jpg","Gale, Thomas1563-3.jpg","Gale, Thomas1563-4.jpg",Nigel Phillips,C4

First edition of Linacre translation and the first separate edition of Galen's chief work on therapeutics. The work is edited by Gulielmus Bodaeus. The British Libary has the presentation copy to Henry VIII on vellum.  Prior to the appearance of this edition, the work had been known only through corrupt translations from Arabic.  Thomas Linacre (1460-1524) was the founder of the College of Physicians in 1518 and its president until his death.  

The last page AA6v has printed on it: EME FRVERE ET/VALEBIS PAN/CRATI/CE 'Profit from me and you will be as healthy as an athlete'.  Giles Barber in Thomas Linacre: A bibliographical Survey of his Works (Maddison et al. pp. 290-353) suggests that this is the printer's joke and that the type was supposed to be blank, uninked type to support the page.  Dedication copies to Henry VIII and Wolsey are in the BL.

Thomas Linacre (1460?-1524) was a physician and Greek scholar who was at the forefront of the reform of English medicine. He studied medicine in Padua, where he received his M.D. in 1496, and helped edit the Aldine editio princeps of Aristotle (1495-8). Upon his return to England, he received a M.D. at Oxford, and taught Greek privately, one of his students being Sir Thomas More. Later he was appointed physician to Henry VIII. He was instrumental in the foundation in 1518 of the College of Physicians of London (later known as the Royal College of Physicians), and was its director until his death. 
'Linacre was a medical humanist as well as one of the finest Greek scholars of his day; his major effort, therefore, was directed toward bringing to English physicians a series of classical medical texts that he considered essential and that were, in fact, superior to other medical writings published in England at that time... His very considerable Continental reputation, especially in Greek medical scholarship, was clearly recognized by Erasmus: '... owing to the studies of Thomas Linacre, Galen has begun to be so eloquent and informative that even in his own tongue he may seem to be less so'"" (DSB).

These six Galenic texts in Niccolò Leoniceno’s Latin translations and two original works by him are among the essential first steps toward modern medical practice. Here they are printed together for the first time. Having supplied Kallierges the texts for the first genuine Galenic works to be published in Greek (1500), Leoniceno undertook a series of translations of Galen and Hippocrates based on Humanist principles, personal experience and clinical observation. This effort resulted in his two essays, some 32 leaves reflecting on the practice of medicine free from slavish adherence to classical sources. Two printers collaborated over six months to produce this edition: the first ninety-two leaves came from the press of Bernardinus Vercellensis (completed 16 July 1524) and the final one hundred eighty leaves from Vitali’s (18 January 1524 [n.s. 1525]).

 by Vesalius in Gunther's 1536 edition.. In De theriaca, ad Pisonem Galen introduced the pharmacological notion that complex remedies, made up of as many as sixty components, depended for their action on the association of two opposite properties. As well, he advanced the theory that Cleopatra broke the skin of her own arm in her suicide. He described the development a panacea by Mithridates VI in the first century BC, and the idea persisted well into modern times. The de pulsus preserves the work of his Galen's predecessor, Herophilus, who amongst other discoveries identified the heart, not the arteries as previously thought, as the source of the puse.

One of the seven volumes comprising the collected works of the Greek physician Galen, published under the general title Opera omnia nunc primum in unum corpus redacta in the years 1541-1542. ""There is no name more illustrious in the whole history of medicine than that of Galen… Written in Greek, this Galenic treasure reached the Latin Western World only through Arabic translations"" (Hagelin). The present volume mainly deals with the anatomy of the human body: the nerves, the muscles, the veins etc. All the volumes were edited by the physician Agostino Gadaldini (1515-1575) from Modena. When the present edition appeared, it was presented as the ""new translation"", based mostly on earlier humanist translations of Greek manuscripts, but also with many new translations and commentaries by well-known physicians of that day. ""It is interesting to note one of Gadaldini's collaborators was Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564). He revised the translations of Galen's anatomical works, in particular the version of Anatomical procedures"" (Fortuna), which can be found in the present volume. The present copy is frequently annotated in the margins in an early hand.

Iowa: Le Coq, often referred to by his Latin cognomen of Paschalis Gallus, was a native of Poitiers where he received his medical degree in 1597. He had considerable knowledge of medicine and its literature as a student since the present work was published seven years before he completed his medical training. This work was the first attempt at bibliography to follow that of Gesner (see No. 307 ff.). The main portion of the book is an alphabetical author list of medical books which were written in Latin. Le Coq borrowed freely from Gesner and each of his entries has a brief annotation taken from Bibliotheca universalis. Following this section of over 1200 authors, Le Coq classifies his bibliography and lists medical writers who wrote works in French, Italian, German, as well as those who wrote commentaries on Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and Dioscorides. He concludes the book with lists of medical authors who wrote about such subjects as surgery, anatomy, botany, therapeutics, plague, and syphilis. His work was an important contribution to the development of medical bibliography because it was the first general bibliography of medicine to provide useful information with each entry. Le Coq's work is here bound together with Spach's Nomenclator scriptorum medicorum (see No. 390). The individual responsible for having them bound together must have appreciated the complementary nature of Le Coq's author approach and Spach's subject arrangement.",Blind Stamped Pigskin,159 x 100,"Gallus, Paschalis ( Lecocq, Pascal)1590-1.jpg","Gallus, Paschalis ( Lecocq, Pascal)1590-2.jpg","Gallus, Paschalis ( Lecocq, Pascal)1590-3.jpg","Gallus, Paschalis ( Lecocq, Pascal)1590-4.jpg",Hemlock Books,E2

A guide to healthy living, dealing with such topics as sleep, exercise, sex, hygiene and drugs. Essentially, however, it is a treatise on diet with an emphasis on the qualities and properties of a great number of foods (including their cooking and preparation.) There is a great deal about drinking, drinks and especially wines. Although this was a popular rather than scholarly work, it does synthesize little known Jewish and Arabic teachings about food with more common western texts. (Simon, Bibl. Bacchica 283)

Canano's work on muscles (1541) contains the first copper engravings used in medical illustration.  First appearance of Vesalius in England and the second, after the e.p. of 1543, of the illustrations. One of the earliest illustrated books to have been issued for the benefit of surgeons through the influence of Henry VIII.  Binding by Bernard Middleton.
The introduction of Vesalius to England may have been through John Caius who returned to London in 1544.  Since he lectured on anatomy to the barber-surgeons, he may have based this on the Fabrica and Epitome since he knew Vesalius in Padua.  Geminus' work utilizes the text of the Epitome and illustrations from both works.  Later editions appeared in 1552 and in English by Nicholas Udall in 1553 and dedicated to Edward VI.  The English edition again appeared in 1559 with a new title page incorporating a portrait of Elizabeth I, the earliest known portrait of her.  This copy has the plates in the earlier state without the extra text on the arterial & venous plates.  See Donaldson, IML. The Library. 11: 89-104.2010. (Also Mortimer Italian).

Geminus, a native of Belgium, arrived in England around 1540, and introduced to the country the art of copper-plate engravings. He practiced for a while as a surgeon and was physician to Henry VIII, but was more active as an engraver. The above work was only the second English book illustrated with copper-plate engravings. (The first, also engraved by Geminus, were used in Raynalde, The byrth of mankynde.)

When John Caius, who lectured on anatomy and surgery at the Barber Surgeons’ Hall, persuaded Thomas Geminus to publish an English version of Vesalius’ Epitome (1553), the text chosen was not a translation from Vesalius but this text compiled by Vicary, lifted from the now lost edition of 1548 (Cushing, Vesalius, pp. 124–125). O'Malley in his introduction to the facsimile of the 1553 edition notes that Caius was not in England between 1539 and 1544/45 and may not been involved in the production of this work. Franciscus Vesalius alludes to him in his introductory letter in The China Root Epistle (1546) and accuses him as a plagiarist.

The woodcuts have been attributed to Hans Wechtlin (ca. 1480/1485–after 1526) based on the legend on visceral fugitive leaf. The scale of some of the illustrations give a sense of detail and emphasis.  These same woodcuts often create the image of Lilliputians operating on Gulliver.  Many of the faces are portraits of individuals and not the usual stylized representations found in works of this period.  The first printed illustrations of the brain appear as a series of small woodcuts around the border of the anatomical fugitive leaf of a cadaver.  This same leaf appeared the following year in the work of Lorenz Fries: Spiegel der Artzney.  The dissection was performed by Wendelin Hock von Brackenauat Strasbourg on a hanged criminal (Ch. 12 fol. 13v).  Carlino comments that this is the only fugitive sheet in which the subject is depicted as a cadaver, and certainly the only one with such specific details about the dissector.  Although crude they give the sense of an actual dissection.  This is perhaps the tallest copy extant.  The fugitive leaves have been repaired but are the original sheets.

Essays to Honor Walter Pagel by Stannard, J: Botanical Nomenclature in Gersdorff's Feldtbüch der Wundartzney.  1: 87-103.  The work is divided into 4 tracts.  The first I-XIX is a summary of anatomy and a Roman calendar with signs of the zodiac to guide bleeding of the patient.  The anatomy is derived from Albucasis, Guy, Lanfranck and Mondino as well as Galen. The second tract (XIX-LXX) is devoted to treatment of wounds including medical treatment including a section on seditiva with a recipe for spongia somnifera and opium.  The third tract (LXX-LXXXII) deals with leprosy.  The fourth tract (LXXXIII-XCV) consists of three separate Latin-German vocabularies.","Contemporary Blind Stamped Calf, with Hardware",280 x 190,"Gersdorff, Hans von1517-1.jpg","Gersdorff, Hans von1517-2.jpg","Gersdorff, Hans von1517-3.jpg","Gersdorff, Hans von1517-4.jpg",Thomas-Scheler/ LA Book Fair,C7

Iowa: Gersdorff was a military surgeon who had gained wide experience during the course of some forty years of campaigning and was an expert in the care and treatment of battlefield injuries. His work is divided into four books which treat of anatomy, surgery, leprosy, and glossaries of anatomical terms, diseases, and medications. Gersdorff emphasized a well-founded knowledge of anatomy because the surgeon was frequently called upon to deal with extensive bodily trauma. He derived his anatomy primarily from the Arabic authors and works of Guy de Chauliac (see No. 107 ff.). The surgical portion of the work was devoted to wound surgery and covers in some detail the methods he employed for extracting foreign objects and amputating limbs. He used a tourniquet to control bleeding when amputating and covered the stump with the bladder of a bovine or swine to help control postoperative hemorrhaging. He also included information on various remedies and medications that might be employed by the surgeon. Of special interest are the sedatives and analgesics, although he appears not to have employed them in his practice. The section on leprosy is given over largely to remedies for a disease he did not believe could be cured. The final part of the book consists of a series of Latin-German glossaries containing anatomical terms, diseases, and some 800 simples of animal, mineral, and plant origin. The book contains many woodcuts, attributed to Hans Wechtlin (b. ca. 1480), which depict anatomy, surgical operations, and surgical instruments and devices. Herrlinger comments that ""The illustrations . . . belong to the early phase of 16th-century medical illustration and represent one of its high points"" (History of medical illustration. London, 1970. p. 142). The practical nature of Gersdorff's book and its fine illustrations caused it to become very popular and it was frequently referred to, widely quoted, and freely plagiarized. The work went through at least twelve editions between the time of its first publication in 1517 and the early seventeenth century. The book also appeared in several Latin and Dutch editions.",New Calf,208 x 158,"Gersdorff, Hans von1526-1.jpg","Gersdorff, Hans von1526-2.jpg","Gersdorff, Hans von1526-3.jpg","Gersdorff, Hans von1526-4.jpg",H.

It was abridged by Conrad Wolfhart (Lycosthenes 1518-1561) in 1551 (Basel: Oporinus); this was followed by another abridged version in 1555 by Gesner's friend Josias Simler (1530-1576)(Zurich: Froschauer). Robert Constantinus published an index to the Bibliotheca in Paris in 1555; An enlarged edition, also edited by Simler, appeared in 1574 and contains approximately 35,000 titles.  Finally Froschauer published yet another enlarged edition of Simler's work in 1583, edited by Johann Jakob Fries.  The book is dedicated to Leonardus Beckh whose coat of arms appears on *7r.  Among the medical writers cited are Vesalius (l. 42), Berengario (l. 352), Geminus, Gersdorff, Tagault, Vidius, Estienne, Brunschwig and Paracelsus (l. 614v).  This contains the earliest bibliographic listing of the works of Vesalius.  Included are the 1537 and 1539 editions of Rhazes by Winter, the 1539 Epistola Docens and the Fabrica.  The contents are summarized and the physical description of the number of gatherings in quarto or folio is given.  Gesner concludes the section on Vesalius by commenting that he was 28 years old when he wrote the Fabrica.
The entire bibliography consists of this volume, Pandectarum (1548), Partitiones Theologicae (1549) and the Appendix Bibliothecae (1555).

The first subject bibliography. Conrad Gesner (1516-65), a Swiss natural historian, was crowned by Dibdin as the “father of bibliography”. After touring libraries in Germany and Italy, he, at the age of 25, decided to produce a bibliography of all the printed books ever published in Greek, Latin and Hebrew.  In 1545 his Bibliotheca Universalis was published which included more than 12,000 items with his commentary. This work, the Pandectarum, followed in 1548 classifying these books according to subject matter into categories.  Only Books I-XIX were published.  Book XX on medicine never appeared.  Book XXI on theology was published separately in 1549.  Each book is dedicated to a famous printer and lists many of the books published by him.

pp. [40], 1104, [12] With 83 large woodcuts","First edition of the first volume of Gesner's history of animals, one of the greatest zoological works of all times, which can be ""considered the basis of modern zoology"" (Horblit). Gesner completed this vast work in just seven years, referring to all literature available to him and corresponding with more than 50 scholars all over Europe to gather the latest insights and discoveries. He conscientiously lists all his sources in true bibliographic fashion in the various introductions. This volume treats the mammals only. Of the representation of an Indian rhinoceros, Gesner reports that it was copied by his draftsman from Dürer's woodcut on a broadside which described the first such animal shown in Europe. Dürer's rendition of the strange animal is rather stylized and reminiscent of a suit of armour. Gesner collected the pictorial material himself and contributed a number of drawings of his own. The cuts were probably executed at Froschauer's workshop. The repeatedly occurring monogram ""FO"" is thought by Leemann-van Elck to stand for Franz Oberreiter from Strasbourg.  The woodcuts are thought to be cut after paintings by Lukas Schan, some of which are in the Felix Platter collection in the library of the University of Basel.  The illustrations tend to be scientific and naturalistic, and Leemann-van Elck considers it a very important monumental work from a xylographic, typographic, and scientific point of view.  The indices at the front give the names of the animals in Latin, Greek, German French, Spanish, Italian and English.  There are many neat annotations in several hands on the fly leaves as well as in the margins.  Signatures b4v- g1r contain a Catalogi Authorum, an early bibliography of natural history.  

RCPE: Konrad Gesner, one of the great polymaths of the 16th century, studied at Basle, Paris, and Montpellier, became professor of Greek at Lausanne, and finally professor of medicine and town physician at Zurich. His numerous writings covered a vast range of topics, and those on botany, zoology, medicine, and pharmacology, became standard reference works throughout Europe for over 200 years. He also made important contributions to classical philology, theology, and the study of linguistics. The above work has been called ""the foremost zoological work of the Renaissance period and the starting point of modern zoology"" (Lilly).

The woodcuts of the De avium are the second important suite of ornithological iconography, being roughly contemporary with those of Belon published the same year. They are the precursors of many of Aldrovandi's illustrations, many of which were copied from Gessner. They were drawn by Lukas Schan, and cut by ŒF.O.¹, possibly Franz Oberreiter.  Thirty of the original paintings survive in the Felix Platter collection in Basel.  The oviparous quadrupeds volume, the second volume of the Historia animalium to appear, also contains a supplement to the viviparous quadrupeds.

ff. [10], 408 (i.e. 406), [2], [20] ","First edition of this collection of surgical texts, assembled and edited by Conrad Gesner, who contributed the section De medicinae chirurgicae praestantia et antiquitate. This is a history and bio-bibliography of surgery and surgeons, one of the first of its kind, and covers some 150 authors. It is the only medical bibliography by Gesner since Book XX of the Pandectarum was never published.  The other texts in the volume include Guido Guidi's versions of Galen, Oribasius and Heliodorus, Jean Tagault's De chirurgica institutione, works by Houllier, Jacopo Dondi, Mariano Santo, Angelo Bolognini, Biondo, and Hans Lange, as well as Bartolomeo Maggi's and Alfonso Ferri's treatises on gunshot wounds.

The woodcuts include skeletal illustrations taken from Vesalius, depictions of field surgery from Gersdorff, and reduced versions of the figures in Guido Guidi's Chirurgia. The blocks were cut by Jos Murrer.
See Heirs of Hippocrates 309 for detailed summary.  Indistinct signature on titlepage: ?ex libris/ Saucerotte/ 1786.  The date is appropriate for the surgeon Nicolas Saucerotte (1741-1814). Thoma-Scheler has a copy signed by Rheticus for about $25000 in the 70's.  Goldschmidt Cat. 29: 92 (1932) offered a copy of Bibliotheca Universalis which was a presentation copy from Froschauer to Rheticus for £32.

ff. [6], 184, [14]","First edition of Josias Simler's scarce authorized abridgement, with his own additions, of Gesner's Bibliotheca, one of the epochal works in the annals of bibliography. An earlier unauthorized abridgement had been prepared by Lycosthenus and was published as a quarto by Oporinus in 1551.  Simler (1530-1576), one of Gesner's friends and his first biographer, was professor of theology at Zurich where he also taught mathematics and astronomy.  Under Vesalius the second edition of the Fabrica is included with the date 1554.  Spach also listed this edition of Vesalius as 1554.  As expected there is a long entry for Gesner including Historia Animalium published in 1555.  Chirurgia of 1555 is included in the 4 pages of additions compiled by Gilbert Cognato and the inclusion of Vidius in the work is noted under Vidius as is Maggi.

Bound after the Gesner are three further works: 
1. Musculus, Andreas. Compendium Doctrinae Christianae collectum (Frankfurt an der Oder: J. Eichorn, 1573). 
2. Barbarossa, Christoph. Analysis Catechetica (Hamburg: J. Lucius, Jr., 1595). 
3. Balcke, Joachim. Tabulae de Ratione dicendi (Rostock: A. Ferber, 1591).

This is probably the dedication copy of this work with Fugger's presentation inscription to his Latin secretary Hieronymus Wolf.  See entry for Book II.  There are 217 woodcuts of birds cut after paintings by Lukas Schan or Schroen (fl. 1526-1550) some of which survive as part of the Felix Platter collection in the Basle University Library. This suite of woodcuts contains the first naturalistic representations of the animal kingdom, and effectively heralds the birth of zoological book illustration. They are the archetypes of much subsequent animal illustrations, even into the 18th century. The third part, concerning birds, of Gessner's zoological encyclopedia.  The indices of names of birds are in 10 languages. Gesner's portrait  (7.1 x 9.9 cm) by Jos Murer, one of the principle illustrators of Historia animalium, is on the verso of the title page and shows him at 39 in 1555.

""The volume on birds was published in 1555, and contains 217 accounts of birds, illustrated with a woodcut for each species. The text includes external appearance, anatomy, distribution, habits, mythology and literature. Gessner included fabulous birds, but was not naive in this respect, and made it clear exactly what they were. He deserves the credit for having seen the need for a popular book on birds 'for the people', and was the subject of many laudatory accounts and bibliographies. However, there is no doubt that this monumental work had a great influence on writers in the coming centuries. Gesner tried to include every known animal, and these are arranged alphabetically. He is believed to have been the first person to make a collection of natural history objects for the purposes of study"" (Walters, 'A consice history of ornithology' pp. 26-27).

The First Printed Catalogue of a Portion of a Public Library 1575:
Hieronymus Wolf, humanist, and librarian to Johann Jakob Fugger, published Catalogus Graecorum librorum manu scriptorum Augustanae bibliothecae. Wolf's slim pamphlet of only 6 leaves listed 126 Greek manuscripts presented by Fugger to the City Library of Augsburg, Fugger's native city. It may be considered the first printed catalogue of a portion of a public library.

This work subsumed all previous in its encyclopaedic coverage, and is justly considered to be the first architectural  dictionary, and the earliest vocabulary of domestic economy. De Partibus Aedium (On the Parts of the House) presents, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms of the Renaissance household. The book served as a reference work for many wealthy Italians who sought to model their villas on the ancient estates (i.a. Daniello Barbaro's estate at Maser). Contains a glossary of words used by Vitruvius and Celsus. In many ways this edition is a technical dictionary with descriptions of medical, bibliographical and paper making terms.

pp. [10], 231, [21]","A version of the Minerva printer's mark which is on the title of the first Basel edition by Rauch and Platter appears here on the last leaf. This first textbook advocating that physicians study anatomy, by the teacher of Vesalius, was first published in 1536. ( Hulst III: 4705) and revised by Vesalius in 1538.  Cushing, in writing about Vesalius, says of this 1539 edition, which was changed by Guenther but not by Vesalius,""This Basel edition of 1539 has textual and other changes from the edition of 1536, but since these were made by Guenther himself, and not by Vesalius, the book is not described."" (Cushing, p. 47.) By this time, Vesalius had edited the work for publication in Venice in 1538. Vesalius is mentioned twice in the present version, once in the text on page 30 and once in the introductory epistle to Ebulino, Archbishop of Cologne on a5. There is also an entry in the index for Vesalius for p. 30.  In the introductory letter, Guinther notes that he was assisted by Vesalius and Servetus.

Many of Vesalius’ additions were taken over, sometimes verbatim, by Guinther in his own revision of 1539, which included a new description of the neck and spine muscles.  O'Malley discusses some of these in detail in his 1964 biography of Vesalius.

Vallée; 2 page poem by Paré.  19 full page engraved anatomical plates. Guillemeau was physician to 3 French kings, Charles IX, Henri III and Henri III, and son-in-law of Paré.  He is noted particularly for his contributions to dentistry, ophthalmology, and obstetrics. His Tables anatomiques, based upon his earlier Six tables anatomiques (1571; with Michel de Saint-Pierre), was intended for French surgeons unlearned in Greek or Latin. In later editions, the work was combined with Guillemeau's La chirurgerie françoise. According to Mortimer, Guillemeau's anatomical plates were copies in reverse of the engravings in the Venice, 1560 edition of Valverde's Anatomia del corpo humano, which in turn were copies, with additions, of the Vesalian anatomical woodcuts. The magnificent engraved title is an excellent example of Baroque architectural title design (1594). 

This is the copy offered by Weil 30: 61 (1962) for £245.  He identified Demours as the oculist to Louis XVIII and Charles X  but it is more likely that the date of (18)28 is Antoine Pierre Demours (1762-1836) son of Pierre Demours (1702-1795).  Demours fils was ophthalmologist to Ludwig XVIII and Karl X of Bavaria.  He published Traité des Maladies des Yeux in 1818. (P&C 04: $4750). See Albert 545-548.

Along with Della Croce, this is a fine example of 16th century neurosurgery in contemporary setting and dress.  The surgical work of Guillemeau was reissued in 1598 and combined with his anatomical plates of 1586.  The 1598 edition appears in many collections.  English and Dutch editions were printed in 1597 and 1598 at Dordrecht.   This edition appears to be quite rare when it is complete.  Guillemeau was Paré's son-in law as well as the translator of his collected works into Latin.  He is best remembered for his work on diseases of the eye.  Guillemeau was provost of the College of Surgeons and surgeon to Charles IX, Henri III and Henri IV.

Second edition in Latin of Guy de Chauliac's Chirurgia magna. Like the 1498 Latin editio princeps, the 1499 edition adds medical and surgical works by Leonardo Bertapaglia, Bruno da Longobucco, Lanfranc de Milan, Rolando, Ruggiero, Theodoricus and Bonaventura de Castello; unlike the earlier edition, it also contains treatises on the eyes by Jesus filius Hali and Canamusali de Baldach. Guy de Chauliac studied medicine and surgery in Montpellier and Paris, and served as the personal physician to Popes Clement VI, Innocent VI and Urban V. His Chirurgia magna, written in the early 1360s, remained a standard surgical text up to the time of Ambroise Paré. The work is a compilation of the best medical ideas of the time, containing very little original material and drawing heavily upon the classical Greek and Arabic medical writings; however, Guy often used his own experience as a basis for criticism of these canonical texts. The book's seven chapters cover a broad range of subjects, from cancers to wounds to dentistry. Of particular interest is Guy's insistence that surgeons study anatomy (""the surgeon who is ignorant of anatomy carves the human body as a blind man carves wood""), and his description, in his chapter on abscesses and tumors, of the Avignon plagues of 1348 and 1360, which he blamed upon the Jews and an evil conjunction of the planets. The book's preface (""Capitulum singulare"") is an essay on the general facts that Guy thought all surgeons should know, including the liberal arts, diet, surgical instruments and operating methods; it also contains a brief history of medicine in the form of notes on earlier physicians and surgeons. Although probably written in Latin, Chirurgia magna was first published in French (1478), with Italian, Catalan, Spanish and Latin editions soon following.

Third edition in Italian, the first in the 16th cent., preceded only by the incunable editions of 1480 and 1493.  Guy de Chauliac (c. 1300-1368), considered one of the great masters of the surgery, began his study of medicine in Toulouse before going to study in Montpellier, the center for medical knowledge in 14th century Europe. He was then in Paris between 1315 and 1320, and around 1325, he became a Master of Medicine and Surgery. After receiving his degree, he went to Bologna to study anatomy under Nicola Bertuccio, from whom he may have learned surgical techniques; subsequently he became pontifical physician of Clement VI in Avignon. Chauliac's seminal work on surgery, Chirurgia magna, was finished in 1363 in Avignon. In seven volumes, the treatise covers anatomy, bloodletting, cauterization, drugs, anesthetics, wounds, fractures, ulcers, special diseases, and antidotes. He describes surgical techniques such as intubation, tracheotomy, and suturing. Garrison-Morton: “The most eminent surgeon of his time; his authority remained for some 200 years … He distinguished the various kinds of hernia from varicocele, hydrocele, and sacrocele, and described an operation for the radical cure of hernia. Chauliac discussed the anatomy of the teeth and their eruption. He also listed the maladies to which the teeth are subject, and their cures, including hygienic rules which for the most part remain true today, He described the double-lever pelican and its method of use, he also records how surgeons were using botanic methods to prevent their patients from feeling pain during operations” [...] it is the greatest surgical text of the time”.

The book, which was originally written about 1363, includes his views on fractures, and gives an excellent summary of the dentistry of the period. It is the greatest surgical text of the time (G&M). This collection includes both books of Lanfranc, the founder of French surgery. All of these works were originally written between the twelfth and the fourteenth centuries, and comprise some of the earliest surgical works of modern times, including the earliest writing on surgery in the West, that of Roger of Parma, which formed the real basis of the medieval surgery of Italy ((Baas, p. 299). Most of them were first published in this collection, with some variation in additions or omissions, in 1498.

Title page with printer's device of a scholar under an olive tree in imitation of Henri Estienne's. Large medallion portrait of the editor Laurent Joubert repeated at recto of c2 and **8, over 50 detailed illustrations of surgical instruments.

First edition of Joubert's translation of the most comprehensive survey of surgical knowledge of the 14th century, written by the most influential surgeon of the time, bound here with a first edition of Joubert's annotations on the work. The Grande Chirurgie draws from no less than 88 authorities, most prominently Galen, as well as heavily from Arabic sources such as Avicenna. The work begins with a discussion of areas of knowledge Chauliac believed surgeons must have prior to successfully treating patients; the liberal arts including astronomy, dietary needs, surgical instruments, and the history of the profession. This is followed by seven tracts: on anatomy, tumors and abscesses and the airborne diseases which cause them, open wounds, ulcers, fractures and dislocations of the bone, pathologies that affect specific parts of the body such as leprosy, and finally a list of about 750 medical remedies and antidotes. It is prefaced by an extraordinarily comprehensive alphabetic index of diseases, medical conditions, and treatments.

Laurent Joubert (16 December 1529, Dauphiné, France - 21 October 1582, near Montpellier, France) was a French physician. He travelled to Montpellier at the age of 21 to study medicine, and became a student of Guillaume Rondelet, the chancellor of the Medical Faculty at the University of Montpellier. Soon after Rondelet's death in 1556, Joubert succeeded him as chancellor. He was later summoned by Catherine de' Medici, the queen consort of France, to be her personal physician. Joubert went on to become one of the physicians to Henry III of France. Joubert was married to Louise Guichard, the sister of the physician to the King of Navarre.","Contemporary limp vellum, yapp edges, spine repaired",173 x 105,Guy de Chauliac (Laurent Joubert) 1580-1.jpg,Guy de Chauliac (Laurent Joubert) 1580-2.jpg,Guy de Chauliac (Laurent Joubert) 1580-3.jpg,Guy de Chauliac (Laurent Joubert) 1580-4.jpg,Christopher Sokol/ LA Book Fair,N2

Although, following Leland, Brito is often described as English, there seems no reason to doubt that the author of this work was the Franciscan friar, commended for his learning, met by Salimbene de Adam in Vienne and Lyon in 1249, and that his name denotes his origin in Brittany (DNB). The Vocabularium was his most important and influential work and provided explanations, derivations -- sometimes from the Greek or Hebrew -- and etymologies for the most difficult words in the Vulgate Bible. All were arranged in alphabetical order and, demonstrating his wide knowledge, were drawn from a range of classical, patristic and medieval writers. This dictionary had a wide circulation and was regarded as an essential scholarly tool: already in 1284 it was one of the three texts that Archbishop John Pecham instructed Merton College, Oxford to buy to be kept to be chained to a table in the library and thereby available for the instruction of poor and orphaned members of the founder's family. Although at least 130 manuscript copies survive we can find no record of one being offered for auction. The first printed edition was issued in Ulm around 1476 under the name Henricus de Hassia (Goff H-37).","Vocabularius Bibliae §

The woodcut, usually shaved to fit the page size, survives in our copy in a perfect condition and impression. The elaborate black background includes a cartouche at the top with a satyr and a ram, and at the bottom a mythological scene. the large vignette within the frame shows Herodotus receiving laurel. the debate about the attribution of these woodcuts is still open: the unknown “master of the border of the Herodotus” is sometimes connected with the Poliphilus master (Essling) or with Simon Perigrini (Pollard).  It appears in several other later works including a Paris edition of Boccaccio of Des nobles malheureux of 1538.

Born in the Persian-controlled city of Halicarnassus, Herodotus was the author of a nine-book account of the wars between the Greek states and Persia (490–479 B.C.E.) and of Persian gods and kings, geographies, and ethnic origins of conquered populations, enlivened by digressions on noteworthy personalities, local lore, rumors, and sex. On completion, it was the longest prose work in Greek up to its time and remains the earliest major historical narrative to have survived from antiquity. Herodotus’s historiai (investigations) were based on exhaustive research and far-flung travels throughout the Hellenic realm, the Persian Empire, and beyond to the Scythian Black Sea coast. In his later years, Herodotus became renowned for paid public recitations of his work-in-progress and was alleged to have gained both fame and fortune by extolling Athens at the athletic games in Olympia. Long considered the first true historian, Herodotus was, above all else, interested in telling a compelling story.

Lorenzi Valla (1407–1457), one of the most influential of the early Renaissance humanists, produced a number of corrected Latin translations of sacred and classical Greek texts, including Aesop’s fables and the histories of Thucydides (1452) and Herodotus (1457), both commissioned by Pope Nicholas V.

The 1494 edition of Valla’s translation of Herodotus’s Historiae, open here to its title page, is a rare instance of an early printed edition of an ancient text adorned by any illustration. Within the white-on-black woodcut frame is a central panel showing Herodotus crowned with laurel by Apollo in a fifteenth-century–style study. The scene below depicts the Near Eastern mother of the gods, Cybele, with her lover Attis and other figures and includes a loom bearing the initials S C P I, thus possibly identifying the designer of the woodcut as the obscure engraver Stefano Pellegrini da Cesena.",Reversed calf,318 x 210,Herodotus1494-1.jpg,Herodotus1494-2.jpg,Herodotus1494-3.jpg,Herodotus1494-4.jpg,"Mediolanum/ NY Book Fair

pp. [84], I–DCCXXXIII ( i.e. DCCXXXII), [2].","First collected edition of 80 Hippocratic works translated from Greek into Latin by Marco Fabio Calvo (d. 1527 in the sack of Rome).  The first edition of the Greek texts was published in 1526.  The work is dedicated to Clement VII.   Calvo was physician to Pope Clement VII and also wrote about ancient Rome.  'Hippocrates first established an empirical system of medicine based on a combination of bedside experience and a collation of the many individual data which then formed the basis of clinical teaching. The clinical descriptions of fevers, phthisis, peurperal convulsions, epilepsy and other disorders have remained classics and no such records were kept again for over a thousand years. 'The treatise on surgery includes treatment of dislocations and fractures, trephining the skull, descriptions of surgical instruments, rules on public health and diagnosis, a famous work on the brain, on the theory of the four humours, and many others. Laennec specifically acknowledges his debt to the Hippocratic writings in relation to his invention of the stethoscope. The most celebrated section of all is probably the ""Aphorisms."" 'The ideal of the humane and learned physician originates with Hippocrates, and the ""Hippocratic Oath"" still remains the classic expression of the duties, ethics and moral standards of the medical profession' (Printing and the mind of man 55)' 
This edition publishes the Latin translation from the Greek made by Marco Fabio Calvo, who had prepared his own Greek manuscript in 1512 by collating a fourteenth century manuscript in his possession with a twelfth-century codex which remains one of the oldest and most important Hippocratic manuscripts. Both manuscripts, along with Calvo's recension, survive in the Vatican Library. Greek text published in 1526 by Aldus utilised another version of the Hippocratic texts.  Calvo also published Aniquae Urbis Romae (ep 1527, 1532 & 1556).

Iowa: Leonhart Fuchs (see No. 241 ff.) was a brilliant student and received his baccalaureate degree at Erfurt, when only seventeen and a master's degree from Ingolstadt in 1521. He continued at Ingolstadt and three years later graduated in medicine. In 1535, after several years of practice and teaching, he became professor of medicine at Tübingen where he remained until his death. He was opposed to the study of Arabic writers on medicine arguing that the classic medical authors should be read and studied in the original Greek. As a result, he made many translations of the great classical authors and prepared numerous commentaries on their writings. The present volume is his commentary on Hippocrates' Aphorisms in which he includes not only his own commentary but often the comments and notes of Galen (see No. 36 ff.). The text of each aphorism is given in Greek as well as Latin and the commentary is in Latin.

UGO BENZI (c. 1370-1439), called Hugh of Siena, was Professor of Medicine at Siena, then at Bologna and at Parma, and appears to have given lectures at the Sorbonne. Returning to Italy, he was called by Nicholas III to Ferrara, where he took part in the celebrated Council of 1417. He was perhaps the best interpreter of the ancient medical writers amongst his contemporaries. His Consilia are of interest on account of their clinical reports.

Manca a Osler, Wellcome, Cushing, Waller e a quasi tutte le grandi biblioteche mediche. 

Contains 83 consilia by Benzi and two by other authors.  The 1496-1499 edition provides another 27 consilia.

ff. [120]","The Anthropologia is among the earliest printed works to contain anatomical illustrations.  There are 5 full page woodcuts, 2 of which depict the brain, ventricles and cranial nerves.  Smaller woodcuts in the text depict other organs including the sutures of the skull.  The woodcut of the brain is preceded by incunable editions of Albertus Magnus, Ludovicus of Prussia's (1498) and Johann Peyligk (1499) with schematic illustrations of the cerebral ventricles and the functions residing within them.  The ventricular plate appears here twice and is certainly the basis of Dryander's more refined illustration of 1536 and 1537.  This is a large copy with deckle edges on many leaves.
 It contains the most complete representation of all the viscera published up to that time. The five full-page woodcuts consist of two identical representations of the human head, an entire body, a hand with chiromantic markings and the internal organs of the thorax. The smaller cuts distributed throughout the text include plates of the stomach, intestines, eye and cranium. Even though by this time dissection had been practiced in Europe for about two hundred years, these illustrations, by an unknown artist, are schematic devices rather than drawings done at a dissection. They do not appear to have been intended to correspond to anatomical reality. For example a woodcut of the body includes the names of all the external parts but makes no attempt to equate the anatomical terms with the parts they describe. Woodcuts like these are more like a visual way of listing the main organs, such as a table in a modern book might indicate relationships.
Like most of his contemporaries, Hundt believed in the influence of the stars on the human body, and incorporated remarks on chiromancy into his text. He also subscribed to the Galenic notion of the seven-celled uterus. Hundt's Antropologia provides a clear picture of late fifteenth-century anatomical concepts prior to the work of Berengario da Carpi.",Blind Stamped Pigskin-Middleton,210 x 152,"Hundt, Magnus1501-1.jpg","Hundt, Magnus1501-2.jpg","Hundt, Magnus1501-3.jpg","Hundt, Magnus1501-4.jpg",Swann,B4

ff. [57]","Second edition, FIRST ILLUSTRATED EDITION. The series of woodcuts constitutes the earliest printed representation of the constellations. The woodcuts, attributed to Santritter, derive from medieval manuscript sources and depict figures in medieval European costume. The text is attributed to Hyginus the mythographer and based on Greek sources, particularly Aratos' Phaenomena. Blending myth and science, the work explains the basics of astronomy, the 42 constellations and the zodiac. The text was first published in an unillustrated edition in Ferrara in 1475.
Dowling: FIRST ILLUSTRATED EDITION of Hyginus’ “Poeticon Astronomicon”, illustrated with 47 half-page woodcuts of the constellations and the planets personified. The text is set in a pleasing Gothic. The text of Hyginus was first published in an unillustrated edition at Ferrara in 1475.The “Poeticon Astronomicon” (more correctly, the “Astronomica”) is an ancient Roman work on the constellations chiefly based on the work of the Greek scientist Eratosthenes (3rd c. B.C.). The work was traditionally attributed to the first century writer C. Julius Hyginus, the Director of the Palatine Library under the Emperor Augustus, but the extant text is now believed, based on stylistic analysis, to be an abridgement of Hyginus’ work made in the late second century. The fact that the order of the constellations in the poem follows precisely that of Ptolemy’s “Almagest” further strengthens the casgrapaldi
e for a second century date. A remarkable aspect of Hyginus’ text is his insistence on the use of astronomical models, in particular, a celestial globe, as an aid to teaching or explaining astronomical principles and phenomena, particularly for “discussions on the inter-relationships between the constellations and especially between the constellations and the celestial circles.”(Lippincott p.4)Like Manilius’ “Astronomicon” and Proclus’ “Sphaera” (a text that Hyginus sought to improve upon), the “Poeticon Astronomicon” was of special interest to early astronomers –including Copernicus- who desired accurate editions of ancient texts from which they might derive a clear understanding of the astronomical knowledge of the Romans and Greeks, thereby establishing a firm foundation upon which to undertake astronomy’s “renewal”.One of the chief interests in Ratdolt’s edition of Hyginus lies in the illustrations of the constellations, the first such illustrations to appear in a printed book. These images derive from medieval sources such as those found in manuscripts and paintings –though a specific source has not been identified. The figures appear in medieval European costume and, in the words of Redgrave, “There is a vigour and quaintness about these woodcuts which merit recognition.” Hyginus gives detailed accounts of the myths associated with each of the constellations, and these myths served as source material for artists in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, one of the most famous examples of the text’s influence being the splendid ceiling painted around 1511 by Peruzzi for Agostino Chigi in the Sala di Galatea of the Villa Farnesina (See Förster, Farnesina-Studien 1880, p. 40). In many instances these medieval European, often mythological, constellation figures differed notably from those used by Ptolemy and his Islamic successors ... Several stylistic conventions, first published in Ratdolt's woodcuts, endured for several centuries, both in the numerous editions of Hyginus and in the various maps derived therefrom.The Contents of Hyginus’ “Poeticon Astronomicon”Hyginus tells us that he intends to give a better description of the celestial sphere than Aratus had done in his “De Sphaera”. Book I gives a brief overview of the cosmography of the universe, the celestial sphere, the Earth and its zones, and the Zodiac. Book II is a compendium of myths related to the constellations, the five planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter) as well as the Sun, Moon, and Milky Way.Book III is Hyginus’ star catalogue. It is in this book that Ratdolt’s woodcuts appear. “Each constellation is described (in the same order as in Book II) in terms of its location relative to the surrounding constellations and the celestial circles, with some indications being given as to the overall shape and disposition of the figure. In addition, Hyginus provides a list of the positions of the stars relative to the figure itself, describing the placements in terms of ‘left’ and ‘right’ and ‘above’ and ‘below’, in line with the tradition of descriptive star catalogues. Moreover, he tends to list the stars from the top of a figure downwards (or from the head to the feet, regardless of the orientation of the figure within the sky). This is very different from the way the more mathematically oriented astronomers such as Hipparchus or Ptolemy describe the constellations.“Book IV returns to the subject of cosmology and to astronomical topics, such as the position of the constellations on each celestial circle, the unequal division of the night and day and the risings and settings of the constellations relative to the signs of the zodiac. He discusses the movements of the Sun and the Moon and the five planets and touches upon Pythagorean notions of the harmony of the spheres.” (Lippincott, Kristen “The textual tradition of the De Astronomica of Hyginus”, pp. 10-11)

Council of Trent (1545-1563): Pope Paul III (1534-1549); Pope Julius III (1550-1555);  Pope Pius IV (1559-1565).  The northern Italian city of Trent was the venue of an ecumenical council at three meetings held in 1545-9, 1551-2 & 1562-3. It helped to define more precisely the doctrines of the Roman Church in opposition to those of the Reformation. This is evident in the Council's rejection of the protestant views on original sin and in the reaffirmati on of the doctrine of transubstantiation. Although papal autocracy was strengthened since the Council depended on the Pope's consent to validate decrees, the Council ultimately secured the future spaxiritual efficiency of the Roman Church, as when provision was made for the establishmnet of seminaries for the training of the clergay in every diocese.

The work presents the Ten Rules which until 1897 defined the books that should be banned.  Under each letter, books and authors are divided into three classes: authors condemned with all their writings; certain prohibited books of authors; and pernicious books by anonymous authors.  The principle of a list of forbidden books was adopted at the Fifth Lateran Council in 1515, then confirmed by the Council of Trent in 1546.

The present Catalogue of Prohibited Books supplements and repeats the Index published by the Council of Trent (1564). It contains three specific types of condemned literature: works of authors previously censored, books forbidden by the Index and anonymous writings antagonistic to Sacred Doctrine. Such forbidden works found to be extant were to be burned within three months; their printing, sale and circulation were to be prohibited in the future. The present index was compiled by Arias Montanus (1527-1598). It exerted considerable influence as it laid the foundation for the following Spanish Index of Quiroga and was among ""those expurging indexes"" which prompted the Areopagitica. This ""Antwerp Index was printed by Plantin, who had been designated ""prototypographus ""by Philip II, responsible for all local printers' oaths of fealty to the Crown and to the Church. Bound in with the Edict by Philip II of 15 February 1569 (= 1570 n.st.) in French, Dutch and Latin, in which Philip II of Spain forbids the printing, sale and circulation of Protestant heretical literature and reaffirms the earlier decrees formulated by his father, himself and the Council of Trent (1564). The Edict was formulated by the bloody Duke of Alva and was directed particularly against the circulation of anti-Catholic works in the Netherlands, where many Protestant refugees sought shelter. With an appendix imposed by the Duke of Alva on the Low Countries (1569). Sections in Latin (a large group of Bibles at the end), French, ""Duytsche verboden boeken"" (Dutch with a.o. Reynaert de Vos) and Spanish.
Authors listed: Agrippa., Gesner, Erasmus, Calvin, Zwingli, Rheticus, Henry VIII, Luther, Melancthon, Dolet, Servetus, Nicolas Udall, Rabelais, Robert Estienne, Thomas Platter, the Talmud.

The compilation and printing of this index was ordered by Philip II of Spain, in accordance with the precepts given by the Council of Trente. Plantin printed 750 copies of this apparently secret document for the king; not for sale, but to be distributed among censors, reliable printers and booksellers. The exclusive printing right for this work was accorded to the ''prototypographus regius'', by the Duke of Alba, with the warning not to change the text of the Index. In the struggle against the rising tide of Protestantism, the need for catalogues of forbidden books became obvious. The Council of Trente in 1563 laid down the rules to be followed in the future and made an `official'' index, which was published by order of Pius IV in 1564. Philip II in his zeal for the orthodox faith ordered Plantin to print the index together with additions relevant for the Low Countries in 1569 (re-editions in 1570).",18th Century Polished Calf,150 x 95,Index Librorum Prohibitorum1570-1.jpg,Index Librorum Prohibitorum1570-2.jpg,Index Librorum Prohibitorum1570-3.jpg,Index Librorum Prohibitorum1570-4.jpg,Jeffrey Mancevice,E4

Ouvrage très rare, comme la plupart des livres du médecin et humaniste Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia (Regalbuto, 1510 - Palerme, 1580), surnommé « l’Hippocrate sicilien ».

La Iatropologia est un recueil de questions et disputes médicales dirigées contre la médecine arabe, concernant aussi bien la chirurgie que les épidémies ; la seconde partie est plus particulièrement consacrée aux blessures du crâne.  Après des études de médecine à Padoue, Ingrassia se rendit à Naples où il enseigna à partir de 1544. Il traduisit et commenta les traités de Galien, fit oeuvre de précurseur dans les domaines de la médecine légale et de la santé publique, et distingua le premier la scarlatine de la rougeole. On lui doit aussi, parmi d’autres découvertes anatomiques, l’identification du petit os de l’oreille appelé étrier. Agréable exemplaire en vélin d’époque.
Le verso du troisième feuillet liminaire, incorrectement imprimé – il contient la deuxième page de l’épître répétée –, a été anciennement masqué par une feuille de papier blanc.

pp. [8], 68;  101, [3]; 112; 50, [2]","First edition of this uncommon book which contains one of the rarest writings of Vesalius — his 1562 concilium to Ingrassia, in which Vesalius clearly describes in great detail his surgical operation for empyema. This concilium is particularly important as it is the best evidence we have that Vesalius was a most expert surgeon as well as a great anatomist. Although treatment of empyema by surgery was referred to in classical times, it became unfashionable, and Vesalius seems to have been the first in modern times to revive the actual use of surgery for this illness. His concilium — which appears on pages 92-98 of the second part — was a remarkable piece of surgical writing for his time. Ingrassia’s reply to Vesalius, in which he congratulates him and declares him the first to operate for empyema, is found immediately following the concilium on pages 99-101. The same case also contains a consilium signed by Eustachius.

ff. lxv, [iii]; xviii","More than a few scholars of Spanish culture trace the beginnings of Spanish literature to the writings of St. Isidore of Seville, the native of Carthage whose brothers also became saints. Known also by the title Sententiarum libri tres, this is “the first collection of medieval sentences or systematic body of doctrine and pastoral practice and was inspired by the works of [St.] Augustine and Gregory I” (New Catholic Encyclopedia); here in a later printing. The contents are dogma (book I), moral problems (book II), and pastoral practice and law (book III). Added to this edition are the saint's musings on the misery of the human condition, i.e., his Libellus soliloquiorum de angustia & miseria hominis.

An interesting aspect of the work is that in Book I, Chapter X (De Mundo) is the earliest systematic formulation of the concept of the macrocosm/microcosm.

Surrounding the black-letter type of the title-page is an elaborate single-element woodcut frame incorporating columns, urns, vines, and mythical figures. The text is printed in an interesting roman type with a number of modified gothic capitals. Some initial spaces with guide letters are found in the section of soliloquies.

John of Gaddesden (1280?–1361), was an English physician who wrote this treatise  in 1314 according to Cholmeley.  This is exactly contemporaneous with Mundinus' Anatomia.

John was born about 1280, and wrote in the early part of the fourteenth century. He took his name from Gaddesden on the borders of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire, where an ancient house, opposite that gate of Ashridge Park which is nearest to the church of Little Gaddesden, is shown as his. He was a member of Merton College (Wood), and a doctor of physic of Oxford. He began to study medicine about 1299, and soon attained large practice in London.

Thomas Fuller, Worthies: JOHN de GATESDEN was undoubtedly born in this County, wherein two Villages, the Greater and Lesse of that name; Such who except that they are writ∣ten Gadesden, will soon be satisfied in their Sameness from those who know the Sym∣pathy betwixt T. and D.

 That a *Forraigner compiling a Catalogue of men eminent in that faculty, acknowledgeth him a Writer of high esteem therein. By * one who hath made a List of Learned men, he is styled Johannes Anglicus. I am in∣formed that lately his Books have been printed in Italy in a Folio; No small Honour (I assure you) Seeing in Physick the Italians account all Tramountain Doctors but Apo∣thecaries in comparison of themselves. The first Treatise in his Book is termed *Rosa Anglica, The English Rose, and I doubt not, but as it is Sweet in the Title, so it is Soveraign in the matter therein contained. This John flourished in the year of our Lord 1320.

He treated a son of Edward I, probably Thomas of Brotherton, for smallpox. He was the first Englishman to be appointed physician to the English monarch (Edward II).

Between 1305 and 1307 he wrote a treatise on medicine, which soon became famous, entitled Rosa Medicinæ. He chose the name, he said, because as the rose has five petals, so his book has five parts, and adds that as the rose excels all flowers, so his book excels all treatises on the practice of medicine. The title was probably suggested by Bernard de Gordon's Lilium Medicinæ, which appeared at Montpellier in 1303, and is quoted in the Rosa.

Gaddesden's book is often spoken of as Rosa Anglica. It is filled  with quotations from Galen, Pedanius Dioscorides, Rufus of Ephesus, Hali Abbas, Serapion, Al Rhazes, Avicenna, Averroes, John of Damascus, Isaac, Masawaiyh (Mesuë), Gilbertus Anglicus, and from the Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum, but also contains a good many original remarks which illustrate the character of the author more than his medical knowledge. The book begins with an account of fevers based on Galen's arrangement, then goes through diseases and injuries beginning with the head, and ends with an antidotarium (a treatise on remedies). It contains some remarks on cooking, and innumerable prescriptions, many of which are superstitious, while others prove to be common-sense remedies when carefully considered. He cared for his gains, and boasts of getting a large price from the Barber Surgeons' guild for a prescription of which the chief ingredient is tree frogs (Rosa, ed. Pavia, p. 120). His disposition, his peculiarities, and his reading are so precisely those of the ""Doctour of Phisik"" in Geoffrey Chaucer's prologue that it seems possible that Gaddesden is the contemporary from whom Chaucer drew this character.

Many manuscripts of the Rosa Medicinæ are extant. It was first printed at Pavia in 1492, again at Venice, 1502, and at Pavia, 1517, and for the last time at Augsburg in 1595 (two volumes). It was translated into Irish.

Gaddesden was in priest's orders, and was appointed to the stall of Wildland in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 1 Aug. 1342. He died in 1361.

The best account of his writings is in John Freind's History of Physick, 1726, ii. 277-293. This account contains the error, repeated by John Aikin's Biographical Memoirs of Medicine, 1780, pp. 9-11, that he held the stall of Ealdland. The John de Gatesdone who held this stall was another person, and died before 1262.

Later editions appeared in 1574 and 1581.  This first edition is not often mentioned and is lacking in many collections.  Although he was a Protestant, Joubert served as surgeon to the army under Henri d'Anjou and was Physician in Ordinary to Catherine de Medici.  He also was professor at Montpelier and served as dean and chancellor of the faculty for many years.  He made the French translations of Rondelet.

Latude about 1574 edition: Un des rares livres de chirurgie écrit en français à la Renaissance . Il contient neuf études sur le traitement des blessures d'arquebuses et diverses questions de médecine et de chirurgie. On traitait alors les plaies d'armes à feu en les brûlant à l'aide d'un fer rouge ou d'huile bouillante. Laurent Joubert, tout comme Ambroise Paré, montre l'absurdité de telles pratiques, les balles d'arcquebuse n'étant pas venimeuses comme on le croyait alors. Joubert répond dans cet ouvrage à quantité de questions, telles que : A l'amputation d'un membre, est-il bon de le couper à la jointure, ou vaut-il mieux s'en abstenir ? Ou bien : Est-il possible qu'aucun prenne la pissechaude vérolique par l'accointance d'une femme qui soit bien nette de vérole ? 
Médecin ordinaire d'Henri III et d'Henri IV, chancelier de l'Université de Montpellier, Laurent Joubert a écrit tous ses ouvrages en français, à destinations des chirurgiens qui pour la plupart n'entendaient pas le latin. Pour la Biographie médicale, cet ouvrage ""renferme les préceptes les plus judicieux sur la nature et le traitement des plaies d'armes à feu. Joubert prouve qu'elles ne sont point produites par le venin, ni la brûlure, et conclut que tout se borne à la contusion et à la solution d'unité."" Cette troisième édition est la plus complète. On y trouve pour la première fois plusieurs textes, dont : Une ""apologie de Nicolas Poget contre Joseph Du Chesne touchant le problème, s'il est possible d'envenimer les balles d'arcbouse"" et la ""Question des huiles, s'ils doivent être nécessaires à la curation des plaies, ulcères, tumeurs, douleurs & autres maux externes que traite le chirurgien."" La première édition date de 1574, la troisième a été augmentée de plus de 150 pages.

Édition originale des Annotations. Elles seront ensuite publiées à la suite des éditions ultérieures de Laurent Joubert de La Grande Chirurgie. Cet ouvrage, publié un an après la mort de Joubert, comporte une longue dédicace, les annotations portant sur chacun des sept traités de Guy de Chauliac et l'interprétation des langues. Cette « inter-prétation des langues » est une sorte de glossaire en quatre parties : dictions anatomiques, dictions pathologiques, médicaments, instruments et opérations chirurgicales ; la dernière partie renferme les gravures qui représentent des instruments de chirurgie et qui ont été empruntées pour la plupart à Ambroise Paré. La Grande Chirurgie de Guy de Chauliac a été imprimée originellement en 1478 (Printing and the Mind of Man, 21 ; En Français dans le Texte, 28 ; Garrison & Morton, 5556 et 3666.83). C'était le premier livre médical de cette importance publié en français, écrit avec méthode et clarté, et regroupant toutes les connaissances médico-chirurgicales du XIVe siècle. Guy de Chauliac est considéré comme le plus grand chirurgien du Moyen Age. Laurent Joubert (1529-1583) fut professeur et chancelier de l'université de Montpellier, médecin de Henri III et du roi de Navarre. Pourvu d'une grande érudition et possédant d'indéniables qualités littéraires, Joubert écrivit plusieurs ouvrages, qui font partie des oeuvres médicales les plus importantes de la Renaissance.

ff. 103","The Institutes has remained a resource for legal scholars over the centuries by presenting a more accessible, rationally ordered, and concise summary of the main concepts of Roman Law than the much larger and more comprehensive Digest; it was cited by the New York Supreme Court in a property law case as recently as 1805 (Online Resources, “The Medieval Law School”).

Justinian I (Flavius Anicius Justinianus), the nephew of Justin I, was proclaimed sole emperor and crowned along with his wife Theodora in 527.  His reign saw notable military successes, extending the territory of the Empire, and reuniting the East and West. But Justinian’s greatest legacy was as a legislator and promoter of the codification of Roman law.  The writings of the jurists were published as the Digesta of 533. The Codex, which compiled all of the extant imperial constitutions from the time of Hadrian, was published in 534. The Code was updated in a later work known as the Novellae in 556. The Institutes, Digest, Code and Novella together comprise what is known as the Corpus Juris Civilis, the Body of Civil Law.

Though largely forgotten for several centuries after the fall of the Western Empire, Roman law experienced a revival that began in Northern Italy in the eleventh century, blossomed at the university of Bologna in the twelfth, and spread throughout Europe. As a text studied at universities, copies of the Institutiones most often include extensive commentaries explaining the text copied in the margins.  Our copy was surely meant to be glossed in this way.  Only f. 31rv now includes an extensive marginal commentary added in the thirteenth century.  There are, however, brief notes in the margins: book 1 on f. 4 (partially trimmed); book 2, ff. 9-15; book 3, ff. 31v-37v; book 4, on ff. 37v-39.  Our text also includes interlinear glosses, noting variant readings (f. 1, “credendis” aliter credendam), expanding abbreviations, and adding brief explanations of words; a passage is marked “vacat” on f. 7.

Along with the Digest, Code and Novels, the Institutes is one of the writings known collectively as the Corpus Juris Civilis. Intended for students, the Institutes is an elementary treatise on Roman private law. Like its companion volumes, its subsequent influence on European jurisprudence is difficult to underestimate. It received a great deal of commentary during the medieval and early modern eras. The first significant commentator was Accorso (Accursius), a professor of law at the University of Bologna and a leading figure in the revival of classical jurisprudence. He examined every extant note and commentary when he prepared his epochal edition of the Institutes, Digest and Code. This massive effort eliminated much of the obscurity and contradiction introduced by earlier writers. His gloss on this edition, which superseded all previous attempts, was often cited as the Glossa Ordinaria or Magistralis. It remained definitive until its 1583 revision by Denis Godefroy.
